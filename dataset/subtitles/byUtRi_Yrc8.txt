utt_0000 utt 5.74 11.28 -X CREATIVE WORKFLOWS FOR GENERATING GRAPHICAL DOCUMENTS INVOLVE COMPLEX AND RELATED TASKS,
utt_0001 utt 11.28 17.71 -X SUCH AS ALIGNING ELEMENTS RETRIEVING APPROPRIATE IMAGES OR CHOOSING AESTHETICALLY HARMONIOUS COLORS
utt_0002 utt 18.00 30.87 -X IN THIS WORK, WE ATTEMPT AT BUILDING A HOLISTIC MODEL THAT CAN JOINTLY SOLVE MANY DIFFERENT DESIGN TASKS. TO DO SO WE PROPOSE FLEXDM, WHICH IS SHORT FOR FLEXIBLE DOCUMENT MODEL.
utt_0004 utt 32.69 39.86 -X FLEXDM'S KEY IDEA IS DOING MASKED FIELD PREDICTION IN MULTI-MODAL DOCUMENT DOMAIN AS A UNIFIED
utt_0005 utt 39.86 48.85 -X INTERFACE. WITH THIS VIEW, VARIOUS DESIGN TASKS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY JUST CHANGING A MASKING PATTERN.
utt_0006 utt 48.85 56.63 -X WE EXPERIMENTALLY SHOW THAT FLEXDM SUCCESSFULLY SOLVES VARIOUS DESIGN TASKS AND HERE IS AN EXAMPLE.
utt_0007 utt 60.81 75.20 -X WE ARE GOING TO EXPLAIN FURTHER DETAILS. FIRST, LET US BRIEFLY DESCRIBE A DEFINITION OF A VECTOR GRAPHIC DOCUMENT. IT IS A DATA FORMAT COMMONLY USED FOR MAKING VISUAL DESIGNS, SUCH AS CREATING A
utt_0009 utt 75.20 81.68 -X BANNER IN PHOTOSHOP. AS SHOWN AT THE BOTTOM, THE DOCUMENT CONSISTS OF A SET OF VISUAL ELEMENTS,
utt_0010 utt 81.68 87.83 -X WHERE EACH ELEMENT HAS VARIOUS PROPERTIES SUCH AS IMAGES, TEXTS, LAYOUTS, AND FINE-GRAINED
utt_0011 utt 87.83 97.33 -X STYLING ATTRIBUTES. IT IS SCALABLE, EDITABLE, AND HUMAN INTERPRETABLE. RESEARCH ON VECTOR GRAPHIC
utt_0012 utt 97.33 103.60 -X DOCUMENTS IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL TOPICS FOR AI-COLLABORATIVE DESIGN BUT UNDEREXPLORED.
utt_0013 utt 106.06 118.49 -X SINCE VECTOR GRAPHIC DOCUMENT IS STRUCTURED AND COMPLEX, ONE USUALLY PERFORMS ITERATIVE DECISION-MAKING STEPS TO CREATE A VECTOR GRAPHIC DOCUMENT. BELOW WE SHOW SOME TYPICAL STEPS.
utt_0015 utt 119.35 124.57 -X WE CALL EACH STEP A DESIGN TASK.
utt_0016 utt 124.57 136.34 -X THE WIDE VARIETY OF POSSIBLE ACTIONS AND COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MULTIMODAL ELEMENTS CHARACTERIZES DESIGN TASKS. RATHER THAN AN EXPERT MODEL FOR SINGLE TASK, WE ARE
utt_0018 utt 136.34 143.83 -X MORE INTERESTED IN A FLEXIBLE APPROACH THAT CAN HANDLE MANY DESIGN TASKS IN A PRINCIPLED MANNER.
utt_0019 utt 143.83 157.43 -X WE DEVELOPED A FLEXIBLE APPROACH BASED ON A SIMPLE AND WELL-KNOWN IDEA, PREDICTING MASKED PART OF THE DATA FROM THE REST. WE CALL IT MASKED FIELD PREDICTION. ALTHOUGH IT MAY REMIND OF
utt_0021 utt 157.43 164.23 -X MASKED IMAGE MODELING OR MASK LANGUAGE MODELING, THE KEY DISTINCTION IS THAT WE ARE HANDLING
utt_0022 utt 164.23 178.90 -X DOCUMENTS WITH MULTIMODAL FIELDS AND HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE. THIS DISTINCTION LEADS TO NON-TRIVIAL CHALLENGES SUCH AS HOW TO ENCODE OR DECODE VARIOUS TYPE OF FIELDS, OR HOW TO HANDLE
utt_0024 utt 178.90 187.16 -X LARGER NUMBER OF FIELDS EFFICIENTLY. WE PROPOSE A NETWORK FOR SOLVING MASKED FIELD PREDICTION.
utt_0025 utt 187.16 194.20 -X OUR NETWORK FIRST ENCODES EACH FIELD INTO FEATURES BY AN ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIC ENCODER.
utt_0026 utt 194.20 202.52 -X THE ENCODED FEATURES INSIDE EACH LAYOUT ELEMENT ARE THEN AGGREGATED BY SUMMATION.
utt_0027 utt 202.52 209.37 -X NEXT, WE USE STANDARD TRANSFORMER ENCODER BLOCKS TO CONSIDER ELEMENT-LEVEL INTERACTION.
utt_0028 utt 209.37 217.75 -X FINALLY, ELEMENT LEVEL FEATURES ARE DECODED BACK TO EACH FIELD BY AN ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIC DECODER.
utt_0029 utt 218.17 231.55 -X THIS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE IS FOR TACKLING THE CHALLENGES MENTIONED EARLIER. FIRST, THE VARIETY OF FIELDS IS HANDLED BY AN ATTRIBUTE-SPECIFIC ENCODER AND DECODER. SECOND, COMPUTATIONAL COST
utt_0031 utt 231.55 237.63 -X OF MODELING A LARGE NUMBER OF FIELDS IS ALLEVIATED BY CONSIDERING INTERACTIONS ONLY IN ELEMENT-LEVEL.
utt_0032 utt 240.02 254.49 -X TO TRAIN A MODEL FOR MASKED FIELD PREDICTION, WE EMPLOY TWO-STEP TRAINING. WE FIRST PERFORM IN-DOMAIN PRE-TRAINING BY RANDOMLY MASKING fifteen% OF THE FIELDS. THEN WE CONDUCT MULTITASK LEARNING ON TARGET
utt_0034 utt 254.49 268.06 -X DESIGN TASKS. SIMILARLY TO MASKED LANGUAGE MODELING, THE MODEL IS LEARNED TO MINIMIZE THE RECONSTRUCTION LOSS. SINCE PROCESSING HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA SUCH AS RAW IMAGES AND TEXTS DURING OPTIMIZATION IS
utt_0036 utt 268.06 281.69 -X COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE, WE EXTRACT A LOW-DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL VECTOR FROM SUCH DATA , USING PRE-TRAINED MODELS. WE SHOW SOME PREDICTIONS OF FLEXDM TRAINED AND TESTED ON THE CRELLO DATASET
utt_0038 utt 281.69 295.36 -X , WHICH CONTAINS VARIOUS GRAPHIC DESIGNS SUCH AS PANELS AND POSTERS. HERE THE TASK IS TO PREDICT FONT ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS FONT COLOR. THE TEXT IS RENDERED USING PRE-SET FONT ATTRIBUTES IN THE INPUT.
utt_0040 utt 296.02 303.61 -X OUR MODEL PREDICTS PLAUSIBLE COLOR, RESULTING IN HIGH CONTRAST TEXTS THAT ARE EASY TO SEE.
utt_0041 utt 303.96 314.78 -X HERE THE TASK IS TO PREDICT TEXT CONTENTS THAT MATCH WITH THE SURROUNDING IMAGES AND EMBELLISHMENTS. THE TARGET TEXTS TO BE PREDICTED IN THE INPUT ARE
utt_0043 utt 314.78 321.92 -X DEPICTED AS REPEATING T-E-X-T IN A CAPITAL LETTER. THE RETRIEVED TEXTS MATCH THE CONTEXT.
utt_0044 utt 323.58 328.32 -2.5917 HERE THE TASK IS TO RECOMMEND ONE MORE ELEMENT BY PREDICTING ALL THE FIELDS.
