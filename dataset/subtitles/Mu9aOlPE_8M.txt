utt_0000 utt 0.14 10.32 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE THE FIRST EXPLAINABLE FACE RECOGNITION BENCHMARK AND INTRODUCE NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART ALGORITHMS FOR THE EXPLAINABLE FACE RECOGNITION PROBLEM.
utt_0002 utt 10.32 21.17 -X IN THIS PRESENTATION, I WILL FIRST INTRODUCE THE EXPLAINABLE FACE RECOGNITION OR XFR PROBLEM AND THEN INTRODUCE OUR NOVEL BENCHMARK AND PROTOCOL, WHICH WE CALL THE INPAINTING GAME.
utt_0004 utt 21.48 29.71 -X AFTER BRIEFLY INTRODUCING THE XFR ALGORITHMS, I WILL THEN SHOW THEIR EVALUATIONS ON three FACE MATCHERS.
utt_0006 utt 29.71 35.67 -X FACE MATCHERS ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN IMAGES USING GALLERIES CAN CONTAIN MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
utt_0008 utt 35.79 43.31 -X FOR THIS IMAGE, A FACE MATCHER MIGHT RETURN OBAMA AS THE TOP MATCH AND AN IMPERSONATOR AS THE NEXT TOP MATCH.
utt_0010 utt 43.76 50.00 -X BUT WHY DID IT DECIDE THIS IS A PICTURE OF OBAMA OVER THE NEXT TOP MATCH OR OTHER MATCHES?
utt_0011 utt 50.00 53.14 -X THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF EXPLAINABLE FACE RECOGNITION.
utt_0012 utt 53.23 59.25 -X UNDERSTANDING THE DECISION MADE BY A FACE MATCHER IS IMPORTANT FOR HUMANS TO TRUST AND INTERPRET IT.
utt_0014 utt 59.82 67.06 -X IN THIS CASE WE KNOW THE CORRECT ANSWER, BECAUSE WE SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED THE IMPERSONATOR BY CHANGING ONLY THE EYEBROW REGIONS.
utt_0016 utt 67.31 70.55 -X WE CALL THIS SYNTHETIC IDENTITY A DOPPELGANGER.
utt_0017 utt 70.99 77.24 -X THEREFORE, WE CAN EVALUATE XFR ALGORITHMS BY HOW WELL THEY CAN DETECT THE MODIFIED REGIONS.
utt_0018 utt 77.26 83.80 -X IN OUR BENCHMARK WE PROVIDE ONE OR MORE IMAGES FOR EACH REFERENCE IDENTITY TO THE FACE MATCHER,
utt_0019 utt 83.98 87.57 -X SO THAT THE FACE MATCHER CAN FORM TEMPLATES FOR EACH IDENTITY.
utt_0020 utt 87.79 92.85 -X FOR OBAMA, WE USED THESE TWO IMAGES TO FORM THE TEMPLATE FOR THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT IDENTITY
utt_0021 utt 93.58 99.54 -X AND MODIFIED VERSIONS OF THOSE TWO IMAGES FOR THE CORRESPONDING DOPPELGANGER IDENTITIES.
utt_0022 utt 99.79 110.13 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE EYEBROWS ARE MODIFIED, BUT OTHER REGIONS ARE MODIFIED TO FORM OTHER DOPPELGANGERS WHERE THE NOSE, MOUTH, AND OTHER REGIONS ARE MODIFIED.
utt_0024 utt 110.64 116.09 -X THIS FORMS A TRIPLET OF A PROBE IMAGE AND THE MATED AND NONMATED IDENTITY TEMPLATES.
utt_0025 utt 116.56 127.09 -X WHEN THE FACE MATCHER IS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE ORIGINAL AND DOPPELGANGER IDENTITIES AND CORRECTLY MATCH THE PROBE TO THE MATED REFERENCE, WE POSE THE QUESTION TO THE XFR ALGORITHM,
utt_0027 utt 127.28 131.80 -X WHY DID THE FACE MATCHER MATCH THE PROBE TO THE MATED REFERENCE OVER THE NON-MATE?
utt_0028 utt 131.80 138.39 -X SPECIFICALLY, WHICH PIXELS BELONG IN A REGION THAT IS DISCRIMINATIVE FOR THE MATE - I.E.
utt_0029 utt 138.39 141.62 -X A REGION THAT IS MORE SIMILAR TO THE MATE THAN THE NON-MATE.
utt_0030 utt 141.91 146.36 -X THE RESULTING PIXEL SALIENCY ESTIMATIONS FORM A SALIENCY MAP.
utt_0031 utt 146.80 153.43 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, WE ARE SHOWING THE RESULT OF THE SUBTREE EBP ALGORITHM ON THE RESNETminus one hundred and one NETWORK.
utt_0033 utt 153.52 158.52 -X IN THIS CASE, THE HIGHLIGHTED REGION IS CLOSE TO THE EYEBROWS, BUT CENTERED ON THE EYES.
utt_0034 utt 158.68 164.06 -X THE NEXT ALGORITHM DISE, DOES A BETTER JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THE EYEBROW REGION.
utt_0035 utt 164.06 165.72 -X SO HOW CAN WE QUANTIFY THIS?
utt_0036 utt 165.88 172.82 -X AS THE FIRST APPROXIMATION, WE CAN ALSO GENERATE THE EYEBROW MASK OF THE PROBE IMAGE AND USE THIS AS THE GROUND TRUTH.
utt_0038 utt 172.92 178.58 -X THE SALIENCY MAPS CONSIST OF ESTIMATES FOR EACH PIXEL ON WHETHER THAT PIXEL IS SALIENT.
utt_0039 utt 178.90 188.22 -X WE CAN APPLY A THRESHOLD TO THE CONFIDENCE LEVELS FOR BINARY CLASSIFICATION, HERE THE WHITE PIXELS ARE PREDICTED AS BEING SALIENT AND BLACK AS NON-SALIENT.
utt_0041 utt 188.37 197.59 -X FOR THE GROUND TRUTH, THE PIXELS OUTSIDE OF THE INPAINTED MASK REGION ARE THE NON-SALIENT PIXELS AND THE PIXELS WITHIN ARE ASSUMED TO BE SALIENT.
utt_0043 utt 197.72 202.97 -X WE CAN USE A SLIDING THRESHOLD TO DETERMINE THE DETECTION ERROR TRADEOFF CURVES.
utt_0044 utt 202.97 213.18 -X FOR THIS EXAMPLE, TRIPLET AND NETWORK, THE DISE ALGORITHM PERFORMS BETTER THAN THE SUBTREE EBP ALGORITHM BECAUSE IT HAS A HIGHER TRUE POSITIVE RATE AT EACH FALSE POSITIVE RATE.
utt_0046 utt 213.33 220.44 -X A PROBLEM WITH THIS EVALUATION METHOD IS THAT SOME PIXELS WITHIN THE INPAINTED MASK REGION MIGHT NOT BE SALIENT.
utt_0048 utt 220.66 227.58 -X THIS EVALUATION METHOD PENALIZES THE ALGORITHMS WHEN THEY DO NOT SELECT THE ENTIRE INPAINTED MASK REGION.
utt_0050 utt 227.61 241.27 -X SO THE TRUE POSITIVE RATE IS NOT THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF PERFORMANCE, ALTHOUGH THE FALSE POSITIVE RATE IS RELIABLE, BECAUSE, WE KNOW THAT THE REGIONS THAT WERE NOT MODIFIED CANNOT BE SALIENT BECAUSE THEY ARE IDENTICAL.
utt_0053 utt 241.27 250.11 -X IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE EVALUATION, WE FIRST CREATE AN INPAINTED DOPPELGANGER OF THE PROBE IMAGE, INPAINTING THE SAME FACIAL REGION.
utt_0055 utt 250.58 262.68 -X THEN, DURING THE EVALUATION, WE CREATE BLENDED PROBES, WHERE THE PIXELS CLASSIFIED AS SALIENT ARE TAKEN FROM THE DOPPELGANGER AND THE PIXELS CLASSIFIED AS NON-SALIENT ARE TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL PROBE.
utt_0058 utt 263.74 271.04 -X THIS BLENDED PROBE IS THEN CLASSIFIED BY THE FACE MATCHER AS BEING THE ORIGINAL OR DOPPELGANGER IDENTITY.
utt_0060 utt 271.22 277.52 -X THE GOAL OF THE XFR ALGORITHM IS THEN TO FLIP THE CLASSIFICATION FROM THE ORIGINAL IDENTITY
utt_0061 utt 277.62 287.04 -X TO THE DOPPELGANGER IDENTITY WITH THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF PIXELS FROM OUTSIDE THE INPAINTED MASK REGION BEING MISCLASSIFIED AS BEING SALIENT.
utt_0063 utt 287.51 295.29 -X HERE WE COMPARE THE THRESHOLDED SALIENCY AT THE POINT WHERE THE FACE MATCHER STARTS TO CLASSIFY THE BLENDED PROBE AS THE INPAINTED NONMATE.
utt_0065 utt 295.55 306.11 -X THE DISE ALGORITHM HAS ONLY INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED A FEW PIXELS AS BEING SALIENT WHEN THE BLENDED PROBE WAS FIRST CLASSIFIED AS THE INPAINTED NON-MATE.
utt_0067 utt 307.45 316.48 -X THE SUBTREE EBP INCORRECTLY CLASSIFIED MANY MORE PIXELS AS BEING SALIENT BY THE TIME ITS BLENDED PROBE WAS CLASSIFIED AS THE INPAINTED NONMATE.
utt_0069 utt 316.54 319.90 -X THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE TRIPLET.
utt_0070 utt 319.90 325.12 -X THE INPAINTING GAME TAKES THE MEAN NON-MATE CLASSIFICATION RATE OVER MANY TRIPLETS.
utt_0071 utt 325.72 332.26 -X HERE ARE A SUBSET OF THE UNMODIFIED IMAGES TAKEN FROM ninety-five SUBJECTS OF THE INPAINTING GAME DATASET.
utt_0073 utt 332.57 335.65 -X WE DEFINE eight FACIAL REGIONS FOR EVALUATION.
utt_0074 utt 335.77 338.66 -X HENCE, EACH PROBE CAN FORM eight TRIPLETS.
utt_0075 utt 339.07 342.91 -X HOWEVER, NOT ALL TRIPLETS CAN BE USED FOR ALL FACE MATCHERS.
utt_0081 utt 356.41 363.20 -X HERE WE INTRODUCE THE BLACKBOX DISE XFR ALGORITHM, WHICH PERFORMS THE BEST ON THE DEEPER FACE MATCHER MODELS.
utt_0083 utt 363.42 367.90 -X DISE STANDS FOR DENSITY-BASED INPUT SAMPLING FOR EXPLANATION.
utt_0084 utt 367.90 382.69 -X OUR APPROACH EXTENDS RISE BY USING THE DENSITY DERIVED FROM EXCITATION BACKPROP AS A NON-UNIFORM PRIOR FOR GENERATING THE RANDOM BINARY MASKS, RESTRICTING THE MASKS TO USE A SPARSE, FIXED NUMBER OF MASK ELEMENTS.
utt_0087 utt 382.97 391.78 -X WE BUILD THE FINAL SALIENCY MAP BY TAKING A LINEAR COMBINATION OF MASKS WEIGHTED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INDUCED CHANGE IN THE TRIPLET LOSS.
utt_0089 utt 391.87 398.99 -X THE OTHER XFR ALGORITHM WE INTRODUCE IN THE PAPER IS CALLED SUBTREE EBP, WHICH IS A WHITEBOX
utt_0090 utt 399.01 404.13 -X XFR ALGORITHM THAT EXTENDS TO THE EXCITATION-BACKPROPAGATION ALGORITHM.
utt_0091 utt 404.45 417.92 -X SUBTREE EBP EXPLORES THE ACTIVATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL NODES IN A CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK THAT MINIMIZES A TRIPLET LOSS, WHICH MAXIMIZES SIMILARITY TO THE MATE AND MINIMIZES SIMILARITY TO THE NONMATE.
utt_0094 utt 418.24 428.84 -X THE EXCITATORY REGIONS FOR EACH NODE ARE VISUALIZED INDEPENDENTLY, SORTED BY LOSS AND COMBINED INTO A SALIENCY MAP THAT BEST EXPLAINS HOW TO DISCRIMINATE THE PROBE.
utt_0096 utt 428.84 434.92 -X WE EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE five DIFFERENT XFR ALGORITHMS ON three DIFFERENT FACE MATCHERS.
utt_0097 utt 435.20 442.21 -X THE FIRST TWO METHODS, DISE AND SUBTREE EBP ARE NOVEL METHODS THAT WE INTRODUCE IN OUR PAPER.
utt_0099 utt 442.53 450.82 -X THE CONTRASTIVE EBP, TRUNCATED CONTRASTIVE EBP, AND MEAN EBP ARE METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED.
utt_0101 utt 451.55 459.65 -X THE FACE MATCHERS WE EVALUATED WERE LIGHTCNN, VGGFACEtwo RESNETminus fifty, AND A CUSTOM RESNETminus one hundred and one
utt_0102 utt 459.71 460.58 -X NETWORK.
utt_0103 utt 460.86 470.98 -X WE CHOSE THESE NETWORKS IN ORDER TO COVER NETWORKS WITH A VARIETY OF DEPTHS, WITH LIGHTCNN BEING THE SHALLOWEST AND OUR RESNETminus one hundred and one BEING THE DEEPEST.
utt_0105 utt 471.20 480.39 -X NOTE THAT SUBTREE EBP PERFORMS THAT BEST ON SHALLOWER LIGHTCNN NETWORK, WHILE DISE PERFORMS THE BEST ON THE RESNETminus fifty AND THE RESNETminus one hundred and one.
utt_0107 utt 480.90 486.34 -X THE OVERALL RESULTS ON THE STR RESNETminus one hundred and one IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE RESNETminus fifty.
utt_0108 utt 487.14 492.61 -X WE ALSO EVALUATED THE RESULTS SEPARATELY ON EACH FACE REGION ON THE RESNETminus one hundred and one NETWORK.
utt_0109 utt 492.64 498.98 -X HERE WE SHOW JUST THE RESULTS FROM OUR TOP TWO PERFORMING METHODS FOR THE EYEBROW-INPAINTED DOPPELGANGERS.
utt_0111 utt 499.62 504.77 -X THE PIXEL EVALUATIONS ARE SHOWN AT THE THRESHOLD WHERE THE NETWORK FLIPS THE BLENDED PROBE’S
utt_0113 utt 509.38 513.35 -X THE RESULTS THAT SHOW THE LEAST AMOUNT OF RED PERFORM THE BEST.
utt_0114 utt 513.57 521.06 -X FOR DETECTING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE EYEBROW REGION, DISE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN SUBTREE EBP FOR THIS FACE MATCHER.
utt_0116 utt 521.06 524.55 -X FOR OTHER MODIFIED REGIONS, THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT SO LARGE.
utt_0117 utt 524.61 530.57 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HERE WE SHOW THE RESULTS OF RUNNING THE XFR ALGORITHMS ON THE LEFT- AND RIGHT-
utt_0118 utt 530.57 532.14 -X FACE INPAINTED REGIONS.
utt_0119 utt 532.52 538.38 -X BOTH XFR ALGORITHMS HAVE DIFFICULTY DETECTING THE ASYMMETRY OF THE MODIFIED CHANGES.
utt_0120 utt 538.40 543.98 -X THE EXAMPLES OF THE OTHER REGIONS CAN BE FOUND IN OUR PAPER’S SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS.
utt_0121 utt 544.07 550.15 -X IN CONCLUSION, WE INTRODUCED THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK FOR EXPLAINABLE FACE RECOGNITION,
utt_0122 utt 550.15 557.10 -X WHICH USES A NEW QUANTITATIVE METHOD CALLED THE INPAINTING GAME FOR COMPARING XFR ALGORITHMS.
utt_0123 utt 557.22 565.45 -X THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DISE AND SUBTREE EBP METHODS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART.
utt_0125 utt 565.96 578.57 -X HOWEVER, THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENT XFR ALGORITHMS MAY NOT YET BE RELIABLE ENOUGH FOR DISCRIMINATING EXACTLY WHY A FACE MATCHER MATCHES ONE IDENTITY OVER A CLOSELY RELATED IDENTITY.
utt_0128 utt 578.92 590.19 -X WE BELIEVE THIS FORM OF QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION IS CRUCIAL FOR FUTURE WORK IN EXPLAINABLE AI FOR FACE RECOGNITION AND OTHER FINE-GRAINED CLASSIFICATION OF EXPLAINABLE AI.
