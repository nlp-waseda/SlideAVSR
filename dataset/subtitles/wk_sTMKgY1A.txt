utt_0000 utt 0.22 15.22 -X HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS BRYAN WANG I'M A SECOND-YEAR MASTERS STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO. IN THIS VIDEO I'M GOING TO PRESENT BLYNCSYNC ENABLING MULTIMODAL SMARTWATCH GESTURES WITH SYNCHRONOUS TOUCH AND BLINK THIS IS A
utt_0003 utt 15.22 26.51 -X JOINT WORK WITH MY ADVISER TOVI GROSSMAN AT THE DYNAMIC GRAPHICS PROJECT LAB. SO SMARTWATCHES HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR YET THEIR LIMITED
utt_0005 utt 26.51 38.87 -X FORM FACTOR MAKES INPUT A CHALLENGE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM PRIOR WORK HAS TRIED TO INCREASE THE RECEPTIVE AREA OF TOUCH INPUT OR REDUCE THE CONTACT AREA OF
utt_0007 utt 38.87 51.12 -X CHARGE TO INCREASE THE PRECISION ON THE OTHER HANDS EYE-BASED INPUT HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO PROVIDE SUBTLE, INSTANT, AND HANDS-FREE INTERACTION WHAT YOU LOOK IS
utt_0009 utt 51.12 62.64 -X WHAT YOU GET HOWEVER HUMAN EYES ARE MEANT TO SERVE AS PERCEPTIVE ORGANS AND DID NOT EVOLVE TO BE FULLY CONTROLLABLE AS SUCH THEY ARE PRONE TO FALSE
utt_0011 utt 62.64 74.52 -X ACTIVATIONS EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK ANOTHER COMMAND IS ACTIVATED, NAMELY THE MIDAS TOUCH PROBLEM. SO WE ASK A QUESTION IF INDIVIDUAL INPUTS ARE LIMITED CAN WE
utt_0013 utt 74.52 85.72 -X COMBINE THEM TOGETHER TO SOLVE EACH OTHER'S LIMITATIONS. ACTUALLY COMBINING EYE PLUS TOUCH INPUT ISN'T NEWS PRIOR WORK HAS INVESTIGATED HOW TO USE THIS
utt_0015 utt 85.72 90.45 -X TWO INPUT MODALITIES SEQUENTIALLY TO ENABLE NOVEL INTERACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE
utt_0016 utt 90.64 102.98 -X USING GAZE TO SELECT AN ITEM THEN USE TOUCH TO MANIPULATE ON A TABLET OR IN A DESKTOP SETUP A USER CAN USE THEIR GAZE TO MOVE THE CURSOR INSTANTLY
utt_0018 utt 102.98 108.20 -X BETWEEN THESE TEN AREAS ON THE SCREEN THEN USE THE MOUSE TO FINETUNE THE SELECTION
utt_0019 utt 109.39 121.33 -X HOWEVER PRIOR WORK USUALLY ONLY USED EYES TO SUPPLEMENT THE OTHER PRIMARY INPUTS AND THE INTERACTIONS WERE MOSTLY SEQUENCE BASED SUCH AS GAZE SELECT FIRST
utt_0021 utt 121.33 132.09 -X THAN TOUCH MANIPULATE WE INSTEAD WONDERED WHY DON'T WE LET THE TWO INPUTS COMPLEMENT AND REINFORCE EACH OTHERS WE HOPED TO USE TOUCH TO REDUCE THE
utt_0023 utt 132.09 146.62 -X FALSE ACTIVATION PROBLEMS EYE INPUT AND WE WANT TO USE EYE INPUT TO ARGUMENT THE TOUCH INPUT WHEN THE INPUT EXPRESSIVITY IS LIMITED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN USING A SMARTWATCH. TO DO SO WE PROPOSED THE CONCEPT OF A MUTUAL
utt_0026 utt 146.62 159.78 -X DELIMITER. WE FIRST START FROM A DELIMITER WHAT IS A DELIMITER LET'S SAY WE HAVE A TIMELINE HERE AND WE HAVE A SERIES OF INPUT SIGNAL. THE USE OF THE DELIMITER IS
utt_0028 utt 159.78 174.31 -X TO DELIMIT A CERTAIN INTERVAL OF THAT SIGNAL WHERE THE SAME INPUT SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT MEANING OR FUNCTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU PRESS THE CONTROL KEY AND CLICKING ON ITEMS THE CLICKS WILL HAVE DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS THEN THE
utt_0031 utt 174.31 187.61 -X CONTROL KEY IS A DELIMITER OF THE MOUSE CLICK SO WHAT IS A MUTUAL DELIMITER LET'S SAY WE HAVE SIGNAL ONE HERE AND IT'S DELIMITED BY ANOTHER SIGNAL AND AT THE
utt_0033 utt 187.61 199.93 -X SAME TIME SIGNAL two IS ALSO DELIMITED BY SIGNAL one SO BOTH INPUTS DELIMIT EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME TO SOLVE EACH OTHER'S LIMITATIONS OUR GOAL IS THEN TO
utt_0035 utt 199.93 209.63 -X FIND OUT THE GESTURE SET THAT COULD SERVE AS THE MUTUAL DELIMITER TO ENHANCE BOTH INPUTS TOGETHER SO WE FIRST LOOK AT A LARGER DESIGN SPACE FOR EYE + TOUCH
utt_0037 utt 209.78 222.33 -X INPUT. WE CAN HAVE BLINK AND TOUCH WITH DIFFERENT DURATIONS SUCH AS LONG BLINK AND SHORT TOUCH. THE BLINK AND TOUCH EVENTS COULD ALSO HAPPEN IN
utt_0039 utt 222.33 236.25 -X SEQUENCE SUCH AS BLINK-BLINK-TOUCH OR BLINK-TOUCH-BLINK-TOUCH. IF A PAIR OF BLINK AND TOUCH HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME THEN THEY ARE SYNCHRONIZED AND WE CAN SEE THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF SYNCHRONIZATIONS HERE
utt_0042 utt 236.82 247.93 -X SYNCHRONOUS START, SYNCHRONOUS ENDS, AND SYNCHRONOUS STARTS AND ENDS. LASTLY WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT TOUCH GESTURES SUCH AS SWIPE AND TAP AND DIFFERENT EYE
utt_0044 utt 248.35 260.69 -X EXPRESSIONS LIKE GAZE, BLINK, AND WINK. THEN WE NARROWED DOWN THE DESIGN SPACE FIRSTLY WE HOPED THE GESTURE COULD BE PERFORMED RAPIDLY SO WE ONLY CONSIDER
utt_0046 utt 260.69 266.46 -X SHORT EVENTS. FOR THE SAME REASON, WE ALSO DIDN'T CONSIDER SEQUENTIAL INPUT
utt_0047 utt 267.61 281.50 -X AND WE DID NOT CONSIDER GAZE IN A GESTURE DESIGN BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT GAZE CAN BE INCORPORATED FOR SOME USE CASES WHICH I WILL DISCUSS LATER AND WE DISCARDED WINKS BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY TO PERFORMED BY EVERYONE SO
utt_0050 utt 284.12 290.46 -X HERE'S THE FINAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS SHORT SYNCHRONOUS BLINK AND TOUCH EVENTS.
utt_0051 utt 290.56 303.54 -X WE PRESENT BLYNCSYNC A GESTURE SET ENABLED BY PERFORMING A PAIR OF SYNCHRONOUS BLINK AND TOUCH ON A SMARTWATCH. TO PERFORM A BLYNCSYNC GESTURE USERS
utt_0053 utt 303.54 317.02 -X SIMPLY NEED TO BLINK AND TOUCH ON SMARTWATCH AT THE SAME TIME. THEN WE HAVE THESE GESTURES, WE WERE CURIOUS ABOUT HOW OFTEN WITH THIS GESTURE, A
utt_0055 utt 317.66 321.22 -X PAIR OF SYNCHRONOUS TOUCH AND BLINK HAPPENS SPONTANEOUSLY.
utt_0056 utt 322.40 327.62 -X TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WE CONDUCTED A twelve-PARTICIPANT USER STUDY GATHERING BLINK
utt_0057 utt 327.62 338.43 -X AND TOUCH DATA DURING NORMAL USE TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBABILITY OF FALSE ACTIVATIONS OF THIS GESTURE. WE DESIGNED FOUR TASKS WITH DIFFERENT TASK INTENSITIES
utt_0058 utt 338.43 348.96 -X AND PLATFORMS THE TWO SMARTWATCH TASKS ARE USING A CALCULATOR AND READING NEWSFEED AND THE TWO PAPER TASKS ARE SOLVING WORD PUZZLES AND READING
utt_0060 utt 348.96 361.46 -X ARTICLES. WE COLLECTED BOTH TOUCH AND BLINK DATA DURING THE STUDY. HERE'S THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RATES AND DURATION OF THE BLINK AND TOUCH. AS EXPECTED, TOUCH
utt_0062 utt 361.46 365.14 -X RATE IS HIGHER FOR CALCULATOR WHICH REQUIRES MORE TAPPING TO ENTER
utt_0063 utt 365.57 375.91 -X FORMULAS WHILE THE TOUCH DURATION IS LONGER FOR NEWSFEED WHICH REQUIRES MORE DRAGGING TO BROWSE NEWS. FOR BOTH SMARTWATCH AND PAPER TASKS THE BLINK
utt_0065 utt 375.91 385.86 -X RATES DROPPED WHEN A TASK INTENSITY INCREASED. THE BLINK DURATIONS WERE CONSISTENT ACROSS DIFFERENT TASKS BUT A LITTLE BIT LOWER FOR SOLVING WORD PUZZLES
utt_0067 utt 386.37 400.33 -X IT COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO A HEAVIER VISUAL WORKLOAD. AND REMEMBER THAT THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT HOW OFTEN WOULD A SYNCHRONOUS PAIR OF TOUCH AND BLINK HAPPEN. AND OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT IT'S ACTUALLY RARE FOR USERS TO PERFORM
utt_0070 utt 400.33 411.51 -X THIS GESTURE SPONTANEOUSLY. HERE'S A PLOT OF THE CALCULATED OFFSET EACH DOT IN THE PLOT IT'S A TOUCH EVENT, WITH ITS X-COORDINATES REPRESENTING ITS START
utt_0072 utt 411.51 423.37 -X OFFSET WITH ITS NEAREST BLINK EVENT, WHILE THE Y-COORDINATES REPRESENT THE END OFFSETS. AND WE CAN SEE THAT THE DOTS ARE QUITE SPARSE IN THE CENTRAL REGION
utt_0074 utt 423.37 434.79 -X WITH ONLY LESS THAN two% OF THE DATA POINTS FALL WITHIN A two50 MILLISECOND THRESHOLD. WE ALSO FOUND THAT IF WE CONSIDER BOTH START AND END OFFSETS
utt_0076 utt 434.79 446.49 -X WE'LL GET A LOWER FALSE ACTIVATION RATE. THEREFORE THE FINAL BLYNCSYNC GESTURE CONSISTS OF A BLINK SYNCHRONIZED WITH EITHER TAP OR SWIPE IN FOUR DIRECTIONS
utt_0078 utt 446.76 452.94 -X AND THE BLINK AND TOUCH EVENTS NEED TO BE SYNCHRONIZED IN BOTH START AND END WITH
utt_0079 utt 453.67 461.56 -X A two hundred and fifty MILLISECONDS THRESHOLD. WE THEN CONDUCTED A SECOND STUDY TO SEE WHETHER THE USERS
utt_0080 utt 461.80 469.19 -X WERE ABLE TO EASILY SYNCHRONIZE THE TWO CHANNELS OF SIGNALS -- BLINK AND TOUCH.
utt_0081 utt 469.19 479.37 -X WE COMPARED BLYNCSYNC WITH OTHER COMMONLY USED SMARTWATCH INPUT TECHNIQUES FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE OVERHEAD COST OF
utt_0083 utt 479.37 485.35 -X BLYNCSYNC GESTURES THESE TWO TECHNIQUES WERE TOUCH AFTER PRESSING A HARDWARE
utt_0086 utt 497.02 502.67 -X BLYCNSYNC ONLY ADDS zero point one five SECOND OVERHEAD TO NORMAL TOUCH BUT IT'S thirty-three%
utt_0087 utt 503.11 513.90 -X FASTER THAN PRESSING A HARDWARE BUTTONS AND WE FOUND THAT THE OFFSETS WERE WELL WITHIN THE THRESHOLD WE SET FOR A STUDY AND IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THAT
utt_0089 utt 513.90 525.04 -X OFFSET VALUES ARE LOWER FOR THE START TIME INDICATING THE POTENTIALS TO DEFINE SEPARATE THRESHOLDS FOR THE START AND END. COMBINING THIS DATA WITH THE RESULTS
utt_0091 utt 525.04 539.32 -X FROM STUDY one WE SUGGEST FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS CONSIDER OUR CHOSEN OFFSET OF two hundred and fifty MILLISECONDS WHICH ELICITED A TRUE POSITIVE RATE OF ninety-seven% WE'RE LIMITING THE FALSE POSITIVE RATES TO
utt_0094 utt 539.32 551.95 -X LESS THAN two%. BLYCNSYNC OCCUPIES A UNIQUE APPLICATION SPACE WHERE TWO INPUTS CAN AUGMENT EACH OTHER. SO LET'S FIRST START FROM BLINK AUGMENTED TOUCH
utt_0096 utt 551.95 562.46 -X IMPUT. WE DEVELOPED A MOCK-UP APPLICATION FOR SMARTWATCH SHORTCUT ON SYSTEM LEVEL FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CALLING THE MAIN MENU OR EXITING AN APPLICATION
utt_0098 utt 562.89 572.75 -X THESE FUNCTIONS ARE USUALLY ACHIEVED BY PRESSING HARDWARE BUTTONS. HOWEVER THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS ON A SMARTWATCH IS LIMITED. WITH BLYCNSYNC, WE CAN SOLVE
utt_0100 utt 572.75 584.21 -X THIS PROBLEM EASILY. FOR EXAMPLE, BLYCNSYNCLEFT AND BLYCNSYNCRIGHT CYCLES BETWEEN RECENTLY USED APPS.BLYCNSYNCTDOWN TERMINATES THE
utt_0102 utt 584.21 589.97 -X CURRENT APPLICATION. BLYCNSYNCUP SHOWS ALL RECENTLY USE APPS.
utt_0103 utt 592.17 603.44 -X ANOTHER APPLICATION SPACE IS TOUCH-AUGMENTED BLINK INPUT. WE DEVELOPED SEVERAL APPLICATIONS TO USE BLYCNSYNC FOR SMART ENVIRONMENT CONTROL BY LOOKING AT
utt_0105 utt 603.44 616.82 -X AN APPLIANCE AND PERFORMING A BLYCNSYNC GESTURE. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF USING BLYCNSYNC TO CONTROL LIGHT. TO TURN ON THE LIGHT, THE USER LOOKS AT IT AND PERFORM A
utt_0107 utt 616.82 624.47 -X BLYCNSYNCUP GESTURE A BLYCNSYNCTAP GESTURE CHANGES THE LIGHT SETTING. AND A
utt_0108 utt 624.59 637.22 -X BLYCNSYNCDOWN TURN OFF THE LIGHT. WE ALSO EXPLORED THE IDEA OF RETRIEVING A CONTEXTUAL USER INTERFACE, IF THE USER LOOKS AT A DEVICE AND
utt_0110 utt 637.22 644.11 -X PERFORM A BLYCNSYNC GESTURE, A UI WOULD BE EXTRACTED FROM THE DEVICE TO THE SMARTWATCH FOR THE USER TO CONTROL
utt_0112 utt 648.37 656.63 -X FINALLY, BLYCNSYNC CAN BE USED TO TRANSFER INFORMATION FROM SMARTWATCH TO OTHER DISPLAYS SUCH AS LAPTOPS OR TELEVISIONS
utt_0114 utt 663.63 667.01 -X OF COURSE, THERE ARE A FEW ISSUES SURROUNDING BLYCNSYNC GESTURES
utt_0115 utt 667.76 677.68 -X FIRSTLY, THE EYE-TRACKING TECHNOLOGY. IN OUR PROTOTYPE, THE USER NEEDS TO WEAR AN ADDITIONAL EYE TRACKER GLASSES, MAKING IT LESS ACCESSIBLE FOR COMMON USERS.
utt_0117 utt 678.74 689.14 -X FORTUNATELY, A JAPANESE COMPANY JINS RELEASED A PRODUCT CALLED JINS MEME WHICH LOOKS EXACTLY SIMILAR TO A COMMON EYEGLASSES THAT WE WEAR EVERY DAY
utt_0119 utt 689.52 699.99 -X THIS MAKES BLYNCSYNC POSSIBLE TO BE USED BY A WIDER AUDIENCE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. ANOTHER ISSUE IS FOR BLYCNSYNC TO AVOID
utt_0121 utt 699.99 710.44 -X CONFLICT WITH NORMAL TOUCH. BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL FOLLOWING BLINK AFTER A TOUCH EVENT THE BLYCNSYNC GESTURE RECOGNIZER NEEDS TO WAIT A SHORT TIME
utt_0123 utt 710.44 723.05 -X BEFORE CLASSIFYING THE EVENT AS A NORMAL TOUCH OR A BLYCNSYNC GESTURE. SO EVERY TOUCH INTERACTION WOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR A SHORT PERIOD TO BE EXECUTED. TO MITIGATE
utt_0125 utt 723.05 727.86 -X THIS, WE CAN CLASSIFY THE GESTURE RIGHT AFTER A TOUCH, IF THE USER'S EYES ARE OPEN.
utt_0126 utt 727.86 741.24 -X AND ONLY TAKES A SHORT PAUSE WHEN THE USER'S EYES ARE CLOSED. IN THIS WAY. THE USERS WOULD NOT EVEN NOTICE THAT SHORT PAUSE BECAUSE THEIR EYES ARE CLOSED.
utt_0128 utt 741.24 755.77 -X SO KEY TAKEAWAYS. one. WE PRESENT THE CONCEPT OF A MUTUAL DELIMITER WHERE TWO MODALITIES ARE USED TO JOINTLY DELIMIT THE INTENTION OF EACH OTHER'S INPUT THEREFORE INCREASING THE RESPECTIVE INPUT VOCABULARIES AND ADDRESSING ANY
utt_0131 utt 755.77 770.65 -X POTENTIAL ISSUES OF FALSE ACTIVATIONS. two. WE ALSO CONDUCTED TWO STUDIES SHOWING THAT IT IS RARE FOR HUMANS TO PERFORM SYNCHRONOUS TOUCH AND BLINK EVENTS SPONTANEOUSLY ON A SMARTWATCH. BUT WHEN THEY REALLY WANT TO DO SO THEY'RE
utt_0134 utt 770.65 774.78 -X CAPABLE OF PERFORMING SUCH GESTURES EASILY AND ACCURATELY
utt_0135 utt 776.41 787.19 -X LASTLY, WE DEVELOPED SEVERAL MOCK-UP APPLICATIONS FOR EXPLORING AND FUTURE POTENTIALS OF HOW BLYNCSYNC CAN BE USED TO INTERACT WITH THE VARIETY OF DEVICES
utt_0137 utt 789.21 795.64 -X WE HOPE OUR TECHNIQUES CAN SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE WORK ON MULTIMODAL WEARABLE INPUTS.
