utt_0000 utt 0.88 14.40 -X HELLO, I'M JUNGSOO LEE FROM KAIST AI AND I WILL TALK ABOUT OUR ICCV PAPER STANDARDIZED MAX LOGITS ACCEPTED AS AN ORAL PRESENTATION. WE ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM OF
utt_0002 utt 14.40 28.43 -X IDENTIFYING UNEXPECTED AND ANOMALOUS OBSTACLES IN URBAN SCENE SEGMENTATION. I CO-WORKED WITH SANGHUN JUNG, ANOTHER FIRST AUTHOR OF THIS WORK, DAEHOON GWAK, SUNGHA CHOI, AND PROFESSOR JAEGUL CHOO.
utt_0004 utt 31.15 37.87 -X WE WILL FIRST EXPLAIN THE MOTIVATION OF OUR WORK. A GIVEN PRE-TRAINED SEGMENTATION MODEL
utt_0005 utt 38.09 45.27 -X ALWAYS PREDICTS ALL THE PIXELS WITH THE PRE-DEFINED CLASSES USED FOR TRAINING.
utt_0006 utt 46.16 59.76 -X HOWEVER, THIS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC WHEN THE SEGMENTATION MODEL CONFRONTS UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES WHICH WERE NOT OBSERVED DURING THE TRAINING PHASE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE IMAGE, THE BOXES AND THE DOG
utt_0008 utt 59.82 67.41 -X ARE EXAMPLES OF UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES. HOWEVER, AS SHOWN IN THE IMAGE, THE MODEL PREDICTED
utt_0009 utt 67.41 75.14 -X SUCH ANOMALIES AS ONE OF THE PREDEFINED CLASSES WHICH IS ROAD IN THIS CASE. THIS CAUSES THE
utt_0010 utt 75.14 84.47 -X AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TO HIT THE BOXES AND DOG WHICH COULD HARM THE SAFETY SIGNIFICANTLY.
utt_0011 utt 84.47 95.93 -X IN ORDER TO HANDLE SUCH AN ISSUE, WE TRIED TO IDENTIFY THE ANOMALOUS PIXELS OF UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES WHICH MAY WORK AS THE STARTING POINTS OF HANDLING SUCH OBSTACLES
utt_0013 utt 95.99 103.22 -X DIFFERENTLY. BACK TO THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE, THIS ALLOWS THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TO STOP THE CAR
utt_0014 utt 103.35 107.35 -X OR CIRCUMVENT SUCH OBSTACLES AFTER DETECTING THEM.
utt_0015 utt 110.32 117.91 -X NOW LET ME TALK ABOUT THE PREVIOUS WORK ON THIS TOPIC. MAXIMUM SOFTMAX PROBABILITY OR MSP,
utt_0016 utt 117.91 126.23 -X IN SHORT, IS WIDELY USED FOR IDENTIFYING THE OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION SAMPLES. HOWEVER, IT SUFFERS
utt_0017 utt 126.23 140.57 -X FROM OVERCONFIDENT PROBLEM. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THE ISSUE, ANOTHER WORK PROPOSED TO USE THE VALUES BEFORE THE SOFTMAX FUNCTION FOR THE ANOMALY DETECTION, WHICH IS TERMED AS THE MAX LOGITS.
utt_0019 utt 143.44 150.30 -X THE TWO PLOTS VISUALIZE THE ANOMALY SCORES OF PIXELS OF IN-DISTRIBUTION AND OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION
utt_0020 utt 150.87 163.35 -X BY ADDRESSING THE OVERCONFIDENT PROBLEM. MAX LOGIT DECREASED THE GRAY REGIONS WHICH INDICATE THE OVERLAPPING REGIONS OF IN-DISTRIBUTION PIXELS AND OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION PIXELS,
utt_0022 utt 163.35 166.11 -X IMPROVING THE DETECTION CAPABILITY OVERALL.
utt_0023 utt 168.53 175.64 -X HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF EACH CLASS IN THE MAX LOGITS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERS FROM
utt_0024 utt 175.64 183.55 -X EACH OTHER IN THE URBAN SENSE SEGMENTATION. SINCE WE UTILIZE A SINGLE THRESHOLD FOR THE EVALUATION,
utt_0025 utt 183.55 187.99 -X ALIGNING THESE DIFFERENTLY FORMED DISTRIBUTIONS TO HAVE THE SAME MEAN AND VARIANCE
utt_0026 utt 188.15 195.23 -X IMPROVES THE DETECTION CAPABILITY. WE CALL SUCH A METHOD AS STANDARDIZED MAX LOGITS,
utt_0027 utt 195.23 203.42 -X SML, IN SHORT. BY APPLYING THE SML, WE FURTHER DECREASE THE GRAY REGIONS.
utt_0028 utt 204.54 209.15 -X LET ME SWITCH GEARS AND TALK ABOUT THE SUMMARY OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD.
utt_0029 utt 209.94 214.65 -X OUR METHOD IS COMPOSED OF THREE STEPS. FIRST,
utt_0030 utt 214.65 220.83 -X WE STANDARDIZE THE MAX LOGITS BY USING THE MEAN AND VARIANCE OBTAINED FROM THE TRAINING SAMPLES.
utt_0031 utt 221.59 228.51 -X THEN, WE SUPPRESS THE BOUNDARY REGIONS SINCE THE BOUNDARY REGIONS HAVE RELATIVELY LOW SML SCORES.
utt_0032 utt 229.79 236.89 -X FINALLY, WE REMOVE THE IRREGULARS WHICH WORK AS NOISES BY USING THE GAUSSIAN SMOOTHING KERNEL.
utt_0033 utt 237.63 240.00 -X LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT EACH STEP.
utt_0034 utt 242.78 249.02 -X FOR THE FIRST STEP, SML, WE CALCULATE THE MEAN AND VARIANCE OF EACH CLASS FROM THE TRAINING SET.
utt_0035 utt 249.95 253.79 -X THEN BY USING THE STATISTICS OBTAINED FROM THE TRAINING SET,
utt_0036 utt 253.79 257.57 -X WE STANDARDIZED THE MAX LOGITS DURING THE INFERENCE STAGE.
utt_0037 utt 260.35 273.28 -X THEN, WE PERFORM THE ITERATIVE BOUNDARY SUPPRESSION. WE FOUND THAT THE BOUNDARY REGIONS HAVE LOWER SML SINCE THE BOUNDARY REGIONS ARE WHERE THE CLASSES CHANGE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER.
utt_0039 utt 274.30 279.90 -X IN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THE IMAGE, THE WHITE PIXELS INDICATE THE PREDICTED ANOMALIES.
utt_0040 utt 280.22 284.90 -X WE CAN OBSERVE THAT THE BOUNDARY REGIONS ARE STILL IDENTIFIED AS ANOMALIES.
utt_0041 utt 287.77 295.28 -X THEREFORE, WE ITERATIVELY SUPPRESS THESE REGIONS IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE SML VALUES BY USING THE
utt_0042 utt 295.28 303.81 -X SO-CALLED BOUNDARY AWARE PULLING, BAP, IN SHORT. WE FIRST OBTAIN THE NON-BOUNDARY MASKS FROM THE
utt_0043 utt 303.81 310.88 -X SEGMENTATION PREDICTIONS. THEN, WE AVERAGE PULL THE SML VALUES BY APPLYING THE NON-BOUNDARY MASKS.
utt_0044 utt 312.03 319.04 -X WE REPEAT THIS PROCESS ITERATIVELY AND UPDATE THE SML VALUES.
utt_0045 utt 319.58 332.61 -X HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. WE FOUND THAT THERE STILL EXISTS IRREGULAR PIXELS REMAINING WHICH MAY WORK AS NOISES IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THIS ISSUE. WE APPLY
utt_0047 utt 332.83 345.80 -X GAUSSIAN SMOOTHING WHICH IS EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING SMALL NOISES. ADDITIONALLY, WE SET THE DILATION RATE OF THE GAUSSIAN SMOOTHING AS seven IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE BROAD CONTEXT OF IMAGES.
utt_0049 utt 349.15 363.78 -X NOW, LET ME TALK ABOUT THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF OUR WORK. WE ACHIEVED THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE OF FISHYSCAPES LOST AND FOUND DATASET. WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT OUR METHOD DOES NOT
utt_0051 utt 363.78 370.09 -X REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR EXTRA OD DATA WHICH WERE NECESSARY FOR MOST OF THE PREVIOUS METHODS.
utt_0052 utt 371.04 375.17 -X SUCH A RESULT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE FISHSCAPES LEADERBOARD.
utt_0053 utt 378.15 383.65 -X WE ALSO OUTPERFORMED THE BASELINE MODELS ON THE VALIDATION DATA SETS OF FISHYSCAPES
utt_0054 utt 383.84 390.31 -X AND THE ROAD ANOMALY, ANOTHER DATASET USED IN THIS FIELD.
utt_0055 utt 392.13 398.89 -X IN ADDITION TO THE QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION, WE CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF OUR WORK.
utt_0056 utt 399.71 403.40 -X FIRST, WE CONDUCTED AN ABLATION STUDY ON OUR MODULES.
utt_0057 utt 404.32 411.88 -X WE CONFIRMED THAT APPLYING SML OUTPERFORMS MAX LOGITS. ALSO, APPLYING BOTH THE ITERATIVE
utt_0058 utt 411.88 420.49 -X BOUNDARY SUPPRESSION AND DILATED SMOOTHING ON SML OUTPERFORMS APPLYING ONLY ONE OF THE TWO MODULES.
utt_0059 utt 420.49 425.91 -X SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SEGMENTATION PERFORMANCE ON CITYSCAPES VALIDATION SET
utt_0060 utt 425.96 438.92 -X AFTER DETECTING ANOMALOUS OBJECTS. WHILE MSP AND MAX LOGITS SUFFER FROM SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION IN THE SEGMENTATION PERFORMANCE AFTER DETECTING THE UNEXPECTED OBJECTS,
utt_0062 utt 439.49 442.60 -X OURS SHOWS ONLY A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE DROP.
utt_0063 utt 444.29 451.15 -X THIRD, OUR METHOD CAN BE APPLIED TO DIVERSE BACKBONES INCLUDING MOBILENET, SHUFFLENET, AND
utt_0064 utt 451.15 459.50 -X RESNETfifty. WE CONFIRMED THAT OUR METHOD IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE IN THE THREE DIFFERENT BACKBONES.
utt_0065 utt 460.61 474.51 -X FOURTH, OUR METHOD REQUIRES ONLY A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF COMPUTATION COSTS. SYNTHESIZE AND COMPARE IS AN APPROACH WHICH LEVERAGES AN IMAGE RESYNTHESIS MODEL TO DETECT ANOMALOUS OBJECTS.
utt_0067 utt 475.24 482.12 -X HOWEVER, IT REQUIRES A NON-TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF GFLOPS AND INFERENCE TIME. ON THE OTHER HAND,
utt_0068 utt 482.12 488.65 -X OUR METHOD SHOWS ONLY A MARGINAL INCREASE OF GFLOPS AND INFERENCE TIME COMPARED TO RESNET one hundred and one,
utt_0069 utt 488.68 503.18 -X THE BASELINE MODEL. LASTLY, WE ALSO CONFIRMED THAT APPLYING SML IS ESSENTIAL FOR APPLYING THE ITERATIVE BOUNDARY SUPPRESSION AND DILATED SMOOTHING. APPLYING THE ITERATIVE BOUNDARY
utt_0071 utt 503.18 507.98 -X SUPPRESSION AND DILATED SMOOTHING WITHOUT APPLYING SML AGGRAVATES THE PERFORMANCE.
utt_0072 utt 508.75 516.05 -X THIS TABLE seven EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STANDARDIZATION OF THE MAX LOGITS.
utt_0073 utt 517.19 523.12 -X THIS SLIDE VISUALIZES THE IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES WITH THE THRESHOLD OF THE TRUE POSITIVE RATE AT
utt_0074 utt 524.14 538.03 -X ninety-five PERCENT. THE WHITE PIXELS INDICATE ANOMALOUS OBJECTS. WE CAN SEE THAT MSL AND MAX LOGITS HAVE A NON-TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF FALSE POSITIVES, THOSE WHICH ARE IN-DISTRIBUTION PIXELS BUT COLORED
utt_0076 utt 538.03 547.04 -X WHITE. HOWEVER, OUR METHOD DECREASES THE FALSE POSITIVE PIXELS SIGNIFICANTLY. IN SUMMARY, SUCH
utt_0077 utt 547.04 554.86 -X EXTENSIVE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVALUATIONS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR METHOD.
utt_0078 utt 555.18 566.83 -X WE BELIEVE THAT OUR WORK INSPIRES FUTURE RESEARCHERS WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE OF METHODS WHICH ARE SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE TO DETECT ANOMALOUS OBJECTS IN URBAN-SCENE SEGMENTATION.
utt_0080 utt 566.83 570.48 -X THIS IS THE END OF OUR PRESENTATION. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN OUR WORK,
