utt_0000 utt 0.94 15.86 -X HELLO EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO THIS PRESENTATION MY NAME IS OMID MOHADDESI AND IN THIS PRESENTATION I WILL INTRODUCE GAMETTES A PLAYFUL APPROACH FOR CAPTURING DECISION-MAKING FOR INFORMING BEHAVIORAL MODELS THIS STUDY WAS PART OF AN NSF GRANT THAT WAS PERFORMED AT NORTHEASTERN
utt_0004 utt 15.86 28.34 -X UNIVERSITY WITH THE HELP OF MY CO-AUTHORS YIFAN SUN, RANA AZGHANDI, ROZHIN DOROUDI, SAM SNODGRASS, OZLEM ERGUN, JACQUELINE GRIFFIN, DAVID KAELI, STACY MARSELLA AND CASPER HARTEVELD
utt_0007 utt 28.34 36.27 -X WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHI two thousand and twenty ORGANIZERS FOR GIVING US AN HONORABLE MENTION AWARD AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR WORK DESPITE NOT HOLDING CHI two thousand and twenty
utt_0009 utt 36.33 38.45 -X CONFERENCE BECAUSE OF THE COVIDminus nineteen PANDEMIC
utt_0010 utt 39.50 53.91 -X IN THIS STUDY WE ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DECISION-MAKING PROCESS THIS IS OF COURSE OF INTEREST IN MANY DIFFERENT FIELDS AND MANY DIFFERENT METHODS ARE USED TO GET SUCH UNDERSTANDING SIMULATION IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE
utt_0014 utt 53.91 67.33 -X WIDELY USED TO ANALYZE AND MODEL HUMAN DECISION-MAKING AMONG DIFFERENT SIMULATION TECHNIQUES AGENT-BASED MODELING IS PRACTICAL WHEN WE ARE DEALING WITH HUMAN SYSTEMS AND TRY TO MODEL HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL
utt_0017 utt 67.33 78.69 -X INTERACTIONS BUT SINCE WE USUALLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNAL MECHANISMS THAT DERIVE HUMAN DECISIONS THESE ABMS USUALLY USE A HIGH LEVEL OF ABSTRACTIONS
utt_0019 utt 78.80 82.48 -X OR LACK BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS SUCH AS TRUST OR MENTAL MODELS
utt_0020 utt 82.83 87.48 -X THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO PUT THE HUMAN IN THE LOOP TO BE ABLE TO INFORM AGENT-BASED MODELS
utt_0022 utt 88.02 97.05 -X OF COURSE PUTTING HUMAN IN THE LOOP OF THE SIMULATION IS NOT A NEW TECHNIQUE AND IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE BODY OF RESEARCH CALLED PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES FOR SIMULATION
utt_0024 utt 97.23 107.93 -X MOST OF THE STUDIES IN THIS AREA FOCUS ON EITHER CREATING A SIMPLE INTERFACE TO INVOLVE HUMAN DECISION MAKER WITH PART OF THE SIMULATION OR CREATING A SERIOUS
utt_0026 utt 107.93 122.12 -X GAME FOR THE WHOLE SIMULATION PROCESS THE FIRST APPROACH DO NOT NECESSARILY CREATE AN AUTHENTIC AN IMMERSIVE DECISION-MAKING ENVIRONMENT AND CREATING A SIMULATION FOR THE WHOLE CREATING A SERIOUS GAME FOR THE WHOLE SIMULATION
utt_0029 utt 122.12 123.45 -X MAY REQUIRE A LOT OF RESOURCES
utt_0030 utt 124.79 135.67 -X WE PROPOSE THE USE OF GAMETTES WHICH ARE SHORT AND RELATIVELY SIMPLE GAMES THAT IMMERSE HUMAN PLAYERS IN A DECISION-MAKING SCENARIO THE TERM GAMETTES IS A CONTRACTION OF
utt_0034 utt 135.67 146.76 -X GAMES WITH VIGNETTES AND SIMILAR TO VIGNETTE A GAMETTE AIMS TO PROVIDE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF A SITUATION AS WELL AS TO PORTRAY SOMEONE IN OUR PREVIOUS
utt_0036 utt 146.76 159.96 -X STUDY WE DESIGNED AN INTEGRATED SIMULATION FRAMEWORK WHICH WAS MOTIVATED BY THE ROLE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN DISRUPTIONS WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLY CHAINS THAT LEADS TO DRUG SHORTAGES THIS FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF A FLOW SIMULATOR
utt_0039 utt 159.96 170.17 -X THAT SIMULATES THE DYNAMICS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND A GAMETTES ENVIRONMENT THAT IMMERSE HUMAN DECISION-MAKERS INTO A SPECIFIC ROLE AND A PARTICULAR STATE OF
utt_0041 utt 170.17 179.87 -X THE SUPPLY CHAIN THE FLOW SIMULATOR IS A MULTI AGENT SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT DESIGNED BASED ON PARTIALLY OBSERVABLE MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES OR POMDPS
utt_0045 utt 189.79 192.41 -X CAN TAKE SOME ACTIONS AND RECEIVE SOME REWARDS
utt_0046 utt 193.65 196.80 -X THE DESIGN OF THE GAMETTES FOLLOWS THE SAME IDEA
utt_0047 utt 196.89 207.93 -X OF THE POMDP FRAMEWORK BY ALLOWING PLAYERS TO COLLECT INFORMATION TAKE ACTIONS AND RECEIVE REWARDS IN THIS STUDY WE CONSIDERED A DRUG DELIVERY SUPPLY CHAIN AS A DECISION CONTEXT SO WE BASICALLY
utt_0051 utt 212.76 221.85 -X DEMAND BACKLOG AND SHIPMENTS DATA ACTION MAPS TO CHOOSING AN ORDER AMOUNT AND REWARDS HERE NEGATIVE REWARDS MAPS TO INVENTORY AND BACKLOG COST
utt_0053 utt 221.94 233.09 -X WE CREATED GAMETTES USING STUDYCRAFTER WHICH IS A PLAYFUL PLATFORM WHERE USERS CAN CREATE PLAY AND SHARE GAMIFIED PROJECTS FOR BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
utt_0056 utt 233.40 237.82 -X USING STUDYCRAFTER WE DESIGNED EACH GAMETTE CONSISTING OF FOUR PHASES
utt_0057 utt 237.88 249.98 -X THE FIRST PHASE IS THE BRIEFING WHERE THE PLAYERS ARE BEING INFORMED ABOUT THEIR GOAL AND THEIR TASK WITHIN THE GAME THE SECOND PHASE IS THE GAMEPLAY PHASE WHERE THE ACTUAL DECISION-MAKING HAPPENS AND THE PLAYERS CAN INTERACT WITH A
utt_0060 utt 249.98 258.46 -X LAPTOP COMPUTER TO OBSERVE INFORMATION AND MAKE DECISIONS AFTER THAT THE DEBRIEFING PHASE STARTS WHERE A NON-PLAYER CHARACTER DESCRIBES THE
utt_0062 utt 258.91 273.41 -X NATURE OF THE THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY AND PROVIDES SOME FEEDBACK ON PLAYERS PERFORMANCE AND LASTLY THERE IS A SURVEY WHERE WE CAN ASK QUESTION REGARDING THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLAYERS ABOUT THE CONTEXT OR ASKING SOME DEMOGRAPHICS
utt_0066 utt 274.20 286.93 -X NOW THE MAIN QUESTION IS THAT IF THIS IS A VALID METHODOLOGY FOR CAPTURING HUMAN DECISION-MAKING AND IF THE GAMETTE CAN PROVIDE RICH BEHAVIORAL DATA TO INFORM AGENT BASED MODELS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION WE
utt_0069 utt 286.93 300.61 -X CONDUCTED A HUMAN SUBJECT EXPERIMENT USING THE BEER DISTRIBUTION GAME THE BEER GAME IS SUITABLE FOR STUDYING BEHAVIORAL FACTORS IN SUPPLY CHAINS BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO BE LEARNED QUICKLY AND AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN
utt_0072 utt 300.61 308.58 -X RETAIN KEY FEATURES OF THE REAL SUPPLY CHAIN WE JUST CHANGED THE CONTEXT TO DRUG DELIVERY SUPPLY CHAIN TO STAY IN LINE WITH OUR PREVIOUS STUDY
utt_0074 utt 309.18 321.03 -X MOVING FORWARD WE HAD THREE HYPOTHESES THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS IS RELATED TO A PHENOMENON CALLED THE BULLWHIP EFFECT WHICH IS DEFINED AS THE AMPLIFICATION OF ORDER AMOUNTS WHEN MOVING UP IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
utt_0077 utt 321.31 335.46 -X PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SUPPLY CHAINS HAS SHOWN THAT THIS BEHAVIOR HAPPENS BECAUSE OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE INVENTORY AND DEMAND INFORMATION AND BECAUSE THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY OBSERVED IN SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERIMENTS AND
utt_0080 utt 335.46 340.26 -X ESPECIALLY WITH THE BEER GAME STUDIES DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS TRY TO VALIDATE
utt_0081 utt 340.42 354.98 -X THEIR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS BY SHOWING THE EVIDENCE OF THE BULLWHIP EFFECT WE ALSO DID THE SAME BY FORMING OUR FIRST HYPOTHESIS BY LOOKING FOR THE EVIDENCE OF BULLWHIP EFFECT TO TEST THE VALIDITY OF USING GAMETTES IN
utt_0084 utt 354.98 356.16 -X SUPPLY CHAIN DECISION MAKING
utt_0085 utt 356.93 365.49 -X PREVIOUS STUDIES ALSO SHOWED THAT THIS BULLWHIP EFFECT IS CAUSED BY JUDGMENTAL BIASES THAT NOT ONLY ORDINARY PEOPLE BUT ALSO
utt_0087 utt 365.95 376.20 -X PROFESSIONALS AND EXPERTS SUFFER FROM AS A RESULT IF THE BULLWHIP EFFECT EXISTS WE EXPECT TO SEE SIMILAR BEHAVIOR REGARDLESS IF PLAYERS INTERACT WITH
utt_0089 utt 376.39 386.74 -X RATIONAL AND OPTIMAL OR IRRATIONAL AGENTS AS LONG AS THE PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT BEING INFORMED ABOUT DIFFERENT AGENT TYPES AND FINALLY PREVIOUS STUDIES ALSO
utt_0091 utt 387.43 401.53 -X USED ANCHORING AND ADJUSTMENT HEURISTICS TO MODEL HUMAN DECISION-MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY AND SHOWED THAT PEOPLE OFTEN MAKE DECISIONS BY STARTING FROM AN INITIAL VALUE AND THEN ADJUSTING THAT TO MAKE A FINAL DECISION
utt_0094 utt 401.86 415.64 -X IF THIS FINAL DECISION IS SUGGESTED TO THE DECISION-MAKER THEIR ADJUSTMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE BIASED TOWARDS THAT SUGGESTED ANCHOR SO WE EXPECT TO SEE THIS ANCHORING IN PLAYERS' BEHAVIOR WHEN WE PROVIDE THEM WITH OPTIMAL ORDER
utt_0097 utt 415.64 425.43 -X SUGGESTIONS ACCORDING TO AN OPTIMAL ORDERING POLICY IN FACT WE WANT TO SEE IF THE GAMETTES AS A METHODOLOGY CAN CAPTURE THESE BIASES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PLAYERS
utt_0100 utt 426.21 438.74 -X FOR OUR EXPERIMENT WE CONSIDERED THREE CONDITIONS WHERE WE CREATED A GAMETTE FOR THE WHOLESALER ROLE AND CONSIDERED HUMAN PLAYERS TO BE PLAYING ONLY THIS ROLE WE DID THIS BECAUSE WITH THE WHOLESALER WE CAN
utt_0103 utt 438.74 450.73 -X DIRECTLY OBSERVE THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE BULLWHIP EFFECT AND TEST THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS FOR TESTING THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS WE CONSIDERED A VARIATION BY CONSIDERING TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGENTS A HUMAN-LIKE AGENT THAT TRY TO
utt_0106 utt 450.73 464.49 -X MIMIC HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND AN ORDER-UP-TO-LEVEL AGENT THAT TRIES TO ORDER OPTIMAL AMOUNTS ACCORDING TO A BASIC STOCK POLICY AND FINALLY FOR THE THIRD HYPOTHESIS WE CONSIDERED DIFFERENT VARIATIONS WHERE WE EITHER PROVIDE OR
utt_0109 utt 464.49 477.96 -X DO NOT PROVIDE OPTIMAL ORDER SUGGESTIONS TO PLAYERS AND THIS IS HOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE LEFT IMAGE SHOWS THE ORDERING SCENE IN GAMETTES WHERE PLAYERS DON'T GET ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS WHERE IN THE RIGHT IMAGE WHICH PERTAINS TO CONDITION THREE
utt_0112 utt 478.09 483.96 -X PLAYERS WERE RECEIVING SUGGESTIONS IN FORM OF OPTIMAL ORDER AMOUNT BASED ON
utt_0113 utt 484.97 486.41 -X ORDER-UP-TO-LEVEL POLICY
utt_0114 utt 486.73 498.41 -X THE DEMAND DISTRIBUTION WAS THE SAME IN ALL THREE CONDITIONS AND FOLLOWED THE BEER GAME SETTING WE JUST MADE A MINOR CHANGE TO ADAPT IT TO OUR DRUG DELIVERY CONTEXT WE USED CONSTANT DEMAND OF forty
utt_0117 utt 498.41 503.79 -X UNITS UP TO WEEK FOUR AND CONSTANT DEMAND OF eighty UNITS AFTER THAT WE HAD sixty-eight
utt_0118 utt 503.88 514.19 -X PARTICIPANTS EACH WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE CONDITIONS AMONG THEM THERE WERE thirty-seven MALES ten FEMALES AND twenty-one PARTICIPANTS WHO DIDN'T REVEAL THEIR
utt_0120 utt 514.19 520.53 -X GENDER THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS twenty-three YEARS OLD WITH AN STANDARD DEVIATION OF TWO AND A HALF YEARS
utt_0122 utt 521.10 527.60 -X WE FIRST LOOKED AT THE EVIDENCE OF THE BULLWHIP EFFECT IN CONDITION one AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE BULLWHIP EFFECT IS VISIBLE
utt_0124 utt 527.69 531.76 -X WITH AN INCREASE IN ORDER QUANTITIES MOVING UP IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
utt_0125 utt 532.30 542.53 -X FROM THE HEALTH CENTER TO THE MANUFACTURER BUT SINCE THE PLAYERS ONLY PLAYED THE WHOLESALER AND THE REST OF THE AGENTS WERE COMPUTER AGENTS WE ALSO
utt_0127 utt 542.53 553.65 -X CALCULATED THE BULLWHIP EFFECT INDEX WHICH IS THE RATIO OF ORDER FLUCTUATIONS OVER DEMAND FLUCTUATIONS AT EACH NODE OR FOR EACH AGENT BASICALLY WE CAN OBSERVE
utt_0129 utt 553.65 558.32 -X THAT HUMAN-LIKE AGENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BULLWHIP EFFECT BY
utt_0130 utt 558.70 569.94 -X SHOWING FLUCTUATIONS HUMAN PLAYERS HOWEVER SHOW EVEN MORE FLUCTUATIONS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE BULLWHIP EFFECT MORE THAN HUMAN-LIKE AGENTS NEXT WE COMPARED
utt_0132 utt 570.73 579.98 -X THE ORDERING BEHAVIOR OF HUMAN PLAYERS IN ALL CONDITIONS WE CAN SEE THAT THE HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF AGENTS IN FACT PRESENCE OF
utt_0134 utt 580.30 593.86 -X DIFFERENT TYPE OF AGENTS DIDN'T HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON THE ORDERING BEHAVIOR OF PLAYERS WE ALSO PERFORMED A ONE-WAY ANOVA FOR EACH TIME STEP AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEANS OF ORDER
utt_0137 utt 593.86 598.19 -X AMOUNTS OF PLAYERS IN DIFFERENT CONDITIONS WHICH SUPPORTS THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS
utt_0138 utt 599.18 609.49 -X FINALLY BY LOOKING AGAIN AT THE SAME GRAPH WE CAN SEE THAT PROVIDING ORDER SUGGESTIONS TO PLAYERS IN CONDITION three DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON
utt_0140 utt 609.49 619.89 -X THEIR ORDERING BEHAVIOR WHICH CONTRADICTS OUR THIRD HYPOTHESIS HOWEVER AN INTERESTING FINDING IS THE DEVIATION FROM SUGGESTED ORDER AMOUNTS HERE THE ERROR
utt_0142 utt 619.89 631.54 -X BARS SHOW HOW MUCH ON AVERAGE EACH PLAYER HOW MUCH AN AVERAGE PLAYERS DEVIATED FROM THE ORDER SUGGESTIONS AND AS YOU CAN SEE PLAYERS TEND TO OVER
utt_0144 utt 631.54 645.84 -X ORDER AT ALMOST ALL TIME PERIODS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY AROUND WEEK six WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THE CHANGE IN THE DEMAND AND FACED A STOCK OUT THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE RESULTS OF THE BULLWHIP EFFECT STATING THAT HUMAN DECISION-MAKERS START
utt_0147 utt 645.84 648.40 -X TO OVER ORDER WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE A STOCK OUT
utt_0148 utt 649.84 664.21 -X NOW THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WE NEED GAMETTES BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY SIMULATION GAMES OUT THERE THAT USE AGENT BASED PARTICIPATORY FRAMEWORK TO PUT THE HUMAN IN THE LOOP OF THE SIMULATION PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWED THAT WHEN HUMAN PARTICIPANTS HAVE ACCESS TO
utt_0152 utt 664.21 678.20 -X ALL ASPECTS OF THE SIMULATION THIS CAN MAKE THE PROCESS UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED AND THIS SHOWS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ACCURACY OF THE SIMULATION AND PLAYER IMMERSION AND SUGGESTS TO AVOID DETAILS THAT HAVE LESS
utt_0155 utt 678.20 691.41 -X IMPACT ON THE DECISIONS ALTHOUGH WE CAN FINE-TUNE THIS TRADE-OFF BETWEEN ACCURACY AND PLAYER IMMERSION THROUGH ITERATION GAMETTES ACTUALLY MANAGE THESE COMPLEXITIES METHODOLOGICALLY BY PORTRAYING ONLY A SHORT AND SPECIFIC
utt_0158 utt 691.41 696.76 -X SCENARIO FOR A SPECIFIC ROLE IN THIS WAY WE CAN MAKE ACCURATE MODELS AND IMMERSE
utt_0159 utt 697.72 704.79 -X PLAYERS INTO SPECIFIC SCENARIOS WITHOUT OVERWHELMING THEM WITH EXCESSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF THE SIMULATION
utt_0161 utt 704.98 717.62 -X FINALLY WE DESIGNED GAMETTES FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF SERIOUS GAMES AND CROWDSOURCING IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THE AFFORDANCES OF PLAYER IMMERSION ACCESS TO RICH BEHAVIOR OF DATA AND ENGAGING A BROADER AUDIENCE
utt_0164 utt 717.81 732.31 -X PREVIOUS STUDIES ALSO SUGGEST THAT USE OF SERIOUS GAMES IN AGENT-BASED SIMULATION HELPS IN BUILDING MORE INTUITIVE AND INTERACTIVE SIMULATION ENVIRONMENTS WE VALIDATED THE USE OF GAMETTES BY SHOWING THE EVIDENCE OF THE
utt_0167 utt 732.31 742.27 -X BULLWHIP EFFECT IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO OBSERVED THAT PARTICIPANTS AMPLIFY THEIR ORDERS EVEN MORE THAN HUMAN-LIKE AGENTS IN OUR SIMULATION THIS SHOWS THAT
utt_0169 utt 742.27 748.47 -X GAMETTES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE RICH BEHAVIORAL DATA TO INFORM SIMULATION AGENTS
utt_0170 utt 748.60 757.79 -X IN THIS STUDY WE DIDN'T LOOK AT HOW TO INFORM SIMULATION AGENTS IN PRACTICE USING THE COLLECTED DATA BUT WE LOOKED AT THIS
utt_0172 utt 758.10 772.72 -X IN OUR CHI two thousand and twenty LATE-BREAKING WORK PAPER WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE IN THE ACM DIGITAL LIBRARY IN THIS LATE-BREAKING WORK PAPER WE SHOW HOW TO PRACTICALLY USE THE COLLECTED DATA FROM THE GAMETTES TO IMITATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND INFORM
utt_0175 utt 772.72 782.56 -X AGENT BASED MODELS YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS PAPER BY FOLLOWING THIS LINK NOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN USING GAMETTES AND APPLYING IT TO YOUR RESEARCH YOU CAN DO
utt_0177 utt 783.64 797.16 -X THIS BY FIRST FINDING A MAPPING BETWEEN YOUR SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT AND A GAMETTE DESIGN IN OUR CASE WE USED THE POMDP FRAMEWORK TO MAP THE GAMETTE TO THE SIMULATION NEXT YOU NEED TO SLICE YOUR SIMULATION
utt_0180 utt 797.16 806.43 -X INTO A SHORT AND SPECIFIC DECISION CONTEXT THAT CONSISTS OF THE ELEMENTS OF YOUR MAPPING FOR EXAMPLE THE INFORMATION, ACTIONS, AND REWARDS
utt_0182 utt 806.55 812.06 -X FOR CREATING GAMETTES YOU CAN USE THE STUDYCRAFTER THE SAME AS WE DID
