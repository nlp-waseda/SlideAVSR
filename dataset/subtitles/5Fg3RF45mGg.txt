utt_0000 utt 0.08 4.21 -X WE INTRODUCE DECOR-GAN, A DEEP GENERATIVE MODEL FOR threeD SHAPE DETAILIZATION.
utt_0001 utt 5.36 11.38 -X OUR WORK IS INSPIRED BY A SERIES OF RECENT ADVANCES IN threeD GENERATIVE MODELS.
utt_0002 utt 11.38 16.72 -X IDEALLY, WE WANT THE NETWORKS TO GENERATE REALISTIC SHAPES WITH RICH LOCAL DETAILS,
utt_0003 utt 16.72 18.13 -X AS SHOWN ON THE LEFT.
utt_0004 utt 18.64 23.76 -X HOWEVER, MOST OF THE CURRENT GENERATIVE MODELS CAN ONLY GENERATE COARSE VOXELS,
utt_0005 utt 23.76 26.10 -X SPARSE POINT CLOUDS, OR SMOOTH NEURAL IMPLICITS.
utt_0006 utt 26.70 30.74 -X NONE OF THEM IS ABLE TO SYNTHESIZE GEOMETRIC DETAILS.
utt_0007 utt 30.74 32.88 -X THEREFORE, WE SEEK TO ANSWER THE QUESTION:
utt_0008 utt 32.91 37.78 -X CAN WE GET FINER GEOMETRIC DETAILS WITH threeD GENERATIVE MODELS?
utt_0009 utt 37.78 42.99 -X ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT HIGH-QUALITY DETAILED SHAPES ARE USUALLY SCARCE AND HARD TO OBTAIN.
utt_0010 utt 42.99 47.59 -X WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE LARGE VARIETIES OF HIGH-RESOLUTION AND DETAILED threeD GEOMETRIES
utt_0011 utt 47.69 50.71 -X FROM ONLY A SMALL SET OF DETAILED threeD EXEMPLARS,
utt_0012 utt 51.15 56.12 -X WHICH MOTIVATES US TO POSE THE NOVEL PROBLEM OF threeD SHAPE DETAILIZATION.
utt_0013 utt 56.12 59.09 -X WE TREAT THE PROBLEM AS THAT OF GEOMETRIC DETAIL TRANSFER.
utt_0014 utt 59.57 65.27 -X GIVEN A LOW-RESOLUTION COARSE VOXEL SHAPE, OUR NETWORK REFINES IT, VIA VOXEL UPSAMPLING,
utt_0015 utt 65.27 69.40 -X INTO A HIGHER-RESOLUTION SHAPE ENRICHED WITH GEOMETRIC DETAILS.
utt_0016 utt 69.40 73.46 -X THE OUTPUT SHAPE PRESERVES THE OVERALL STRUCTURE, OR CONTENT, OF THE INPUT,
utt_0017 utt 73.65 79.76 -X WHILE ITS DETAIL GENERATION IS CONDITIONED ON AN INPUT STYLE CODE, CORRESPONDING TO A DETAILED EXEMPLAR.
utt_0018 utt 81.14 85.49 -X OUR NETWORK IS TRAINED WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF DETAILED SHAPES IN HIGH RESOLUTION,
utt_0019 utt 85.71 90.04 -X AND A RELATIVELY LARGE AMOUNT OF COARSE SHAPES IN LOW RESOLUTION.
utt_0020 utt 90.04 92.28 -X TO CONTROL THE STYLE OF THE GENERATED DETAILS,
utt_0021 utt 92.53 96.66 -X WE INTRODUCE A LEARNABLE LATENT CODE Z_S FOR EACH DETAILED SHAPE S.
utt_0022 utt 97.14 102.26 -X THE GOAL OF OUR NETWORK IS TO UPSAMPLE THE INPUT COARSE SHAPE INTO A DETAILED SHAPE,
utt_0023 utt 102.26 105.97 -X WITH RESPECT TO THE STYLE SPECIFIED BY THE INPUT LATENT CODE.
utt_0024 utt 105.97 112.18 -X THEREFORE, FOR DETAILED SHAPE S, WE COULD DIRECTLY APPLY SUPERVISED TRAINING VIA RECONSTRUCTION.
utt_0025 utt 112.18 115.99 -X FIRST, WE DOWNSAMPLE THE DETAILED SHAPE S INTO A COARSE SHAPE.
utt_0026 utt 115.99 123.73 -X THEN WE FEED THE DOWNSAMPLED COARSE SHAPE INTO THE GENERATOR NETWORK, TOGETHER WITH THE LATENT CODE Z_S , TO UPSAMPLE IT INTO A HIGH-RESOLUTION SHAPE.
utt_0028 utt 123.79 129.62 -X TO FOCUS THE CAPACITY OF THE GENERATOR NETWORK ON THE REGION THAT THE OUTPUT SHAPE IS LIKELY TO OCCUPY,
utt_0029 utt 129.72 134.49 -X WE COMPUTE A GENERATOR MASK, BY DILATING AND UPSAMPLING THE COARSE SHAPE.
utt_0030 utt 134.49 138.87 -X THEN WE APPLY THE GENERATOR MASK TO THE GENERATOR OUTPUT TO OBTAIN OUR FINAL OUTPUT,
utt_0031 utt 138.87 144.76 -X WHICH IS TRAINED WITH A RECONSTRUCTION LOSS TO MAKE IT AS SIMILAR TO THE DETAILED SHAPE S AS POSSIBLE.
utt_0032 utt 144.76 151.32 -X FOR AN INPUT COARSE SHAPE C THAT IS NOT DERIVED FROM A DETAILED SHAPE, WE CAN PERFORM THE SAME OPERATIONS.
utt_0033 utt 151.32 155.38 -X WE FEED THE COARSE SHAPE AND THE LATENT CODE INTO THE GENERATOR NETWORK FOR UPSAMPLING,
utt_0034 utt 155.54 160.38 -X AND THEN WE APPLY THE GENERATOR MASK TO OBTAIN THE FINAL OUTPUT.
utt_0035 utt 160.38 166.87 -X HOWEVER, SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A GROUND TRUTH DETAILED SHAPE THAT COMBINES THE CONTENT OF THE COARSE SHAPE C AND THE STYLE OF SHAPE S,
utt_0037 utt 167.25 170.46 -X WE CANNOT DIRECTLY USE THE RECONSTRUCTION LOSS.
utt_0038 utt 170.46 172.67 -X THEREFORE, WE APPLY ADVERSARIAL TRAINING,
utt_0039 utt 172.67 177.43 -X AND USE A PATCHGAN DISCRIMINATOR TO DISTINGUISH REAL AND FAKE LOCAL PATCHES.
utt_0040 utt 177.43 184.99 -X THE GLOBAL DISCRIMINATOR, D_G, ENSURES THAT ALL LOCAL PATCHES IN THE GENERATED SHAPE ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE TRAINING DETAILED SHAPES.
utt_0042 utt 184.99 192.89 -X THE STYLE-SPECIFIC DISCRIMINATOR, D_S, ENCOURAGES THE LOCAL PATCHES IN THE GENERATED SHAPE TO BE SIMILAR TO THE SPECIFIC DETAILED SHAPE S,
utt_0044 utt 192.89 195.21 -X SO THAT THE OUTPUT SHAPE HAS A SIMILAR LOCAL STYLE WITH S.
utt_0045 utt 195.99 203.71 -X SIMILAR TO THE GENERATOR MASKS, WE ALSO APPLY DISCRIMINATOR MASKS TO FOCUS THE CAPACITY OF THE DISCRIMINATOR ON THE OCCUPIED REGIONS.
utt_0047 utt 203.71 207.61 -X EVENTUALLY, WE COMPUTE THE LOSSES TO TRAIN THE DISCRIMINATOR, AND THE GENERATOR.
utt_0050 utt 218.88 278.40 -X AND THE DETAILED SHAPES CORRESPONDING TO THE STYLE CODES ARE SHOWN ON TOP, IN GREEN.
utt_0055 utt 296.03 298.50 -X THE CODE AND DATA OF OUR WORK IS AVAILABLE ON GITHUB.
utt_0056 utt 298.56 300.00 -3.1214 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING!
