utt_0000 utt 0.68 8.46 -X HI, I AM PHILIPP LINDENBERGER AND IN THIS VIDEO I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT OUR PAPER PIXEL-PERFECT STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION WITH FEATUREMETRIC REFINEMENT.
utt_0002 utt 8.97 16.69 -X THIS IS A JOINT WORK WITH PAUL-EDOUARD SARLIN, VIKTOR LARSSON, AND MARC POLLEFEYS AT THE COMPUTER VISION AND GEOMETRY GROUP AT ETH ZURICH.
utt_0004 utt 17.45 23.44 -X IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO IMPROVE SPARSE STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION BY ALIGNING DEEP FEATURES ACROSS MULTIPLE VIEWS.
utt_0006 utt 24.20 28.53 -X THIS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF threeD POINTS AND CAMERA POSES,
utt_0007 utt 28.65 31.38 -X YIELDING SUBPIXEL-ACCURATE RECONSTRUCTIONS,
utt_0008 utt 31.38 35.41 -X AND SCALES TO THOUSANDS OF IMAGES WITH ONLY A SMALL OVERHEAD.
utt_0009 utt 35.63 44.88 -X STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION TAKES AN UNSTRUCTURED SET OF IMAGES CAPTURED FROM VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS AND ILLUMINATION CONDITIONS, RECOVERS THE CAMERA POSES, AND RECONSTRUCTS
utt_0011 utt 45.07 48.11 -X A SPARSE threeD POINT CLOUD OF THE OBSERVED SCENE.
utt_0012 utt 48.11 50.64 -X LETâ€™S FIRST REVIEW HOW THIS WORKS.
utt_0013 utt 50.64 55.31 -X A TYPICAL SFM PIPELINE LIKE COLMAP STARTS BY DETECTING INTEREST POINTS IN EACH IMAGE,
utt_0014 utt 56.08 59.09 -X USUALLY LOCATED ON DISTINCTIVE STRUCTURES SUCH AS CORNERS.
utt_0015 utt 59.41 62.55 -X THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED FOR ALL IMAGES IN THE SCENE,
utt_0021 utt 79.50 84.15 -X USING EPIPOLAR GEOMETRY, INVALID MATCHES CAN BE FILTERED AT AN EARLY STAGE.
utt_0022 utt 84.15 88.76 -X THE MATCHING GRAPH CAN BE CONSTRUCTED BY MATCHING OTHER IMAGES IN THE SCENE,
utt_0023 utt 88.91 92.88 -X AND MATCHES ACROSS MULTIPLE VIEWS ARE CALLED TRACKS.
utt_0024 utt 92.88 96.44 -X IN A NEXT STEP, TRACKS ARE TRIANGULATED TO OBTAIN threeD POINTS,
utt_0025 utt 96.44 99.54 -X AND THIS PROCESS IS REPEATED FOR EACH TRACK IN THE MATCHES GRAPH.
utt_0026 utt 101.46 109.78 -X BOTH threeD STRUCTURE AND CAMERA POSES ARE REFINED BY MINIMIZING THE twoD REPROJECTION ERROR IN A GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM CALLED BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT.
utt_0028 utt 109.94 114.80 -X WHILE THE SFM PIPELINE IS ROBUST, IT OFTEN YIELDS NOISY threeD POINT CLOUDS.
utt_0029 utt 114.80 117.08 -X LETS HAVE A LOOK AT WHY THIS HAPPENS IN A GIVEN TRACK.
utt_0030 utt 117.74 121.68 -X KEYPOINTS ARE DETECTED FOR EACH IMAGE SEPARATELY AND NEED TO BE MATCHED GLOBALLY,
utt_0031 utt 122.00 125.11 -X THUS THEY ARE NOT PERFECTLY ALIGNED OVER MULTIPLE VIEWS.
utt_0032 utt 125.94 129.01 -X THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED IN RECENT LEARNED FEATURE DETECTORS,
utt_0033 utt 129.07 133.33 -X WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENCODE GLOBAL CONTEXT AT A LOWER RESOLUTION.
utt_0034 utt 133.33 137.14 -X THIS NOISE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF THE RESULTING threeD MODEL,
utt_0035 utt 137.14 142.90 -X BECAUSE THE STANDARD SFM PIPELINES APPLIES BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT WITH A GEOMETRIC REPROJECTION ERROR.
utt_0036 utt 143.19 153.14 -X HERE, THE twoD PROJECTION OF A threeD POINT IN ITS OBSERVING IMAGE IS COMPARED TO THE NOISY LOCATION OF ITS CORRESPONDING DETECTION AND THEIR twoD DISTANCE IS MINIMIZED.
utt_0038 utt 153.14 157.21 -X NOISY INITIAL DETECTIONS WILL THEREFORE PROPAGATE THROUGH THE ENTIRE SFM PIPELINE
utt_0039 utt 157.27 161.30 -X AND RESULT IN NOISY threeD POINTS AND CAMERA POSES.
utt_0040 utt 161.30 166.81 -X BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF IMAGES WHICH OBSERVE THE SAME threeD POINT, THIS ERROR CAN BE REDUCED.
utt_0041 utt 166.81 171.09 -X THOUGH, IN MANY CASES, THIS IS INFEASIBLE SINCE IT REQUIRES A LARGE VIEW OVERLAP.
utt_0042 utt 171.51 176.34 -X SCALING SFM TO LARGE SCENES ON THE OTHER HAND IS MADE EASIER IF FEW OBSERVATIONS ARE REDUNDANT.
utt_0043 utt 177.46 181.97 -X NOISY KEYPOINTS ALSO IMPACT SUBSEQUENT TASKS SUCH AS CAMERA RE-LOCALIZATION,
utt_0044 utt 181.97 186.78 -X WHERE WE ESTIMATE THE six-DOF POSE OF AN UNKNOWN IMAGE WITH RESPECT TO AN EXISTING threeD MODEL.
utt_0045 utt 187.70 192.34 -X DETECTIONS IN THE QUERY IMAGE WHICH ARE JUST A FEW PIXELS OFF CAN RESULT IN LARGE POSE ERRORS.
utt_0046 utt 192.85 195.90 -X THE SAME APPLIES TO NOISY threeD MODELS.
utt_0047 utt 195.90 204.02 -X TO IMPROVE RECONSTRUCTIONS, RECENT METHODS LIKE PATCH FLOW AIM TO REFINE THE INITIAL DETECTIONS BY ESTIMATING THE FLOW OF LOCAL IMAGE PATCHES.
utt_0049 utt 204.02 210.55 -X WHILE THIS HAS SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ACCURATE, IT REQUIRES EXPENSIVE FLOW PREDICTIONS FOR EACH IMAGE PAIR.
utt_0051 utt 211.64 223.22 -X PHOTOMETRIC BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT USES APPEARANCE INFORMATION TO REFINE THE threeD MODEL AFTER SFM BY MINIMIZING THE APPEARANCE DIFFERENCE OF LOCAL PATCHES BUT FAILS UNDER LARGE ILLUMINATION CHANGES SUCH AS DAY-NIGHT IMAGES.
utt_0054 utt 224.02 230.62 -X WE PROPOSE PIXEL-PERFECT STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION WHICH IMPROVES BOTH INITIAL DETECTIONS PRIOR TO SFM AND THE FINAL threeD SCENE.
utt_0056 utt 231.73 239.26 -X WE START BY FEEDING EACH IMAGE THROUGH A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK TO OBTAIN DENSE, HIGH DIMENSIONAL FEATURE MAPS.
utt_0058 utt 239.26 249.24 -X IN FEATUREMETRIC KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT, WE ALIGN DEEP FEATURES ON THE TENTATIVE MATCHES GRAPH TO REFINE INITIAL DETECTIONS JOINTLY OVER MULTIPLE VIEWS BY DIRECT OPTIMIZATION.
utt_0060 utt 249.62 256.03 -X THE REFINED KEYPOINTS ARE FOWARDED TO THE STANDARD SFM PIPELINE TO ESTIMATE A threeD RECONSTRUCTION.
utt_0062 utt 256.18 263.35 -X IN FEATURE-METRIC BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT, WE PROPOSE TO REFINE BOTH POSES AND threeD STRUCTURE GLOBALLY USING THE SAME DEEP FEATURES.
utt_0064 utt 264.05 269.21 -X THIS DIRECT OPTIMIZATION PIPELINE IMPROVES BOTH ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF threeD MODELS.
utt_0065 utt 270.61 278.87 -X THE SYSTEM REQUIRES DEEP FEATURES WHICH ARE BOTH ROBUST TO ILLUMINATION CHANGES AND ENCODE LOCAL APPEARANCE INFORMATION IN HIGH RESOLUTION.
utt_0067 utt 278.87 283.87 -X WITH LOCALLY SMOOTH AND ACCURATE FEATUREMETRIC COST FUNCTIONS AROUND MATCHED DETECTIONS,
utt_0068 utt 284.05 288.06 -X EVEN COARSE PRIORS CAN CONVERGE ACCURATELY.
utt_0069 utt 288.50 292.70 -X THE NEXT STEP IS KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT, WHERE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACH IS PATCH FLOW.
utt_0070 utt 293.14 296.78 -X IT ESTIMATES A FLOW FIELD BETWEEN MATCHED IMAGE PATCHES USING A CNN
utt_0071 utt 297.11 300.64 -X AND COMPARES THE FLOW -ADJUSTED KEYPOINT TO ITS MATCHED CORRESPONDENCE ,
utt_0072 utt 300.76 303.52 -X MINIMIZING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN twoD POINTS.
utt_0073 utt 303.83 307.13 -X THIS OPTIMIZATION HAS A QUADRATIC COMPLEXITY IN THE FLOW T.
utt_0074 utt 308.50 315.39 -X OUR FEATUREMETRIC KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT DIRECTLY MINIMIZES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERPOLATED DESCRIPTORS AT KEYPOINT LOCATIONS.
utt_0076 utt 315.58 317.40 -X IN CONTRAST TO PATCH FLOW,
utt_0077 utt 317.40 320.83 -X THE GRADIENTS IN THE DEEP FEATURES IMPLICITLY DEFINE A FLOW FIELD,
utt_0078 utt 320.95 324.06 -X AND WE THEREFORE ONLY NEED ONE FORWARD PASS FOR EACH IMAGE.
utt_0079 utt 324.70 328.12 -X IN PRACTICE, WE TAKE THE KEYPOINTS OF A MATCHED TRACK,
utt_0080 utt 328.12 330.84 -X AND BUILD A GRAPH WITH EDGES WEIGHTED BY THE MATCHING SCORE.
utt_0081 utt 331.29 341.60 -X THE GRAPH IS THEN OPTIMIZED BY MINIMIZING THE FEATUREMETRIC ERROR ALONG EACH EDGE AND WE FIX THE KEYPOINT WITH THE HIGHEST AGGREGATED MATCHING SCORE TO AVOID DRIFT.
utt_0083 utt 341.60 347.04 -X FEATUREMETRIC KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT RESULTS IN BETTER-LOCALIZED FEATURES ACROSS MULTIPLE VIEWS,
utt_0084 utt 347.04 354.75 -X EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE NOISE OF KEYPOINT DETECTORS, AND INCREASES BOTH THE TRACK LENGTH AND OVERALL NUMBER OF TRIANGULATED POINTS IN THE RECONSTRUCTED MODEL.
utt_0086 utt 356.31 361.31 -X REFINED KEYPOINTS CAN ALSO EFFECTIVELY INCREASE THE TRACK LENGTH OF TRIANGULATED POINTS.
utt_0087 utt 361.88 365.85 -X HERE WE HAVE A TRACK WHERE ALL FOUR FEATURES ARE MATCHED TOGETHER,
utt_0088 utt 365.98 375.77 -X BUT BECAUSE OF NOISY KEYPOINTS, COLMAP FAILS TO MERGE POINTS DURING TRIANGULATION AND INSTEAD CREATES TWO SEPARATE SMALLER TRACKS WITH LARGE REPROJECTION ERROR.
utt_0090 utt 376.79 381.92 -X FEATUREMETRIC KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT REDUCES THIS DETECTION NOISE BY OPTIMIZING THE GRAPH JOINTLY,
utt_0091 utt 381.98 390.14 -X AND COLMAP IS THEN ABLE TO CORRECTLY TRIANGULATE THE MATCHES TO A SINGLE, MORE ROBUST threeD POINT WITH LARGER TRACK LENGTH AND SMALLER REPROJECTION ERROR.
utt_0093 utt 391.32 394.05 -X THE SECOND PROPOSED REFINEMENT IS IN BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT.
utt_0094 utt 394.68 404.00 -X IN CLASSICAL SFM, ONE USUALLY MINIMIZES THE GEOMETRIC REPROJECTION ERROR BETWEEN THE PROJECTION OF A threeD POINT IN AN IMAGE AND THE CORRESPONDING KEYPOINT LOCATION.
utt_0096 utt 404.00 409.09 -X WHILE THIS GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT IS ROBUST TO OUTLIERS, IT DOES NOT USE ANY APPEARANCE INFORMATION.
utt_0097 utt 409.09 417.57 -X IN CONTRAST, FEATUREMETRIC BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT INTERPOLATES DEEP FEATURE MAPS AT THE threeD POINT PROJECTION AND COMPARES IT TO A FIXED REFERENCE.
utt_0099 utt 417.57 422.21 -X BOTH POSES AND threeD POINTS ARE GLOBALLY ADJUSTED TO MINIMIZE THE FEATUREMETRIC ERROR.
utt_0100 utt 422.21 427.71 -X THIS DIRECT OPTIMIZATION USES ROBUST APPEARANCE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE DEEP FEATURES.
utt_0101 utt 427.71 434.05 -X IT TAKES AS INPUT A SPARSE threeD RECONSTRUCTION OBTAINED FROM STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION.
utt_0102 utt 434.05 444.64 -X TO ESTIMATE A REFERENCE DESCRIPTOR FOR EACH TRACK, WE FIRST INTERPOLATE THE FEATURE MAPS AT THE CURRENT REPROJECTION LOCATIONS AND COMPUTE THEIR ROBUST MEAN USING ITERATIVE REWEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES.
utt_0105 utt 445.15 452.64 -X THE INTERPOLATED DESCRIPTOR MOST SIMILAR TO THE ROBUST MEAN IS SELECTED AS THE REFERENCE FOR THIS TRACK AND REMAINS FIXED DURING OPTIMIZATION.
utt_0107 utt 452.64 461.92 -X THE LOCAL, FEATURE-METRIC GRADIENT AT REPROJECTED LOCATIONS TOWARDS THE ROBUST REFERENCE ALLOWS TO GLOBALLY REFINE BOTH threeD STRUCTURE AND CAMERA POSES.
utt_0109 utt 461.95 471.55 -X THIS RESULTS IN A SUBPIXEL ACCURATE threeD MODEL, WHILE THE PIPELINE REMAINS ROBUST TO REAL-WORLD CHALLENGES SUCH AS ILLUMINATION CHANGES.
utt_0111 utt 471.81 478.72 -X NOTE THAT THE JACOBIAN SPARSENESS PATTERN IS SIMILAR TO GEOMETRIC SFM AND THUS EFFICIENT SCHEMES LIKE THE SCHUR COMPLEMENT TRICK APPLY.
utt_0113 utt 479.93 484.58 -X THE REFINED REPROJECTIONS ARE MUCH BETTER LOCALIZED COMPARED TO THEIR GEOMETRIC COUNTERPART,
utt_0114 utt 484.77 491.07 -X AND THE FEATUREMETRIC BA ALLOWS TO FURTHER REDUCE THE NOISE OVER THE KEYPOINT ADJUSTMENT BY UTILIZING GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS.
utt_0116 utt 491.87 496.45 -X THE OBTAINED GRADIENTS TOWARDS THE ROBUST REFERENCE ARE LOCALLY SMOOTH,
utt_0117 utt 496.45 499.97 -X ALLOWING A LARGE CONVERGENCE FROM COARSE PRIORS.
utt_0118 utt 500.13 507.72 -X OUR METHOD CAN RECONSTRUCT LOCAL GEOMETRIES SUCH AS THE HORIZONTAL LINES ON THIS TOWER BUT ALSO LARGE ELEMENTS LIKE THE OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN DOME.
utt_0120 utt 509.02 523.46 -X TEXTURED SURFACES LIKE ARCHES AND MONUMENTS WITH FINE DETAILS CAN BE RECOVERED USING OUR PIXEL-PERFECT STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION, AND FROM A TOP-VIEW, ONE CAN SEE THAT ESPECIALLY PLANAR STRUCTURES LIKE WALLS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, EVEN ON SMALLER SCENES.
utt_0125 utt 529.95 539.59 -X THE PROPOSED PIPELINE YIELDS CLOSE TO LIDAR ACCURACY AND GREATLY IMPROVES POINTS WITH ONLY A FEW OBSERVATIONS, ENABLING SUBPIXEL ACCURACY IN LARGE-SCALE SFM.
utt_0127 utt 540.54 546.63 -X BOTH ON INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SCENES, PIXEL-PERFECT SFM OUTPERFORMS BOTH COLMAP AND PATCHFLOW
utt_0128 utt 547.04 549.28 -X ON THE ETHthreeD TRIANGULATION BENCHMARK.
utt_0129 utt 549.92 555.91 -X ESPECIALLY LEARNED FEATURES LIKE SUPERPOINT OR Dtwo-NET BENEFIT FROM OUR REFINEMENT.
utt_0130 utt 555.91 560.97 -X WE ALSO APPLY OUR METHOD TO CAMERA RE-LOCALIZATION, AND PROPOSE A FEATURE-METRIC REFINEMENT STRATEGY.
utt_0131 utt 561.60 566.60 -X AFTER FINDING twoDminus threeD CORRESPONDENCES, WE EXTRACT A REFERENCE DESCRIPTOR FOR EACH threeD POINT
utt_0132 utt 566.85 572.61 -X AND REFINE THE KEYPOINTS IN THE QUERY IMAGE BY MINIMIZING THE FEATUREMETRIC ERROR TO THE REFERENCE.
utt_0133 utt 572.90 576.84 -X THE PNP-ALGORITHM IS USED TO ESTIMATE A ROUGH PRIOR FOR THE CAMERA POSE,
utt_0134 utt 577.06 580.77 -X WHICH IS AGAIN REFINED BY ALIGNING DEEP FEATURES.
utt_0135 utt 580.77 583.91 -X WE EVALUATE THE LOCALIZATION ACCURACY ON THE ETHthreeD DATASET.
utt_0136 utt 585.44 591.40 -X THE METHOD CLEARLY OUTPERFORMS PATCH FLOW ON BOTH STANDARD FEATURES LIKE SIFT AND RECENT LEARNED ONES LIKE SUPERPOINT.
utt_0142 utt 605.86 612.14 -X COMPARED TO ITS MAIN COMPETITOR PATCH FLOW, OUR SYSTEM IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE FASTER,
utt_0143 utt 612.93 615.78 -X WITH LESS THAN twenty% OVERHEAD TO THE CLASSICAL SFM PIPELINE.
utt_0144 utt 616.23 621.48 -X WITH SOME LOCAL APPROXIMATIONS, IT IS ABLE TO SCALE TO THOUSANDS OF IMAGES EVEN ON A NORMAL PC.
utt_0146 utt 622.95 632.42 -X WE PRESENTED PIXEL-PERFECT STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION, A TWO-STEP REFINEMENT STRATEGY FOR KEYPOINTS AND SPARSE SFM BY ALIGNING DEEP FEATURE MAPS.
