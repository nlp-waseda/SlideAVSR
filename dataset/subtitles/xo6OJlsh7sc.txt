utt_0000 utt 0.29 9.02 -X IN THIS WORK WE TACKLE THE CHALLENGE OF LARGE-SCALE IMAGE LOCALIZATION BY PROPOSING TO SELF-SUPERVISE FINE-GRAINED REGION SIMILARITIES
utt_0002 utt 10.32 14.16 -X IMAGE LOCALIZATION CAN BE CAST AS AN IMAGE RETRIEVAL TASK
utt_0003 utt 14.19 24.83 -X WHERE THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF A GIVEN QUERY IMAGE IS ESTIMATED BY RECOGNIZING ITS NEAREST REFERENCE IMAGES CAPTURED AT THE SAME PLACE FROM A LARGE SCALE DATABASE
utt_0006 utt 25.74 39.83 -X THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE OF IMAGE RETRIEVAL TASKS IS TO LEARN IMAGE REPRESENTATIONS THAT ARE DISCRIMINATIVE ENOUGH TO TELL APART DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SO HERE IMAGE LOCALIZATION IS TREATED AS
utt_0009 utt 39.83 53.36 -X A WEEKLY SUPERVISED TASK BECAUSE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLOSE BY IMAGES MAY NOT DEPICT THE SAME SCENE WHEN FACING DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO AVOID BEING MISLED BY WEAK GPS LABELS
utt_0012 utt 53.36 66.45 -X PREVIOUS WORKS UTILIZED ON THE FLY TOP one IMAGES OF THE QUERIES AS THEIR POSITIVE TRAINING SAMPLES SUCH AN OPERATION IS TO FORCE THE QUERIES TO BE CLOSER TO THE ALREADY NEAREST NEIGHBORS
utt_0015 utt 66.70 74.12 -X OR IN OTHER WORDS THE EASIEST POSITIVE SAMPLES WHICH WILL RESULT IN LACK OF ROBUSTNESS TO VARYING CONDITIONS
utt_0017 utt 74.16 88.53 -X SINCE THE TOP one IMAGES ARE TOO SIMPLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPERVISIONS FOR LEARNING ROBUST REPRESENTATIONS SO WE ARGUE THAT DIFFICULT POSITIVES ARE NEEDED IDENTIFYING THE TRUE DIFFICULT POSITIVES
utt_0020 utt 88.53 102.10 -X IS CHALLENGING WITH ONLY GPS LABELS FOR EACH QUERY IMAGE ITS K-NEAREST DATABASE IMAGE MIGHT STILL CONTAIN FALSE POSITIVE SAMPLES DIRECTLY UTILIZING THEM AS DIFFICULT TRUE POSITIVES IN EXISTING
utt_0023 utt 102.10 104.71 -X PIPELINES MIGHT WORSEN THE LEARNED FEATURES
utt_0024 utt 105.27 118.41 -X HOW TO PROPERLY USE NOISY DIFFICULT POSITIVES IS CRUCIAL TO REPRESENTATION LEARNING WE PROPOSE TO ESTIMATE QUERY GALLERY SIMILARITIES AS INFORMATIVE SOFT SUPERVISIONS
utt_0027 utt 118.41 128.91 -X TO TRAIN WITH NOISY POSITIVE SAMPLES SPECIFICALLY THE SIMILARITY LABELS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SMALLER FOR FALSE POSITIVES OR TRUE POSITIVES
utt_0029 utt 128.91 143.05 -X WITH SMALL OVERLAPPING REGIONS IN SUCH A WAY WE CAN PROPERLY EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF DIFFICULT POSITIVES AND AVOID ERROR AMPLIFICATION CAUSED BY FALSE POSITIVES SO HOW COULD WE ESTIMATE SUCH SIMILARITY
utt_0032 utt 143.05 150.20 -X LABELS WE TRAIN THE NETWORK FOR THE FIRST GENERATION FOLLOWING THE EXISTING PIPELINES WITH ONLY EASIEST POSITIVES
utt_0034 utt 150.23 163.76 -X AND THEN QUERY GALLERY SIMILARITIES ESTIMATED BY THE FIRST GENERATIONS NETWORK SERVE AS SOFT SUPERVISION FOR TRAINING THE NETWORK IN A SECOND GENERATION HERE IS THE FORMULATION OF SIMILARITY
utt_0037 utt 163.76 176.67 -X LABELS THE IMAGE TO IMAGE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN EACH QUERY AND ITS K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS ARE ESTIMATED BY THE NETWORK TRAIN IN GENERATION one. AND SUCH SIMILARITY LABELS SERVE AS SOFT
utt_0040 utt 176.67 183.04 -X LEARNING TARGETS TO SUPERVISE THE TRAINING OF THE NETWORK IN GENERATION two IN THE FORM OF A CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS
utt_0042 utt 183.96 191.58 -X THE ABOVE PROCESS CAN ITERATE AND TRAIN THE NETWORK FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS TO PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVE THE LEARNED FEATURES
utt_0044 utt 193.40 202.72 -X PREVIOUSLY WE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO EXPLOIT DIFFICULT POSITIVES HOWEVER EVEN WITH TRUE POSITIVES THERE MIGHT STILL BE NON-OVERLAPPING REGIONS
utt_0046 utt 203.07 217.41 -X UTILIZING ONLY THE IMAGE LEVEL SUPERVISIONS SIMPLY FORCES FEATURES FROM OTHER SPATIAL REGIONS TO APPROACH THE SAME TARGET SCORES SUCH AN OPERATION WOULD HURT THE LEARNING OF DISCRIMINATIVE LOCAL FEATURES
utt_0050 utt 217.56 227.90 -X THEREFORE THE IDEAL SUPERVISIONS SHOULD PROVIDE MORE ROBUST REGION LEVEL CORRESPONDENCES SPECIFICALLY WE DECOMPOSE THE POSITIVE
utt_0052 utt 227.90 240.79 -X IMAGES INTO FOUR HALF REGIONS AND FOUR QUARTER REGIONS THE QUERY TO REGION SIMILARITIES ESTIMATED FROM THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS NETWORK CAN SERVE AS MORE FINE-GRAINED GUIDANCE FOR FEATURE LEARNING
utt_0055 utt 242.37 245.83 -X HERE IS THE FORMULATION OF FINE-GRAINED SIMILARITY LABELS
utt_0056 utt 246.30 254.85 -X FOR EACH QUERY IMAGE BOTH THE QUERY TO IMAGE AND QUERY TO REGION SIMILARITIES ARE ESTIMATED AS SOFT LEARNING TARGETS
utt_0058 utt 256.06 260.24 -X HERE ARE THE RESULTS ON TWO PUBLIC BENCHMARKS FOR IMAGE LOCALIZATION
utt_0059 utt 260.45 274.40 -X WE ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ESPECIALLY ON THE MORE CHALLENGING TOKYO DATA SET WE ALSO VISUALIZE THE FEATURE MAPS FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUPERIORITY OF OUR METHOD COMPARED TO THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SARE
utt_0063 utt 276.83 286.05 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE S-A-R-E FAILS IN IDENTIFYING THE CORRECT TOP ONE IMAGE DUE TO THE LACK OF ROBUSTNESS IN VARYING ILLUMINATIONS
utt_0065 utt 286.85 298.09 -X SPECIFICALLY THEY IGNORE THE STREET SHOPS WHICH PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR LOCALIZING THE QUERY IMAGE SARE ALSO WRONGLY FOCUSES ON THE
utt_0067 utt 298.09 312.13 -X MISLEADING TREES IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE DUE TO THE LACK OF DISCRIMINATIVE LOCAL REPRESENTATIONS WHICH SHOWS THE NECESSITY OF REGION LEVEL TRAINING SUPERVISION THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR WORK
