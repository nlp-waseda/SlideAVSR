utt_0000 utt 1.04 8.19 -X WE PRESENT AN APPROACH FOR INFERENCE OF BLACK HOLE FLUID DYNAMICS FROM SPARSE INTERFEROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
utt_0002 utt 10.80 16.95 -X IN two thousand and nineteen THE EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE COLLABORATION PRODUCED THE FIRST-EVER BLACK HOLE IMAGE
utt_0003 utt 18.83 26.77 -X THIS IMAGE WAS COMPUTATIONALLY CONSTRUCTED FROM MEASUREMENTS OF SYNCHRONIZED TELESCOPES COLLECTED OVER THE COURSE OF AN ENTIRE NIGHT
utt_0005 utt 27.57 33.75 -X KEY TO THIS RESULT IS THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION THAT Meighty-seven IS STATIC DURING ACQUISITION
utt_0006 utt 35.79 42.79 -X IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT AN APPROACH TO INFER DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SOURCES THAT EVOLVE DURING ACQUISITION
utt_0008 utt 43.83 52.95 -X THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR STUDYING THE BLACK HOLE IN THE HEART OF OUR OWN MILKY WAY GALAXY WHICH RAPIDLY EVOLVES ON THE TIME SCALE OF MINUTES
utt_0010 utt 54.74 60.73 -X IMAGES FROM THE EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE ARE RECONSTRUCTED FROM INTERFEROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS
utt_0011 utt 61.40 66.17 -X THESE MEASUREMENTS RELATE TO THE UNDERLYING SOURCE THROUGH ITS FOURIER TRANSFORM
utt_0012 utt 68.31 75.38 -X A KEY CHALLENGE IS THAT WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO MEASURE VERY FEW SPATIAL FREQUENCIES WHILE THE SOURCE IS EVOLVING
utt_0014 utt 76.98 86.71 -X IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT AN APPROACH THAT ALLOWS US TO USE THESE EXTREMELY SPARSE MEASUREMENTS TO EXTRACT STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF THE GAS SURROUNDING A BLACK HOLE
utt_0016 utt 87.67 99.24 -X NAMELY, WE FOCUS ON ESTIMATING SPATIAL CORRELATIONS WHICH CHARACTERIZE THE WISPY TEXTURE AROUND THE BLACK HOLE AT EACH FRAME AND A VELOCITY FIELD WHICH DICTATES THE MOTION
utt_0018 utt 101.05 106.14 -X WE MODEL A VIDEO AS A COMPOSITION OF A STATIC IMAGE AND RANDOM DYNAMICS
utt_0019 utt 109.85 117.57 -X THE RANDOM DYNAMICS ARE GIVEN AS A SOLUTION TO A STOCHASTIC PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION (SPDE),
utt_0020 utt 117.57 122.85 -X WHICH IS PARAMETERIZED BY THE CORRELATION AND VELOCITY FIELDS WE JUST DISCUSSED
utt_0021 utt 124.41 129.07 -X IN THE INVERSE PROBLEM WE JOINTLY ESTIMATE THESE THREE UNKNOWN FIELDS
utt_0022 utt 129.18 133.23 -X THE SPATIAL CORRELATIONS, VELOCITY, AND STATIC IMAGE
utt_0023 utt 134.97 143.78 -X A KEY CHALLENGE TO ESTIMATING THE DYNAMICS IS THAT PIXEL VALUES ARE DRIVEN BY AN UNKNOWN RANDOM SOURCE, WHICH WE DO NOT WANT TO ESTIMATE.
utt_0025 utt 144.19 148.93 -X THIS MEANS THAT TWO RANDOM FIELDS, WITH THE SAME UNDERLYING PARAMETERS,
utt_0026 utt 148.93 151.46 -X RESULT IN VERY DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OVER TIME
utt_0027 utt 153.09 162.08 -X AN INSIGHT OF OUR WORK IS THAT BY USING DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION WE CAN DETERMINE THE PARAMETERS THAT BEST FIT THE DYNAMICS OF A RANDOM FIELD
utt_0029 utt 163.61 170.18 -X FOR A GIVEN PARAMETER SET WE EXTRACT THE TOP MODES WHICH CAPTURE MOST OF THE VARIABILITY OF THE SPDE
utt_0030 utt 171.14 178.24 -X AS WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A MATRIX OPERATOR THIS IS A CHALLENGE, WHICH WE ADDRESS IN THE PAPER.
utt_0031 utt 178.24 183.17 -X WE COMPUTE THE PROJECTION OF THE RANDOM FIELD ONTO A SUBSPACE SPANNED BY THESE MODES
utt_0032 utt 185.15 192.52 -X IF THE SUBSPACE REPRESENTS THE RANDOM FIELD WELL, THE PROJECTION RESIDUAL WILL BE SMALL.
utt_0033 utt 192.52 196.20 -X PARAMETERS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT GENERATED THE RANDOM FIELD,
utt_0034 utt 196.20 200.52 -X WILL RESULT IN A SUBSPACE THAT DOES NOT CAPTURE THE RANDOM FIELD WELL.
utt_0035 utt 202.21 205.45 -X THEREFORE, THE PROJECTION RESIDUAL WILL BE HIGH
utt_0036 utt 207.30 210.95 -X BY COMPUTING THE PROJECTION RESIDUAL FOR DIFFERENT PARAMETERS,
utt_0037 utt 210.95 218.57 -X WE ESTIMATE THE UNDERLYING TRUE PARAMETERS AS THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TO A LOSS FUNCTION.
utt_0038 utt 218.57 227.75 -X IN THE PAPER, WE SHOW HOW THE PROJECTION EXTENDS TO THE SUBSPACE SPANNED BY SPARSE MEASUREMENTS OF THE EVENT HORIZON TELESCOPE (EHT)
utt_0040 utt 228.49 236.33 -X IN SIMULATIONS, WE USE SYNTHETIC EHT MEASUREMENTS AND JOINTLY RECOVER THE UNKNOWN STATIC IMAGE AND DYNAMIC PARAMETERS
utt_0042 utt 238.18 244.65 -X HAVING ACCESS TO GROUND-TRUTH PARAMETERS ALLOWS US TO QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS OUR RECOVERY APPROACH
utt_0043 utt 246.34 252.04 -X WE ALSO SHOW THAT OUR APPROACH PERFORMS WELL EVEN WITH EXTREMELY SPARSE MEASUREMENTS.
utt_0044 utt 253.54 260.33 -X WE COMPARE OUR RESULTS TO THOSE ACHIEVED BY STATE-OF-THE-ART IMAGING WHICH ESTIMATES A WHOLE VIDEO SEQUENCE
utt_0046 utt 261.07 269.60 -X IN THE RECOVERED VIDEO MOST OF THE DYNAMIC INFORMATION IS LOST MAKING SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF MOTION DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE
utt_0048 utt 271.21 276.37 -X WE SHOW THAT A MODEL-BASED APPROACH IS ADVANTAGEOUS WHEN THE MEASUREMENTS ARE SPARSE
utt_0049 utt 278.06 288.80 -X FINALLY, WE SHOW THAT WE CAN HANDLE MODEL MISMATCH AND THAT THE SPDE MODEL CAN CAPTURE COMPLEX DYNAMICS OF PHYSICALLY REALISTIC BLACK HOLE SIMULATIONS
utt_0051 utt 289.36 299.67 -X THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE PROMISE FOR APPLYING OUR APPROACH TO ANALYSIS OF FUTURE EHT MEASUREMENTS OF THE SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE IN OUR GALACTIC CENTER
