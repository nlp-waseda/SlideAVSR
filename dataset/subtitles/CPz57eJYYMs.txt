utt_0000 utt 1.58 7.63 -X HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS AKHIL ARORA AND I AM A PHD STUDENT AFFILIATED WITH THE DATA SCIENCE LAB
utt_0001 utt 8.11 21.36 -X AT EPFL IN SWITZERLAND TODAY I AM GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOW WELL AND UNDER WHAT SCENARIOS CAN WE APPROXIMATE WIKIPEDIA READER NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR USING SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATED FROM
utt_0003 utt 21.36 26.93 -X PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES THIS IS JOINT WORK WITH MARTIN GERLACH FROM THE WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION
utt_0004 utt 27.37 39.87 -X MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DATA SCIENCE LAB AND MY ADVISOR BOB BEST WHEN USERS BROWSE ANY WEBSITE THEY LEAVE INFORMATION TRACES OF THEIR NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR WHICH FURTHER TELLS US
utt_0006 utt 39.98 47.73 -X HOW THESE USERS INTERACT WITH OR CONSUME THE CONTENT OF CONTENT PROVIDED BY THESE WEBSITES
utt_0007 utt 48.69 60.53 -X IN THE CONTEXT OF WIKIPEDIA THESE TRACES CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS DEPICTING THE LEARNING PATHWAYS TAKEN BY THE WIKIPEDIA READERS NATURALLY INSIGHTS INTO NAVIGATION PATTERNS HAVE HIGH UTILITY
utt_0009 utt 61.39 73.36 -X AS THEY CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND AND BETTER SERVE READERS NEEDS THEY CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS KNOWLEDGE GAPS OR THEY CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE ANY STRUCTURAL BIASES THAT MAY EXIST WELL
utt_0011 utt 73.36 85.09 -X THEY CAN ALSO BE USED TO ORGANIZE ARTICLES INTO A CURRICULUM FOR WIKIPEDIA READERS WHICH WILL ONLY HELP IMPROVE THE READING EXPERIENCE OVER OF THESE FOR THESE READERS ON WIKIPEDIA THAT SAID DESPITE
utt_0013 utt 85.09 97.11 -X SO MANY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS SYSTEMATIC STUDIES ON NAVIGATION WIKIPEDIA ARE FAIRLY LIMITED AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF ONE KEY CHALLENGE IN A COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY
utt_0015 utt 97.11 101.88 -X OF WIKIPEDIA READERS THE REAL NAVIGATION TRACES ARE KEPT PRIVATE BY THE WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION
utt_0016 utt 103.28 116.53 -X THANKFULLY THERE EXISTS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RESOURCE CALLED THE WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM WHICH IS A DATA SET THAT CONSISTS OF COUNTS OF REFERER RESOURCE PAIRS EXTRACTED FROM THE VERY PRIVATELY
utt_0018 utt 116.53 123.60 -X HELD NAVIGATION TRACE DATA LOGGED INTO THE SERVERS OF THE WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION ONE CAN THINK OF
utt_0019 utt 123.60 137.88 -X THESE INTERACTIONS AS BEING THE INTERACTIONS THAT HAPPEN IN THE FIRST HOP NEIGHBORHOOD OF EACH PAGE TO ALSO FURTHER ENSURE PRIVACY WHAT IS DONE IS THAT ALL THE INTERACTIONS THAT HAPPEN LESS
utt_0021 utt 137.88 149.00 -X THAN ten TIMES ARE ALSO OMITTED FROM THIS DATA WHILE THIS IS GOOD NEWS THAT THERE EXISTS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RESOURCE THAT CAPTURES NAVIGATION ON WIKIPEDIA
utt_0023 utt 149.62 160.82 -X THIS DATA SET PRESENTS ONE MORE CHALLENGE THE NEXT PAGE VISITS HERE ONLY DEPENDS ON THE CURRENT PAGE AND NOT ON ANY OTHER PREVIOUSLY VISITED PAGES IN OTHER WORDS
utt_0025 utt 160.82 165.43 -X WE CAN SAY THAT THIS DATA SET ONLY CAPTURES THE FIRST ORDER READER NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR
utt_0026 utt 167.15 176.69 -X IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS TALK WE WILL NOW ASSESS THE UTILITY OF THE WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM AS A RESOURCE FOR STUDYING READER NAVIGATION ON WIKIPEDIA
utt_0028 utt 176.69 188.76 -X AND WE DO SO BY FORMALIZING TWO KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS FIRST HOW DIFFERENT ARE REAL TRAJECTORIES FROM SYNTHETIC TRAJECTORIES GENERATED USING THE WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM
utt_0030 utt 188.76 201.78 -X AND SECOND HOW WELL CAN WE APPROXIMATE READER NAVIGATION VIA WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM DATA TO ANSWER OUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS WE LOOK INTO FOUR DIFFERENT TYPE OF SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED
utt_0032 utt 201.78 207.32 -X TRAJECTORIES AND COMPARE THEM WITH THE REAL TRAJECTORIES USING SIX DIFFERENT ANALYSES
utt_0033 utt 207.73 217.98 -X CONDUCTED ACROSS EIGHT DIFFERENT WIKIPEDIA LANGUAGE VERSIONS FOR WHICH THE CLICK STREAM DATA IS AVAILABLE TALKING A BIT ABOUT SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED TRAJECTORIES
utt_0035 utt 218.39 231.16 -X WE LOOK INTO THIS TABLE WHICH SUMMARIZES THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL THE DATA SETS CONSIDERED IN THE STUDY ONE CAN OBSERVE THAT ONE COMMONALITY ACROSS ALL THE SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED DATA SETS
utt_0037 utt 231.16 244.28 -X IS THAT THEY FOLLOW A MARKOV ORDER ONE PROCESS THAT IS THEY ONLY CAPTURE FIRST ORDER READER NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR ONE KEY DIFFERENCE THAT EMERGES IS THAT THE TRANSITION PROBABILITIES
utt_0039 utt 244.28 256.63 -X THAT GOVERNS THE RANDOM WALKS WERE GENERATED GENERATING THESE SEQUENCES ARE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY ARE OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT RESOURCES FOR FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE DATA GENERATION
utt_0041 utt 257.43 268.44 -X WE REFER YOU TO OUR PAPER MOVING ON WE WILL ONLY FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN THE PAPER ONLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND ALSO BECAUSE THIS IS
utt_0043 utt 268.69 272.94 -X BECAUSE OF ITS INTUITIVE APPEAL WHICH IS THE MIXING OF FLOWS AND FOR ALL OTHER
utt_0044 utt 273.21 278.30 -X ANALYSIS DONE IN THE PAPER WE REFER YOU TO THE TO THE FULLER CONTENT IN THE PAPER
utt_0045 utt 279.83 286.71 -X SO IN THIS ANALYSIS WHAT WE DO IS WE LOOK INTO TRAJECTORIES THAT PASS THROUGH A GIVEN ARTICLE
utt_0046 utt 287.25 290.51 -X AND WE CONNECT THE SOURCE AND THE TARGET PAGES
utt_0047 utt 290.93 296.84 -X AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO ASSESS WHETHER THERE EXISTS ANY PREDICTABILITY THAT IS
utt_0048 utt 296.92 310.51 -X GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOURCE ARTICLE CAN WE PREDICT WHAT'S THE LIKELY TARGET ARTICLE THAT PASSES THROUGH THE INTERMEDIATE ARTICLE LET'S LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE RIGHT? SO IN THIS PARTICULAR
utt_0050 utt 311.61 322.24 -X IN THIS PARTICULAR PLOT ON THE LEFT SIDE WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THAT THE INTERMEDIATE ARTICLE IS CHARLES PRINCE OF WALES AND WE ARE LOOKING INTO ALL TRAJECTORIES THAT PASS THROUGH THIS ARTICLE
utt_0052 utt 322.78 334.75 -X AND THE SOURCES ARE INDICATED ON THE LEFT AND THE TARGETS ARE INDICATED ON THE RIGHT AND AND BOTH PLOTS HAVE THE SIMILAR ORGANIZATION WHAT CAN BE SEEN IS THAT THE
utt_0054 utt 336.09 343.74 -X ONE ONE CAN SEE A MIXING THAT WE CAN OBSERVE IN THE INCOMING TRAFFIC AND THE OUTGOING TRAFFIC
utt_0055 utt 343.74 357.98 -X AND OUR OUR INTUITION IS THAT THE HIGHER THIS MIXING THE LOWER THE PREDICTABILITY WHICH IS WHICH BECOMES CLEARER WHEN YOU LOOK AT BOTH THE PLOTS BECAUSE ON THE LEFT SIDE IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR THAT
utt_0057 utt 357.98 369.53 -X EVEN WHEN WE KNOW WE WHEN WE KNOW THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SOURCE THAT IS ELIZABETH THE SECOND THE THE TARGETS APPEAR ALMOST EQUALLY LIKELY SO WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH HIGHER PROBABILITY
utt_0059 utt 369.53 382.88 -X WHAT'S THE USUAL TARGET ON THE OTHER HAND ON THE RIGHT PLOT WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THAT IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT WE WILL TAKE THIS PATH SO TO FORMALIZE THIS FURTHER WHAT WE SAY IS THAT
utt_0061 utt 384.41 392.67 -X THE THE PREDICTABILITY IS HOW STRONG THE PREDICTABILITY IS CAPTURED BY HOW STRONG OR WEAK
utt_0062 utt 392.67 400.13 -X THE MIXING IS THAT IS THE STRONGER THE MIXING THE LOWER THE PREDICTABILITY AND THE HIGHER THE MIXING
utt_0063 utt 400.19 408.51 -X THE THE THE AND THE WEAKER THE MIXING THE HIGHER THE PREDICTABILITY AND THIS THING IS FORMALIZED
utt_0064 utt 408.51 421.41 -X USING MUTUAL INFORMATION THIS BASICALLY CAPTURES HOW MUCH DOES ONE RANDOM VARIABLE TELLS US ABOUT ANOTHER AND IN THIS CASE BASICALLY HOW MUCH DOES THE KNOWLEDGE OF SOURCE ACTUALLY TELL US
utt_0066 utt 421.41 429.54 -X ABOUT THE TARGET ARTICLE T SO THINKING ABOUT THE EXTREME CASE WHAT WE CAN SAY IS IF THERE IS NO
utt_0067 utt 429.54 443.14 -X PREDICTABILITY THAT IS THE THAT IS THESE KNOWLEDGE OF SOURCE AND LIKE THE RANDOM VARIABLES DEPICTING THE SOURCE AND THE TARGET ARTICLES ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT THEN THE MUTUAL INFORMATION WILL BE
utt_0069 utt 443.14 451.97 -X ZERO AND THE THE MIXING WOULD BE HIGH OR AND VICE VERSA AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS HERE RIGHT?
utt_0070 utt 451.97 458.66 -X THIS LEFT SIDE OF THE PLOT INDICATES STRONG MIXING AND WE OBSERVE A VERY LOW MUTUAL INFORMATION
utt_0071 utt 458.91 469.98 -X AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PLOT INDICATE WEAK MIXING HIGH PREDICTABILITY AND THAT'S WHY WE OBSERVE A HIGH VIRTUAL INFORMATION SO THIS IS THIS SERVES AS THE BASE OF THIS ANALYSIS BUT
utt_0073 utt 470.27 484.29 -X WHAT WE SEE NEXT IS ACTUALLY A REMARKABLE UH FINDING WHAT WE SEE IS THAT MAJORITY OF REAL TRAJECTORIES ACTUALLY EXHIBIT VERY STRONG MIXING OR MUTUAL INFORMATION CLOSE TO ZERO
utt_0075 utt 484.61 492.16 -X AND ONLY LESS THAN ten PAGES HAVE A MUTUAL INFORMATION HIGHER THAN zero point one AND THIS IS A
utt_0076 utt 492.35 501.99 -X PLOT WHICH THIS WHICH DEPICTS AN EXPONENTIAL DECAY SO THIS THIS PARTICULAR FINDING SHOWS THAT MOST
utt_0077 utt 502.43 509.79 -X MOST TRAJECTORIES IN THE REAL NAVIGATION UH SEQUENCES OBSERVED IN WIKIPEDIA HAVE
utt_0078 utt 510.59 524.18 -X ALMOST NO PREDICTABILITY AND THAT'S WHY THEY ARE CLOSER TO A ORDER ONE PROCESS WELL THE IDEA IS NOT TO OVERWHELM THE READER WITH THE NUMBERS BUT WHAT WE WANT TO SHOW HERE IS THAT THE KEY MESSAGE IS
utt_0080 utt 524.18 537.79 -X THAT THE THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL AND SYNTHETIC NAVIGATION SEQUENCES IS IS ACTUALLY WELL WITHIN ten PERCENT FOR MAJORITY OF THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS AND THE ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IN THIS WORK
utt_0082 utt 537.79 548.13 -X MOVING ON THE KEY TAKEAWAYS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WORK IS THAT FOR MANY CASES CLICK STREAM DATA IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR STUDYING READER NAVIGATION ON WIKIPEDIA AND THE THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPACT OF
utt_0084 utt 548.13 560.77 -X THIS FINDING IS THAT RESEARCH ON NAVIGATION IN WIKIPEDIA BECOMES ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDER AUDIENCE IN FACT THE WMF TEAM HAS ALREADY STARTED WORKING ON MAKING OR ACTUALLY GENERATING CLICK STREAM
utt_0086 utt 560.77 571.27 -X DATA FOR MORE AND MORE LANGUAGES THEN THE OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT IT ACTUALLY BOLSTERS USER PRIVACY BECAUSE THERE IS NO NEED TO STORE OR REVEAL SENSITIVE DATA FOR CASE FOR MAJORITY
utt_0088 utt 571.27 584.29 -X OF THE CASES THAT SAID THERE EXIST CASES WHEN REAL DATA IS REQUIRED THAT IS THE CLICK STREAM DATA IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE CAN THINK OF SOME EXAMPLES LIKE WHEN WE WANT TO TRACK ACTIVITIES OF THE SAME USERS
utt_0090 utt 584.29 594.88 -X LIKE REVISITATION PATTERNS OR MULTITASK BEHAVIOR OR WHEN WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT HOW USERS INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT CONTENT OF WIKIPEDIA PAGE LIKE IMAGES OR INFO BOXES
utt_0092 utt 594.98 604.68 -X OR EVEN UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION CONSUMPTION PATTERNS WHICH INVOLVE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME STAMPS OR GEO LOCATIONS AND THESE THINGS CANNOT BE DONE USING THE WIKIPEDIA CLICKSTREAM DATA AS OF NOW
utt_0094 utt 605.22 618.02 -X ANYWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT THIS STUDY HAS A BROADER IMPACT BECAUSE FOR MOST PRACTICAL DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS THE CLICK STREAM DATA IS GOOD ENOUGH AND CLICK STREAM LIKE DATA CAN
utt_0096 utt 618.02 628.36 -X EMPOWER BROADER RESEARCH ON USER NAVIGATION ON ONLINE PLATFORMS THEREBY THIS ENCOURAGE THIS IS AN ENCOURAGING CALL FOR THE COMMUNITY TO RELEASE THESE DATA SETS WHEREVER POSSIBLE
utt_0098 utt 629.15 637.48 -X THERE STILL EXISTS AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER OUR FINDINGS WILL GENERALIZE BEYOND WIKIPEDIA BUT THIS IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND SHOULD BE STUDIED
utt_0100 utt 638.43 650.39 -X SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS WORK PROVIDES QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE OF THE UTILITY OF WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM AS A PUBLIC RESOURCE THAT CAN CLOSELY CAPTURE READER NAVIGATION ON WIKIPEDIA
utt_0102 utt 651.01 658.87 -X AND WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO USE WIKIPEDIA CLICK STREAM FOR THE DOWNSTREAM TASKS FOR THE CODE OR
utt_0103 utt 659.17 669.86 -X THE DATA SETS THAT WERE USED IN THE STUDY WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT OUR GITHUB PAGE UNDER THE DLAB GITHUB ORGANIZATION FOR A PRE-PRINT OF THIS PAPER YOU CAN ACCESS THE PREPRINT ON ARCHIVE
