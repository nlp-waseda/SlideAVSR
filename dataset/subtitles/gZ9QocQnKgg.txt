utt_0000 utt 0.05 9.58 -X GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JULIANO GARCIA DO CARMO RIBEIRO, AND I AM A PHD STUDENT OF THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO.
utt_0002 utt 10.03 13.17 -X I'LL BE PRESENTING OUR WORK FOR ICASSP two thousand and twenty-three:
utt_0003 utt 13.84 27.41 -X THE “KERNEL INTERPOLATION OF ACOUSTIC TRANSFER FUNCTIONS WITH ADAPTIVE KERNEL FOR DIRECTED AND RESIDUAL REVERBERATIONS.” SOUND WAVE PROPAGATION WITHIN A GIVEN SPACE CAN BE RATHER UNPREDICTABLE.
utt_0005 utt 27.41 36.15 -X HOWEVER, PREDICTING HOW A SPACE ALTERS THE PROPAGATION OF SOUND WITHIN IT HAS SEVERAL PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS:
utt_0006 utt 36.15 41.59 -X SOUND FIELD RECORDINGS, AUGMENTED AND VIRTUAL REALITY SYSTEMS, AND SURROUND SOUND SYSTEMS.
utt_0007 utt 41.59 46.10 -X FOR THAT REASON, IT IS OF INTEREST TO STUDY THE ACOUSTIC TRANSFER FUNCTION (ATF):
utt_0008 utt 46.10 59.48 -X THE FUNCTION THAT RELATES HOW A SIGNAL CAPTURED OR RECORDED AT A CERTAIN POINT DIFFERS FROM THE SAME SIGNAL AT THE ORIGINAL SOUND SOURCE.
utt_0010 utt 59.48 71.45 -X OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO INTERPOLATE THE ATF IN A REGION-TO-REGION FASHION, MEANING FREELY VARYING SOURCE AND RECEIVER POSITIONS WITHIN CONSTRAINED REGIONS.
utt_0011 utt 73.36 78.81 -X REGION TO REGION INTERPOLATION METHODS FOR THE ATF PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED:
utt_0012 utt 79.06 85.67 -X EMBEDDING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ATF INTO A TRUNCATED SPHERICAL FUNCTION EXPANSION
utt_0013 utt 87.38 93.88 -X AND EMBEDDING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES USING A REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACE(RKHS) WITH A SPECIFIC KERNEL,
utt_0014 utt 94.35 109.08 -X WHICH DELIVERS A MORE BROADLY APPLICABLE AND MORE PERFORMANT INTERPOLATION SYSTEM THAT IS ALSO EASIER TO GENERALIZE AND AS SUCH CAN BE MADE TO ADAPT TO THE DATA BETTER.
utt_0016 utt 109.75 116.95 -X IN ORDER TO CALCULATE THE INTERPOLATION FUNCTION FOR THE ATF, WE MUST FIRST DISTRIBUTE LOUDSPEAKERS AND MICROPHONES
utt_0017 utt 116.95 126.52 -X IN A SOURCE AND A RECEIVER REGIONS RESPECTIVELY, AND THEN MEASURE THE ATF BETWEEN EVERY POSSIBLE PAIR.
utt_0018 utt 126.52 130.97 -X THEN, WE TAKE THOSE MEASUREMENTS AND USE THEM TO DEVELOP THE INTERPOLATION OF THE ATF.
utt_0019 utt 133.11 142.14 -X WE MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF THE ATF. THE FIRST OF THEM BEING THAT THE ATF CAN BE DIVIDED THE FIRST OF THEM BEING THAT THE ATF CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS:
utt_0022 utt 145.69 149.31 -X WHICH WILL BE THE FOCUS OF OUR METHOD HERE.
utt_0023 utt 149.31 158.04 -X WHILE THE REVERBERANT COMPONENT IS UNKNOWN, ITS DYNAMICS ARE KNOWN TO TAKE FORM OF THE HELMHOLTZ EQUATION ON BOTH POSITIONAL VARIABLES.
utt_0024 utt 158.04 160.84 -X WE ALSO HAVE THE RECIPROCITY OF THE ATF.
utt_0025 utt 163.64 173.82 -X THE INTERPOLATION FUNCTION IS OBTAINED FROM THIS OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM, WHICH HINGES ON THE FEATURE SPACE H.
utt_0026 utt 175.00 180.41 -X THE FEATURE SPACE H IS PREFERABLY A RKHS - A REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACE -
utt_0027 utt 180.51 191.71 -X WITH THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES THAT ALSO ALLOW SOME FLEXIBILITY IN ORDER TO CREATE ADAPTIVE INTERPOLATION MODELS.
utt_0028 utt 192.38 198.62 -X FOR THAT REASON, WE EXPRESS THE REVERBERANT COMPONENT IN THE HERGLOTZ WAVE FUNCTION EXPANSION.
utt_0029 utt 198.62 203.29 -X THIS ALLOWS US TO DEFINE THIS REPRODUCING KERNEL HILBERT SPACE STRUCTURE WITH THIS KERNEL,
utt_0030 utt 203.67 209.50 -X WHICH HAS THE PHYSICS OF THE ATF ENFORCED BY THIS INTEGRAL OPERATOR T,
utt_0031 utt 209.50 214.37 -X MEANING THAT THE WEIGHT W CAN LEARN FREELY.
utt_0032 utt 217.02 220.35 -X OUR PREVIOUS METHODS CAN ALSO BE REDUCED TO THIS EXAMPLE:
utt_0033 utt 220.54 226.08 -X THE PAPER FROM two thousand and twenty UTILIZED WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO A UNIFORM WEIGHT.
utt_0034 utt 226.08 229.79 -X THAT IS TO SAY THE SAME GAIN FOR EVERY SINGLE DIRECTION ON THE SPHERE.
utt_0035 utt 230.11 235.87 -X WHILE THE two thousand and twenty-two PAPER INTRODUCED A SUNKEN SPHERE WEIGHT:
utt_0036 utt 236.93 241.07 -X A WEIGHT THAT HAS THE SAME GAIN ON THE SIDES BUT HAS
utt_0037 utt 242.43 249.54 -X TWO SUNKEN PORTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SEPARATION OF DIRECT AND REVERBERANT ATF FIELDS.
utt_0038 utt 251.26 263.08 -X THE PROPOSED ADAPTIVE WEIGHT W IS MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED IN THAT IT CONSIDERS TWO DIFFERENT MODELS, BOTH WITH MORE DEGREES OF FREEDOM THAN THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED MODELS FOR THE ATF.
utt_0041 utt 263.23 268.13 -X THE ADAPTIVE KERNEL IS THEN GIVEN AS THE ADDITION OF BOTH MODELS.
utt_0042 utt 268.22 280.93 -X THE FIRST WEIGHT MODEL TO CONSIDER IS THE DIRECTED WEIGHT MODEL, WHICH CONCERNS PLANE WAVES THAT HAVE HIGHER AMPLITUDE BUT ARE LOWER IN NUMBER.
utt_0043 utt 280.93 287.56 -X UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF PLANE WAVES HAVE A MUCH HIGHER AMPLITUDE THAN THE OTHERS,
utt_0044 utt 287.56 291.81 -X WE EXPRESS IT AS A SEPARABLE WEIGHT THAT IS THE PRODUCT OF TWO IDENTICAL WEIGHTS.
utt_0045 utt 292.10 300.25 -X AND THESE WEIGHTS ARE GIVEN AS A COMBINATION OF VON-MISES FISCHER FUNCTIONS WITH A Β PARAMETER
utt_0046 utt 300.26 310.09 -X REGULATING THE AMPLITUDE AND AN Α PARAMETER FOR THEIR COMBINATION. IN THIS Α PARAMETER, WE STICK A Lminus one CONDITION THAT PROMOTES SPARSITY.
utt_0047 utt 310.40 313.14 -X MEANING THAT THIS KERNEL HAS STRONG DIRECTIONALITY
utt_0048 utt 313.38 315.62 -X ONLY ON A SPARSE SET OF DIRECTIONS.
utt_0049 utt 317.28 324.20 -X THE REMAINING RESIDUAL WEIGHT EXPRESSES THE REMAINING PLANE WAVES IN THE FIELD.
utt_0050 utt 324.93 329.67 -X THE PARAMETERS OF THIS NETWORK, Θ, ARE NOT MANY.
utt_0051 utt 330.08 337.61 -X WE UTILIZE AS A VERY SIMPLE ARCHITECTURE. DESPITE THAT, IT IS STILL CAPABLE OF LEARNING IRREGULAR SHAPES AND PATTERNS.
utt_0052 utt 338.15 343.78 -X THE KERNEL IS THEN OBTAINED WITH NUMERICAL INTEGRATION, AND THE RECIPROCITY IS LEARNED BY DATA AUGMENTATION.
utt_0053 utt 344.39 348.81 -X WHERE THE PARAMETERS Β AND Θ ARE OPTIMIZED USING THE GRADIENT DESCENT METHOD,
utt_0054 utt 349.80 354.79 -X THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE PARAMETERS IS PERFORMED WITH A LEAVE ONE OUT CROSS VALIDATION ERROR,
utt_0055 utt 354.89 359.85 -X WHERE THE PARAMETERS Β AND Θ ARE OPTIMIZED USING THE GRADIENT DESCENT METHOD,
utt_0056 utt 360.93 370.63 -X AND Α IS OPTIMIZED USING THE REDUCED GRADIENT METHOD WITH A LINE SEARCH CRITERION, IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONDITIONS ARE RESPECTED.
utt_0057 utt 370.63 379.76 -X UNLIKE A DEEP LEARNING MODEL, THIS MODEL NEEDS NO OUTSIDE MEASUREMENTS. IT ONLY NEEDS THE RECORDED ATFS OF THE METHOD ALONE.
utt_0058 utt 381.06 386.06 -X IN ORDER TO TEST THE METHODS, WE USE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS WITH THESE CONDITIONS.
utt_0059 utt 387.21 394.96 -X AND WE COMPARED THE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED WEIGHTS WITH THE NEWLY PROPOSED WEIGHTS AND THE PROPOSED COMBINED WEIGHT.
utt_0061 utt 396.87 398.86 -X THE EVALUATION CRITERIA WERE:
utt_0062 utt 399.14 404.78 -X FOR THE FREQUENCY PERFORMANCE, WE CALCULATED THE NORMALIZED MEAN SQUARE ERROR (NMSE).
utt_0063 utt 404.78 409.68 -X AND FOR THE SPATIAL PERFORMANCE, WE CALCULATED THE NORMALIZED SQUARE ERROR (NSE).
utt_0064 utt 409.68 416.88 -X THE NORMALIZED MEAN SQUARE ERROR SHOWED THAT THE DIRECTED ONLY KERNEL OUTPERFORMED THE OTHER SINGLE KERNEL COMPONENTS,
utt_0065 utt 416.88 425.77 -X SHOWING THAT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE ARE A SELECT FEW PLANE WAVE DIRECTIONS THAT GET HIGHER GAIN DOES INDEED SEEM TO BE CORRECT.
utt_0066 utt 427.18 436.56 -X HOWEVER, THE PROPOSED OUTPERFORMED THE DIRECTED ONLY, SHOWING THAT THE RESIDUAL FIELD DOES HAVE A NOTICEABLE EFFECT, ESPECIALLY FOR HIGHER FREQUENCIES.
utt_0068 utt 436.56 442.77 -X THIS IS CONFIRMED ONCE AGAIN ONCE WE GO TO THE SPATIAL PERFORMANCE EXPERIMENTS
utt_0069 utt 443.24 446.29 -X SHOWING THAT THE PROPOSED COMBINED KERNEL (F)
utt_0070 utt 446.29 450.29 -X IS BETTER AT REPRODUCING A SOUND FIELD GENERATED BY A SINGLE SOURCE.
utt_0071 utt 450.92 455.50 -X WHICH IS FURTHER CORROBORATED BY THE ERROR MAP,
utt_0072 utt 455.50 458.55 -X WHICH SHOWS LOWER ERRORS IN A HIGHER AREA.
utt_0073 utt 458.99 471.81 -X IN CONCLUSION WE DEVISED AN INTERPOLATION FUNCTION THAT IS ADAPTIVE AND CONSIDERS DIRECTED AND RESIDUAL REVERBERATIONS WHILE GUARANTEEING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND DELIVERING BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED WEIGHTS
utt_0075 utt 472.01 476.02 -X WHILE ALSO PERFORMING BETTER THAN EACH WEIGHT SEPARATELY.
utt_0076 utt 476.02 477.01 -3.4771 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
