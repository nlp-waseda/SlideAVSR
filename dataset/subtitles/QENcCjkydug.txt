utt_0000 utt 0.03 6.48 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT NEAT, A METHOD FOR RECONSTRUCTING ARBITRARY SURFACES FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES.
utt_0002 utt 6.80 18.80 -X OUR MAIN IDEA IS TO REPRESENT THE threeD SURFACE USING A LEVEL SET OF ASSIGNED DISTANCE FUNCTION COUPLED WITH A VALIDITY BRANCH TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF THE SURFACE EXISTING AT THE QUERY POSITIONS.
utt_0005 utt 18.96 27.06 -X WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL NEURAL VOLUME RENDERER THAT AVOIDS RENDERING POINTS WITH LOW VALIDITY AND SUPPORTS EASY FIELD TO MESH CONVERSION.
utt_0007 utt 29.07 33.73 -X NEAT IS ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT CLOSED SURFACES FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES
utt_0008 utt 35.79 42.64 -X RECONSTRUCT OPEN SURFACES FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES [MUSIC] AS WELL AS RECONSTRUCT OPEN
utt_0009 utt 47.63 49.88 -X SURFACES FROM A SINGLE IMAGE [MUSIC]
utt_0010 utt 57.94 65.24 -X [MUSIC] HELLO EVERYONE, THIS IS XIAOXU MENG, A SENIOR RESEARCHER FROM TENCENT.
utt_0011 utt 65.39 73.53 -X HERE I'M GLAD TO PRESENT OUR WORK NEAT: LEARNING NEURAL IMPLICIT SURFACES WITH ARBITRARY TOPOLOGIES FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES.
utt_0013 utt 74.55 80.15 -X OUR GOAL IS TO LEARN GEOMETRY WITH BOTH OPEN AND CLOSE THE SURFACES FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES,
utt_0014 utt 80.21 85.78 -X AND EXPORT HIGH-FIDELITY AND NORMAL-CONSISTENT MESHES FROM THE NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0015 utt 85.94 91.19 -X THIS PROVIDES A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE FOR LEARNING threeD SHAPES DIRECTLY FROM twoD IMAGES
utt_0016 utt 91.38 93.01 -X WITHOUT threeD DATA.
utt_0017 utt 94.10 101.02 -X threeD RECONSTRUCTION FROM MULTI-VIEW IMAGES IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IN COMPUTER VISION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS.
utt_0019 utt 101.33 111.26 -X RECENT ADVANCES IN NEURAL IMPLICIT FUNCTIONS HAVE BROUGHT IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING HIGH-FIDELITY RECONSTRUCTION OF COMPLEX GEOMETRIES.
utt_0021 utt 111.86 119.83 -X HOWEVER, EXISTING NEURAL RENDERING METHODS REPRESENT SURFACES AS SDF, LIMITING THEIR OUTPUT TO CLOSED SURFACES.
utt_0023 utt 120.82 127.39 -X THESE APPROACHES ARE NOT APPLICABLE IN RECONSTRUCTING REAL-WORLD OBJECTS WITH OPEN BOUNDARIES, SUCH
utt_0025 utt 130.65 139.98 -X THE RECENTLY PROPOSED NDF, threePSDF, AND GIFS INTRODUCED NEW IMPLICIT REPRESENTATIONS SUPPORTING
utt_0026 utt 140.12 142.75 -X threeD GEOMETRY WITH ARBITRARY TOPOLOGIES.
utt_0027 utt 143.03 148.67 -X HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE METHODS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE CURRENT NEURAL RENDERING FRAMEWORKS.
utt_0028 utt 148.92 163.48 -X IN OUR WORK WE FILL THIS GAP BY PRESENTING NEAT, A NEURAL RENDERING FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS RECONSTRUCTING BOTH CLOSED AND OPEN SURFACES FROM IMAGES, AND SUPPORTS EFFICIENT FIELD TO MATCH CONVERSION.
utt_0031 utt 164.22 176.16 -X SO, THE BASIC IDEA IS TO REPRESENT THE SURFACE AS A LEVEL SET OF SDF WITH A VALIDITY BRANCH FOR ESTIMATING THE SURFACE EXISTENCE PROBABILITY AT QUERY POSITIONS.
utt_0033 utt 176.73 178.65 -X HERE IS A twoD EXAMPLE.
utt_0034 utt 178.65 182.75 -X WITH A GIVEN SDF, WE COULD EXPORT A CLOSER SURFACE.
utt_0035 utt 183.00 189.37 -X IN NEAT, WE ALSO USE A VALIDITY BRANCH TO ESTIMATE THE VALIDITY OF THE SDF SPACE.
utt_0036 utt 189.40 199.74 -X FOR INSTANCE, IF WE KNOW THE PROBABILITY OF THE BOTTOM LINE BEING VALID IS ZERO, WE ASSIGN NOT A NUMBER TO THE LOW VALIDITY SPF.
utt_0038 utt 200.41 207.49 -X THIS HELPS US EXTRACT OPEN SURFACES INSTEAD OF A CLOSED SURFACE USING THE MARGIN CUBES ALGORITHM.
utt_0040 utt 208.16 214.62 -X WE DEVELOP A NEURAL VOLUMETRIC METHOD TO SUPPORT LEARNING NEURAL IMPLICIT SURFACES FROM THE IMAGES.
utt_0042 utt 214.72 221.54 -X GIVEN A SAMPLE PIXEL ON THE INPUT IMAGE, WE PROJECT IT TO THE threeD SPACE TO GENERATE THE SAMPLE threeD POINTS.
utt_0044 utt 222.36 229.12 -X THEN, WE PREDICT THE SIGNED DISTANCE, THE VALIDITY PROBABILITY, AND THE RGB VALUE OF THE SAMPLED POINTS.
utt_0046 utt 229.44 238.40 -X IN THE TRAINING STAGE, THE PREDICTIONS ARE DELIVERED TO THE NEAT RENDERER TO RENDER IMAGES AND MASKS, WHICH ARE USED FOR LOSS CALCULATION.
utt_0048 utt 238.94 247.62 -X IN THE TESTING STAGE, WE SET SDF OF THE LOW VALIDITY POINTS TO NAN AND EXTRACT OPEN SURFACES WITH THE MARCHING CUBES ALGORITHM.
utt_0050 utt 248.29 257.06 -X TO INTRODUCE THE DETAILED DESIGN OF THE NEAT RENDERER, WE START FROM INTRODUCING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RENDERING WATERTIGHT AND OPEN SURFACES.
utt_0052 utt 257.82 261.03 -X THE FIRST DIFFERENCE IS THE RENDERING OF BACK FACES.
utt_0053 utt 261.12 270.34 -X CONVENTIONAL SDF-BASED APPROACHES DO NOT CONSIDER THE BACK FACES, BUT THIS APPROACH WILL RESULT IN EMPTY RENDERING IN THE BACK CAMERAS.
utt_0055 utt 270.69 275.33 -X TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE RENDER EACH POINT WITH RAY INTERSECTION.
utt_0056 utt 275.90 283.30 -X THE SECOND DIFFERENCE IS THE DEFINITION OF INSIDE AND OUTSIDE, WHICH DO NOT EXIST FOR NON-WATERTIGHT SURFACES.
utt_0058 utt 283.74 288.16 -X WE LEVERAGE THE LOCAL SURFACE NORMAL TO DETERMINE THE SIGN OF THE DISTANCE.
utt_0059 utt 288.64 294.95 -X WE EXPECT THAT THE RENDERING BEHAVES THE SAME WHEN THE RAY CROSSES A SURFACE FROM EITHER DIRECTION.
utt_0061 utt 295.52 306.28 -X IN THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION, WE MODIFY THE SDF VALUE BY FLIPPING ITS SIGNED IN THE REGIONS WHERE THE SDF VALUES INCREASES ALONG THE CAMERA RAY.
utt_0063 utt 307.20 311.78 -X THEN WE COULD DEVELOP THE OPACITY FROM THE PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION.
utt_0064 utt 311.78 318.06 -X THE SURFACE OPACITY IS THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE SDF OPACITY AND THE VALIDITY PROBABILITY.
utt_0065 utt 318.24 322.60 -X IN THIS WAY WE AVOID RENDERING THE SURFACES THAT DO NOT EXIST.
utt_0066 utt 323.52 327.50 -X WE SUPERVISE THE TRAINING OF NEAT-NET WITH FIVE LOSSES.
utt_0067 utt 327.78 335.53 -X EXCEPT FOR THE COMMONLY USED RGB LOSS, MASK LOSS AND EIKONAL LOSS, WE ADDITIONALLY ADDED TWO REGULARIZATIONS.
utt_0069 utt 335.65 346.99 -X THE VALIDITY REGULARIZATION ACCOUNTS FOR THE BINARY EXISTENCE OF THE SURFACES WHILE THE SPARSITY REGULARIZATION PREVENTS REDUNDANT SURFACE PREDICTION FOR OPEN STRUCTURES.
utt_0071 utt 347.56 350.70 -X WE VALIDATE NEAT USING THREE EXPERIMENTS.
utt_0072 utt 351.11 356.01 -X WE FIRST CONDUCT MULTI-VIEW RECONSTRUCTION FOR REAL-WORLD WATERTIGHT OBJECTS.
utt_0073 utt 356.01 362.03 -X THE RESULTS RECONSTRUCTED WITH OUR METHOD SHOW COMPARABLE QUALITY COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART.
utt_0075 utt 362.03 374.22 -X SECOND, WE RECONSTRUCT OPEN SURFACES FROM MULTIPLE IMAGES WE RUN THIS EXPERIMENT ON THE MULTI-GARMENT NET DATASET AND DEEP FASHIONS threeD DATA SET.
utt_0077 utt 374.76 378.16 -X NEAT GENERALLY PROVIDES LOWER NUMERICAL ERRORS.
utt_0078 utt 378.25 385.93 -X ALSO, NEAT IS ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT HIGH-FIDELITY DETAILS WITH CONSISTENT NORMALS LIKE THE THIN STRIPS OF THE TOPS.
utt_0080 utt 387.56 399.34 -X FINALLY WE RECONSTRUCT AN AUTOENCODER WHICH TAKES A SINGLE IMAGE AS INPUT, AND PROVIDES VALIDATION OF THE CHALLENGING TASK OF SINGLE VIEW RECONSTRUCTION ON OPEN SURFACES.
utt_0082 utt 399.34 405.90 -X THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT OUR METHOD CAN INFER ACCURATE threeD SHAPES FROM SINGLE VIEW IMAGES.
utt_0084 utt 406.70 409.49 -X WE CONDUCT TWO ABLATION EXPERIMENTS.
utt_0085 utt 409.49 415.55 -X THE FIRST ABLATION SHOWS THAT THE REGULARIZATIONS ABOUT VALIDITY HELPS ON REDUCING NOISE FACES
utt_0086 utt 415.82 418.48 -X AND REDUNDANT SURFACES IN THE OUTPUT.
utt_0087 utt 418.73 423.73 -X THE SECOND ABLATION EXPLORES THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH DIFFERENT NUMBER OF VIEWS.
utt_0088 utt 424.01 432.85 -X THE RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY IMPROVES WITH THE INCREASE OF VIEWS, BUT NEAT CAN STILL RECONSTRUCT OPEN SURFACES EVEN WITH SPARSE VIEWS.
utt_0090 utt 433.55 437.01 -X THERE ARE TWO LIMITATIONS WITH THE CURRENT METHOD.
utt_0091 utt 437.10 446.64 -X THE FIRST LIMITATION IS THAT EMPTY SPACE AROUND COLLAR IS MISTAKENLY CONNECTED TO THE MAIN BODY DUE TO LIMITED INPUT VIEWS AND OCCLUSIONS.
utt_0093 utt 446.96 452.85 -X THE SECOND LIMITATION IS THAT NEAT HAVE DIFFICULTY IN RECONSTRUCTING VERY THIN CLOSED SURFACES
utt_0094 utt 453.10 455.12 -X LIKE THE UMBRELLA STRETCHES.
utt_0095 utt 456.11 466.99 -X TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS, FUTURE WORK COULD INVOLVE INTRODUCING MORE ADVANCED ADAPTIVE SAMPLING AND WEIGHTING MECHANISMS FOR RECONSTRUCTING COMPLEX STRUCTURES.
utt_0097 utt 467.25 474.74 -X ADDITIONALLY, IT COULD BE PROMISING TO EXPLORE WAYS OF HANDLING IN THE WILD IMAGES WITHOUT CAMERA PARAMETERS.
utt_0099 utt 475.44 476.98 -X THANKS FOR WATCHING!
