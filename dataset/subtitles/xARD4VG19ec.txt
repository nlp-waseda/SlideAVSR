utt_0000 utt 1.13 11.79 -X HI EVERYONE THIS IS ZIHAO XU. TODAY I'M GOING TO PRESENT OUR WORK: DOMAIN-INDEXING VARIATIONAL BAYES: INTERPRETABLE DOMAIN INDEX FOR DOMAIN ADAPTATION.
utt_0002 utt 11.79 25.17 -X THIS IS A JOINT WORK WITH GUANG-YUAN HAO, HAO HE AND HAO WANG. DOMAIN ADAPTATION MAINLY ADDRESSES THE CROSS-DOMAIN GENERALIZATION PROBLEMS IN MACHINE LEARNING MODELS. TYPICALLY WE'LL ASSUME
utt_0004 utt 25.17 31.67 -X THAT IN THE SOURCE DOMAINS WE HAVE SOURCE DATA X_S AND SOURCE LABELS Y_S. IN TARGET DOMAINS
utt_0005 utt 31.67 41.07 -X WE ONLY HAVE TARGET DATA X_T. OUR GOAL IS TO PREDICT TARGET LABELS Y_T WITHIN TARGET DOMAINS.
utt_0006 utt 41.07 52.95 -X RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT USING DOMAIN INDICES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST THE DOMAIN ADAPTATION PERFORMANCE. TO FULLY APPRECIATE THE MAGIC OF DOMAIN INDICES, WE SHOULD FIRST
utt_0008 utt 52.95 60.75 -X UNDERSTAND: WHAT ARE DOMAIN INDICES? IN GENERAL, A DOMAIN INDEX MUST MEET THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:
utt_0009 utt 61.26 67.99 -X FIRST, IT IS A REAL VALUE SCALAR OR VECTOR SECOND, IT MUST UNIQUELY IDENTIFY A DOMAIN.
utt_0010 utt 68.40 71.19 -X DIFFERENT DOMAINS SHOULD HAVE DIFFERENT DOMAIN INDICES
utt_0011 utt 71.57 77.17 -X AND FINALLY IT SHOULD REPRESENT THE DOMAIN SEMANTICS, MUCH LIKE A WORD EMBEDDING. THE
utt_0012 utt 77.84 83.19 -X DISTANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT DOMAIN INDICES SHOULD INDICATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS.
utt_0013 utt 85.30 90.45 -X TO ILLUSTRATE THE CONCEPT OF DOMAIN INDICES, LET'S CONSIDER A GENDER CLASSIFICATION TASK.
utt_0014 utt 90.90 94.90 -X IN THIS TASK, WE AIM TO CLASSIFY GENDER BASED ON FACE SHOTS.
utt_0015 utt 95.41 99.60 -X WE HAVE TWO SOURCE DOMAINS, WHICH MAINLY CONSIST OF YOUNG PEOPLE,
utt_0016 utt 99.63 111.51 -X AND TWO TARGET DOMAINS WHICH MAINLY CONSIST OF OLDER PEOPLE. IN THIS CASE WE CAN USE THE AVERAGE AGE AS THE DOMAIN INDEX. IT SATISFIES ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF DOMAIN INDEX:
utt_0018 utt 111.89 117.75 -X IT IS A REAL VALUE SCALAR, UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES THE DOMAIN, AND REPRESENTS DOMAIN SEMANTICS.
utt_0019 utt 119.38 123.70 -X WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATE HOW TO USE DOMAIN INDEX TO IMPROVE DOMAIN ADAPTATION.
utt_0020 utt 124.11 137.78 -X I WILL TAKE CONTINUOUSLY INDEXED DOMAIN ADAPTATION AS AN EXAMPLE. IT MAINLY USES DOMAIN INDICES IN TWO KEY AREAS. FIRST, IT TAKES DOMAIN INDICES AS THE INPUT OF THE ENCODER. SECOND, THE
utt_0022 utt 137.78 149.49 -X DISCRIMINATOR AND THE ENCODER PLAY A MIN-MAX GAME CENTERED ON THE DOMAIN INDICES. THE DISCRIMINATOR TRIES TO PREDICT THE DOMAIN INDICES BETA BASED ON THE MIDDLE FEATURE Z, WHILE THE ENCODER TRIES
utt_0024 utt 149.49 153.69 -X TO FOOL THE DISCRIMINATOR BY REMOVING ALL DOMAIN-RELATED INFORMATION IN THE FEATURE.
utt_0025 utt 154.42 159.83 -X THIS MIN-MAX GAME ENFORCES THE INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE DOMAIN INDICES AND THE FEATURE,
utt_0026 utt 159.96 166.01 -X WHICH MAKES THE FEATURE DOMAIN-INVARIANT, AND THUS IMPROVES THE DOMAIN ADAPTATION PERFORMANCE.
utt_0027 utt 168.63 173.46 -X SO FAR, WE HAVE EXPLORED HOW TO USE DOMAIN INDICES IN DOMAIN ADAPTATION.
utt_0028 utt 173.46 187.58 -X HOWEVER, THERE IS A CHALLENGE: DOMAIN INDICES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. THIS SEVERELY LIMITS THE APPLICATION OF SUCH INDEXED DOMAIN ADAPTATION METHOD. A NATURAL QUESTION IS MOTIVATED:
utt_0030 utt 188.24 194.71 -X CAN WE INFER THE DOMAIN INDICES DIRECTLY FROM DATA? AND THE ANSWER IS: YES.
utt_0031 utt 196.88 211.24 -X THERE ARE TWO MAJOR ADVANTAGES OF INFERRING DOMAIN INDICES. FIRST, IT IMPROVES INTERPRETABILITY OF DOMAIN ADAPTATION. THIS IS BECAUSE DOMAIN INDICES CAN SHED LIGHT ON THE DOMAIN RELATIONSHIP. DOMAINS
utt_0033 utt 211.24 223.58 -X WITH SIMILAR DOMAIN INDICES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SHARE SIMILAR DATA DISTRIBUTION. SECOND, IT CAN ALSO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF DOMAIN ADAPTATION. BY IDENTIFYING THE DOMAIN RELATIONSHIPS, THE MODEL
utt_0035 utt 223.58 229.05 -X CAN BETTER ADAPT ITSELF TO UNSEEN DOMAINS, RESULTING IN OVERALL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT.
utt_0036 utt 231.38 244.19 -X WE HAVE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE ADVANTAGES OF INFERRING DOMAIN INDICES. THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW TO INFER THE DOMAIN INDICES. WE PROPOSE OUR SOLUTION HERE, WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO
utt_0038 utt 244.19 252.64 -X STEPS. FIRST, WE WILL RIGOROUSLY DEFINE WHAT IS THE DOMAIN INDEX. SECOND, BASED ON OUR DEFINITION,
utt_0039 utt 252.64 258.14 -X WE WILL USE A PROBABILISTIC GRAPHING MODEL (PGM) TO INFER THE DOMAIN INDEX.
utt_0040 utt 258.14 263.52 -X LET'S FIRST EXPLORE THE DEFINITION. WE LIST THE DEFINITION AS FOLLOWS:
utt_0041 utt 263.52 277.31 -X FIRST, A DOMAIN INDEX SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT OF THE DATA ENCODING Z. SECOND, IT MUST RETAIN AS MUCH INFORMATION ON THE DATA X AS POSSIBLE. FINALLY, IT SHOULD MAXIMIZE ADAPTATION PERFORMANCE. WE
utt_0043 utt 277.31 284.22 -X SUMMARIZE THE THREE REQUIREMENTS AS INDEPENDENCE, INFORMATION PRESERVATION, AND LABEL SENSITIVITY.
utt_0044 utt 286.49 288.99 -X WITH THE RIGOROUS DEFINITION OF DOMAIN INDICES,
utt_0045 utt 288.99 292.45 -X THE NEXT STEP IS TO INFER THE DOMAIN INDICES WITH PGM.
utt_0046 utt 292.99 300.61 -X THE GENERATION PROCESS OF OUR PGM CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS FOLLOWS:
utt_0047 utt 301.37 309.02 -X SUPPOSE WE HAVE N DOMAINS IN TOTAL. FIRST, WE WILL USE THE PRIOR TO GENERATE GLOBAL DOMAIN INDICES.
utt_0048 utt 309.53 313.98 -X THIS IS ONE PER DOMAIN, WHERE K REFERS TO THE DOMAIN ID.
utt_0049 utt 314.94 320.99 -X NEXT, USING THE GLOBAL DOMAIN INDICES, WE GENERATE LOCAL DOMAIN INDICES, WHICH IS ONE PER DATUM.
utt_0050 utt 321.50 328.13 -X SUPPOSE IN DOMAIN K, WE HAVE D_K DATA POINTS THEN, WE WILL HAVE D_K LOCAL DOMAIN INDICES.
utt_0051 utt 329.79 342.96 -X WE THEN USE THESE LOCAL DOMAIN INDICES TO GENERATE THE OBSERVED DATA, SUCH AS AN IMAGE.TO PROVIDE SOME INTUITION ABOUT THIS GENERATION PROCESS, I WILL TAKE THE GENDER CLASSIFICATION
utt_0053 utt 342.96 354.91 -X TASK AS AN EXAMPLE AGAIN. WE BEGIN BY GENERATING THE GLOBAL DOMAIN INDICES, SUCH AS THE AVERAGE AGE. THEN WE PRODUCE THE LOCAL DOMAIN INDICES, WHICH IS THE AGE FOR EACH FACE SHOT.
utt_0055 utt 355.93 365.89 -X BASED ON THESE AGES, WE GENERATE THE OBSERVED DATA. THE REASON FOR USING THIS HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE IS THAT IT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BOOST THE LEARNING EFFICIENCY
utt_0057 utt 368.54 372.83 -X WITH GLOBAL AND LOCAL DOMAIN INDICES, AS WELL AS THE OBSERVED DATA,
utt_0058 utt 372.96 378.18 -X WE PROCEED TO GENERATE THE FEATURE EMBEDDING Z, WHICH IS DOMAIN-VARIANT.
utt_0059 utt 378.18 384.16 -X NOTE THAT THE DASHED LINE HERE MEANS BETA AND Z SHOULD BE INDEPENDENT.
utt_0060 utt 384.16 388.80 -X FINALLY, WE GENERATE THE LABELS FOR THE OBSERVED DATA BASED ON THE FEATURE EMBEDDING.
utt_0061 utt 391.04 394.79 -X WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED THE INFERENCE MODEL SHOWN IN THE RIGHT FIGURE.
utt_0062 utt 395.07 400.55 -X NOW, THE GENERATING MODEL AND THE INFERENCE MODEL TOGETHER, CONSTITUTE THE COMPLETE FRAMEWORK.
utt_0063 utt 402.27 415.33 -X THE PGM IS NOW ESTABLISHED, AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO OPTIMIZE THIS MODEL. TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE WILL MAXIMIZE THE EVIDENCE LOWER BOUND (ELBO). THIS WOULD MAXIMIZE THE LOG LIKELIHOOD OF THE OBSERVED
utt_0065 utt 415.33 422.08 -X DATA AND LABELS. HOWEVER, SOLELY RELYING ON THE ELBO CANNOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED DOMAIN INDICES.
utt_0066 utt 422.53 435.94 -X RECALL THAT OUR DOMAIN INDEX REQUIRES ITSELF TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE DATA'S ENCODING Z, WHICH CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY THE ELBO ALONE. THEREFORE, WE INCORPORATE AN ADVERSARIAL LOSS TO ENSURE THAT
utt_0068 utt 435.94 449.70 -X BETA AND Z ARE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. OUR FINAL OBJECTIVE FUNCTION COMBINES THE PREVIOUS TWO LOSSES, THE ELBO AND THE ADVERSARIAL LOSS. WE HAVE PROVED THAT BY USING THIS OBJECTIVE FUNCTION,
utt_0070 utt 449.86 463.30 -X WE COULD LEARN DOMAIN INDICES BETA ACCORDING TO THE PREVIOUS DEFINITION. SPECIFICALLY, THE INFERRED DOMAIN INDICES WILL SATISFY INDEPENDENCE, INFORMATION PRESERVATION, AND LABEL SENSITIVITY.
utt_0072 utt 465.15 477.83 -X THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ALSO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MODEL. WE WILL USE EXPERIMENTS ON TPTminus forty-eight AS AN EXAMPLE. TPTminus forty-eight IS A REAL-WORLD DATASET THAT CONTAINS MONTHLY AVERAGE
utt_0074 utt 477.83 491.03 -X TEMPERATURE FOR THE forty-eight CONTIGUOUS STATES IN THE U.S. ON THIS DATASET, WE WILL FOCUS ON TRANSFERRING THE TEMPERATURE PREDICTION MODEL. ONE OF OUR DOMAIN ADAPTATION TASKS IS FORMULATED AS
utt_0076 utt 491.81 504.90 -X NORTH twenty-four TO SOUTH twenty-four, WHICH IS ADAPTIVE MODELS FROM twenty-four STATES IN THE NORTH TO twenty-four STATES IN THE SOUTH. WE ALSO DIVIDE THE TARGET DOMAINS INTO THREE LEVELS TO REPORT FINER-GRAINED RESULTS.
utt_0078 utt 506.79 518.89 -X LET'S FIRST SEE THE VISUALIZATION OF INFERRED DOMAIN INDICES. HERE, THE COLORS INDICATE EACH STATE'S LATITUDE. WE OBSERVE THAT WHEN TWO STATES HAVE SIMILAR LATITUDE, THEIR DOMAIN
utt_0080 utt 518.89 525.58 -X INDICES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CLOSE ALONG THE X-DIMENSION, SUCH AS NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY.
utt_0081 utt 526.79 531.11 -X IN CONTRAST, WHEN TWO STATES' LATITUDE ARE QUIET DISTINCT FROM EACH OTHER,
utt_0082 utt 531.11 536.81 -X THEIR DOMAIN INDICES ARE FURTHER APART ON THE X-DIMENSION, AS SEEN FROM FLORIDA AND NEW JERSEY.
utt_0083 utt 537.28 549.06 -X IN FACT, A CORRELATION CAN BE DRAWN BETWEEN THE LATITUDE AND THE X-DIMENSION OF THE DOMAIN INDICES. THIS IS REASONABLE BECAUSE TEMPERATURE IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE LATITUDE OF THE STATE.
utt_0085 utt 549.64 564.17 -X NOTICE THAT WE NEVER USE LATITUDE INFORMATION AS INPUT. THIS MEANS OUR MODEL TRULY LEARNS USEFUL DOMAIN INDICES DURING THE ADAPTATION. WE ALSO REPORT NUMERICAL RESULTS ON THIS TASK. OUR MODEL
utt_0087 utt 564.17 569.45 -X ACHIEVES SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN BOTH OVERALL EVALUATION AND THE FINER-GRAINED EVALUATIONS.
utt_0088 utt 570.63 575.18 -X TO SUMMARIZE, OUR TAKE-HOME MESSAGES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
utt_0089 utt 575.18 586.35 -X VDI PROVIDES A PRINCIPLED WAY TO INFER DOMAIN INDICES. IT IMPROVES BOTH INTERPRETABILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF DOMAIN ADAPTATION, AND IT HAS THEORETICAL GUARANTEES.
