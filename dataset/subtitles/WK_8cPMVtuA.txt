utt_0000 utt 0.29 9.78 -X HI I'M ZHUOHAO ZHANG AND TODAY I'LL BE PRESENTING OUR WORK COLLABALLY, A SYSTEM THAT AIMS TO MAKE COLLABORATION AWARENESS ACCESSIBLE IN DOCUMENT EDITING
utt_0004 utt 9.96 12.21 -X HERE I ALSO SPEAK FOR MY CO-AUTHORS
utt_0005 utt 12.30 15.34 -X CHEUK YIN PHIPSON LEE, JAYLIN HERSKOVITZ,
utt_0006 utt 15.40 17.55 -X JOOYOUNG SEO AND ANHONG GUO
utt_0007 utt 18.80 24.79 -X COLLABORATIVE DOCUMENT EDITING USUALLY CONSISTS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT OTHER COLLABORATORS ARE DOING IN THE DOCUMENT
utt_0010 utt 25.26 27.43 -X READING AND RESPONDING TO COMMENTS
utt_0011 utt 27.98 30.85 -X AS WELL AS TRACKING AND MAKING TEXT EDITS
utt_0013 utt 32.49 40.51 -X HOWEVER COLLABORATIVE EDITING IS CHALLENGING FOR BLIND USERS WHO USUALLY LACK THE UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT VISUAL CUES IN A DOCUMENT
utt_0017 utt 40.72 49.38 -X STRUGGLE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AND HAVE VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO AUTOMATIC REAL-TIME UPDATES ABOUT THE COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES
utt_0021 utt 49.90 51.73 -X TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES
utt_0022 utt 51.95 61.01 -X WE CONDUCTED A CO-DESIGN STUDY WITH OUR BLIND CO-AUTHOR JOOYOUNG TO BUILD COLLABALLY UPON A COMMON COLLABORATIVE EDITING TOOL GOOGLE DOCS
utt_0026 utt 61.46 66.64 -X WE CO-DESIGNED COLLABALLY OVER THREE SESSIONS AND ACHIEVED TWO PRIMARY GOALS:
utt_0028 utt 66.90 72.95 -X TO UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT PRACTICES AND CHALLENGES THAT SCREEN READER USERS HAVE IN COLLABORATIVE EDITING
utt_0031 utt 73.46 76.37 -X AND TO INFORM SYSTEM ITERATION IN THE NEXT STAGE
utt_0033 utt 77.81 82.61 -X AFTER ITERATION COLLABORATION USES A THREE-LAYER MODEL TO FIRST
utt_0035 utt 82.87 86.07 -X EXTRACT THE STATE OF THE COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT
utt_0037 utt 86.32 97.17 -X SECOND IDENTIFY AND REPRESENT KEY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND FINALLY PRESENT IT TO BLIND USERS IN AN ACCESSIBLE AND UNDERSTANDABLE MANNER
utt_0042 utt 98.19 103.83 -X TO EXTRACT A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT WE FIRST FETCH THE DOM STRUCTURE OF THE GOOGLE DOCS
utt_0045 utt 104.08 106.73 -X USING BOTH A FRONT-END BROWSER EXTENSION
utt_0046 utt 106.77 108.26 -X AND A BACK-END SERVER
utt_0047 utt 109.62 112.63 -X FROM THERE WE IDENTIFY CLASSES AND HTML
utt_0048 utt 112.82 120.57 -X ELEMENTS IN THE DOCUMENT THAT CAN BE USED TO REPRESENT COLLABORATORS BEHAVIORS COMMENT UPDATES AND TEXT CHANGES
utt_0052 utt 121.46 126.30 -X FINALLY WE PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO BLIND USERS IN REAL TIME USING EARCONS
utt_0054 utt 126.52 135.96 -X AND DESIGNED A DIALOG BOX INTERFACE THROUGH WHICH BLIND USERS CAN NAVIGATE AND ACCESS COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES USING KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS AND SCREEN READER COMMANDS
utt_0059 utt 136.76 146.54 -X WE ALSO INCORPORATED SPATIAL AUDIO AND VOICE FONTS TO FURTHER CONTEXTUALIZE WHO WHERE AND WHEN CERTAIN COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES TOOK PLACE IN THE DOCUMENT
utt_0063 utt 147.00 155.75 -X TO DEMONSTRATE HOW COLLABALLY WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD SCENARIO OUR CO-AUTHOR JOOYOUNG USES COLLABALLY TO REVIEW AND EDIT ONE OF OUR STUDY MATERIALS
utt_0067 utt 156.57 160.36 -X FIRST TWO COLLABORATORS SHOWED UP IN THE DOCUMENT AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
utt_0069 utt 161.01 165.82 -X TODAY I'M GOING TO GO OVER THE STUDY MATERIAL WE USE AND RESOLVE SOME COMMENTS
utt_0072 utt 165.97 171.96 -X FIRST OF ALL I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER COLLABORATORS ON OUR TEAM THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT DOCUMENT WITH ME

utt_0115 utt 305.98 308.53 -X THERE IS ONLY ONE TEXT CHANGE
utt_0116 utt 312.16 315.83 -X AND THREE STYLE CHANGES THE SECOND CHANGES
utt_0118 utt 316.19 317.64 -X CHANGE IS ABOUT
utt_0119 utt 320.70 323.33 -X TEXT MODIFICATION FROM SENSE MAKING
utt_0121 utt 325.12 327.91 -X TO TRACKING OF COLLAB ONLINE
utt_0122 utt 330.24 344.97 -X TO EVALUATE COLLABALLY WE RAN A USER STUDY WITH eleven BLIND AND LOW VISION USERS WHO WERE UNABLE TO READ ANY SCRIPT WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF COLLABORATIVE EDITING TASKS USING EITHER GOOGLE DOCS ACCESSIBILITY
utt_0128 utt 344.97 346.47 -X SETTINGS OR COLLABALLY
utt_0129 utt 346.88 356.58 -X THE TASKS INCLUDED THE THREE MAIN COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES WE DEFINED WHICH ARE LOCATING COLLABORATORS, WORKING WITH COMMENTS, IDENTIFYING TEXT CHANGES,
utt_0133 utt 356.58 363.33 -X AND ONE FREE FORM WRITING TASK IN WHICH WE ASK PARTICIPANTS TO ANSWER A FEW OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS FREELY
utt_0136 utt 363.84 374.82 -X TWO RESULTS FROM PARTICIPANTS WHO USE GOOGLE DOCS CONFIRMED OUR FINDINGS ON BLIND PEOPLE'S CURRENT PRACTICES AND CHALLENGES AND THE OTHER NINE RESULTS REPORTED COLLABORATIVE USABILITY
utt_0141 utt 376.00 385.90 -X WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO RATE THE LEVEL OF EASINESS USING COLLABALLY TO COMPLETE THE TASKS AND HELPFULNESS OF COLLABALLY'S INFORMATION PROVIDED AFTER EACH TASK
utt_0146 utt 386.24 397.59 -X AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST PARTICIPANTS AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT IT WAS EASY TO COMPLETE THE EDITING TASKS USING COLLABALLY AND THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN IT WAS USEFUL
utt_0151 utt 398.31 412.73 -X FROM THEIR FEEDBACK WE SUMMARIZED THE MOST LIKED FEATURES OF COLLABALLY INCLUDING DEEP INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING TOOL EASY NAVIGATION SONIFICATION WITH SPATIAL FEATURES AND FITS INTO USERS CURRENT WORKFLOW
utt_0157 utt 412.97 424.60 -X WE ALSO SUMMARIZED SUGGESTIONS FROM PARTICIPANTS THEY WANTED TO HAVE AUDIO CUSTOMIZATION DIRECT COPY AND SEARCH NAVIGATION BY CLICKING AND BETTER INTEGRATION WITH SCREEN READERS LIKE
utt_0162 utt 424.71 425.93 -X NVDA AND JAWS
utt_0163 utt 427.01 441.69 -X IN THE NEXT PHASE WE PLAN TO BETTER INTEGRATE OUR SYSTEM WITH THE CURRENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEM AND EXTEND IT IN DIFFERENT LAYERS INCLUDING EXPLORING OTHER NON-SPEECH AUDIOS, BUILD UPON OTHER SCREEN READERS, AND CONSIDER
utt_0169 utt 441.69 444.43 -X OTHER COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENTS BEYOND DOCUMENT EDITING
utt_0171 utt 445.51 458.60 -X THROUGH OUR RESEARCH WE DEMONSTRATE THAT COLLABALLY PROVIDES IMPROVED ACCESS TO COLLABORATION AWARENESS BY CENTRALIZING SCATTERED INFORMATION, SONIFYING VISUAL INFORMATION, AND SIMPLIFYING COMPLEX OPERATIONS
utt_0177 utt 459.02 471.01 -X WE ENVISIONED THAT WITH COLLABALLY MANY EXISTING COLLABORATIVE EDITING TOOLS CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED TO PROVIDE BETTER COLLABORATIVE AWARENESS AND ACCESSIBILITY SUPPORT FOR BLIND USERS
utt_0182 utt 471.11 472.41 -4.8667 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
