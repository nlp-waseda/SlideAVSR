utt_0000 utt 0.37 13.52 -X HI I'M ABDULLAH HAMDI AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT OUR ICCV PAPER MVTN: MULTIVIEW TRANSFORMATION NETWORK FOR threeD SHAPE RECOGNITION THIS WORK IS FROM OUR IVAL GROUP AT KAUST LED BY DR BERNARD GHANEM.
utt_0002 utt 14.19 24.16 -X threeD POINT CLOUDS ARE WIDELY USED FOR threeD REPRESENTATION IN COMPUTER VISION DUE TO COMPACTNESS FLEXIBILITY AND BECAUSE THEY COME NATURALLY FROM SENSORS LIKE LIDAR AND RGBD CAMERAS
utt_0004 utt 24.75 37.97 -X ON THE OTHER HAND HUMANS DON'T HAVE threeD SENSORS WE ARE NATURALLY LOOKING INTO OBJECTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES WE RELY ON THE IMAGES PROJECTED TO OUR EYES TO IDENTIFY THE threeD WORLD
utt_0006 utt 39.79 45.97 -X MULTI-VIEW APPROACHES ARE THE OLDEST FORM OF DEEP LEARNING FOR threeD UNDERSTANDING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF MVCNN IN two thousand and fifteen.
utt_0008 utt 46.19 60.18 -X THE BENEFITS OF MULTIVIEW AT THE TIME WERE CLEAR LEVERAGING THE twoD COMPUTER VISION ARCHITECTURES AND METHODS LIKE CNNS LEVERAGING LARGE LABELED AND DIVERSE twoD IMAGE DATASETS LIKE IMAGENET AND
utt_0010 utt 60.18 72.90 -X PROVIDING A SIMPLE threeD PROCESSING PIPELINE A LINE OF WORKS CONTINUED THE DEVELOPMENT ON MULTIVIEW LIKE ROTATIONNET AND MOST RECENTLY VIEWGCN WHICH WE USED IN THIS WORK BUT THESE METHODS
utt_0012 utt 72.90 79.04 -X USE HEURISTIC APPROACHES FOR SELECTING FIXED VIEWS AND MOSTLY RELY ON PRE-RENDERED IMAGE DATA SETS
utt_0013 utt 80.46 84.13 -X SUCH HEURISTICS MAY NOT BE OPTIMAL TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE RESULTS
utt_0014 utt 84.56 97.70 -X WE AIM TO DO A DYNAMIC SETUP RELYING ON ONLINE RENDERING TO ENHANCE DOWNSTREAM TASKS BY LEARNING TO REGRESS VIEWPOINTS ADAPTIVELY FOR EACH SHAPE ACTUALLY THIS ACTIVE SETUP IS HOW
utt_0016 utt 97.70 102.68 -X CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT OBJECTS BY CHANGING THE VIEWPOINTS AND INTERACTING WITH THE threeD WORLD
utt_0017 utt 104.59 117.25 -X OUR MVTN IS TRAINED END-TO-END WITH THE MULTI-VIEW NETWORK WITHOUT EXTRA SUPERVISION THIS IS THE MVTN PIPELINE IT CONSISTS OF A DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERER R THAT RENDERED THE OBJECT S
utt_0019 utt 117.25 129.94 -X ACCORDING TO SOME SCENE PARAMETERS U TO GET THE MULTIVIEW IMAGES X THE GOAL OF MVTN IS TO PREDICT THE PARAMETERS U WHICH ARE THE AZIMUTH ANNOTATION ANGLES IN THIS WORK FOR EVERY OBJECT
utt_0021 utt 129.94 143.03 -X S WE EXTRACT COURSE FEATURES FROM THE OBJECT AND LEARN AN MLP TO PREDICT THE SCENE PARAMETERS THE PIPELINE IS TRAINED INTO END WITHOUT IN WITH ONLY THE TASK LAWS WHICH IS CROSS ENTROPY FOR
utt_0023 utt 143.03 156.19 -X CLASSIFICATION HERE WE SHOW HOW THESE LEARNED VIEWPOINTS FOR THE CAR OBJECT DIFFER FROM FIXED CIRCULAR OR SPHERICAL VIEWPOINTS WE USED PYTORCH threeD FOR BOTH DIFFERENTIABLE MACHINERY WHEN MESH
utt_0025 utt 156.19 161.08 -X DATA IS AVAILABLE AND DIFFERENTIABLE POINT CLOUD RENDERING WHEN ONLY threeD POINT CLOUDS ARE AVAILABLE
utt_0026 utt 161.53 172.67 -X THE DATA SETS WE USED INCLUDE MODEL NETforty FOR CLASSIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL SHAPE NET CORE fifty-five FOR RETRIEVAL AND SCAN OBJECTING IN THAT CONSISTS OF REALISTIC threeD SCANS OF OBJECTS
utt_0028 utt 172.67 178.11 -X WHICH HAS THREE VARIANTS OUR MODEL NET forty RESULTS SHOW COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE
utt_0029 utt 178.52 190.01 -X THE HIGHLIGHTED SETUP SHOWS OUR IMPLEMENTATION WITH PYTHORCH threeD RENDERER WHICH SHOWS OUR MVTN ACHIEVES HIGHER OVERALL ACCURACY THAN STATE-OF-THE-ART VIEWGCN WITH ninety-three point eight PERCENT AND
utt_0031 utt 191.45 203.93 -X EVEN HIGHER THAN POINT TRANSFORMER FROM THIS ICCV ON THE REALISTIC SCAN OBJECT AND END DATASET WE ACHIEVE STATE OF THE ART ON ALL THE THREE VARIANTS WITH UP TO SIX PERCENT IMPROVEMENT IN THE CASE
utt_0033 utt 203.93 211.31 -X WHERE BACKGROUND IS COMBINED WITH THE OBJECT ON threeD SHAPE RETRIEVAL ON BOTH MODEL NET forty AND SHAPE NET
utt_0034 utt 211.58 218.40 -X CORE fifty-five MVTN SITS NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE ON BOTH DATA SETS IN TERMS OF RETRIEVAL MEAN AP
utt_0035 utt 219.67 231.73 -X HERE WE SHOW SOME QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES OF SHAPE RETRIEVAL WE ALSO EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF MVTN APPROACH TO ROTATION BY RANDOMLY ROTATING THE OBJECT IN TEST TIME AROUND GRAVITY AXIS
utt_0037 utt 232.70 237.90 -X MVTN PERFORMS BETTER THAN STRONG BASELINE SPECIALIZED TO THIS TASK OF ROTATION ROBUSTNESS
utt_0038 utt 238.17 249.82 -X ANOTHER ROBUSTNESS ASPECT TO STUDYING IS THE OCCLUSION WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT AFFECTS SCANNED DATA TO SIMULATE OCCLUSION WE CROP THE OBJECT FROM ITS SIX FACES WITH
utt_0040 utt 249.82 254.37 -X DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES ZERO TO SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT AND FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
utt_0041 utt 255.10 265.07 -X HERE WE SHOW HOW THE OBJECTS ARE AFFECTED BY CROPPING THEM WITH DIFFERENT OCCLUSION RATIOS AND FROM FOUR DIFFERENT CANONICAL DIRECTIONS THESE OCCLUSIONS ARE INTRODUCED IN TEST TIME
utt_0043 utt 265.98 274.53 -X HERE WE SHOW THE AVERAGE TEST ACCURACY IN MODERN NET forty OVER THE SIX CANONICAL OCCLUSION DIRECTIONS PLUS MINUS X PLUS MINUS Y AND PLUS MINUS Z
utt_0045 utt 274.68 280.74 -X FOR DIFFERENT OCCLUSION RATIOS MVTN SHOWS MORE ROBUSTNESS IN THIS SETUP THAN THE BASELINES
utt_0046 utt 282.78 294.15 -X WE CAN PLOT THE TEST ACCURACY VERSUS THE NUMBER OF VIEWS USED IN TRAINING MVCNN USING THE LEARNED MVTN VIEWS ACHIEVE CONSISTENT TWO PERCENT IMPROVEMENT OVER FIXED OR RANDOM BASELINES ACROSS
utt_0048 utt 294.15 298.91 -2.6815 MULTIPLE NUMBER OF VIEWS PLEASE CHECK THE PAPER AND CODE FOR MORE DETAILS THANK YOU
