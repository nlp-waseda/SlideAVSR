utt_0000 utt 0.52 10.32 -X HELLO, MY NAME IS GEORG KOHL AND IN THIS VIDEO I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT OUR PAPER LEARNING SIMILARITY METRICS FOR VOLUMETRIC SIMULATIONS WITH MULTISCALE CNNS.
utt_0002 utt 10.67 23.44 -X THIS WAS JOINT WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES LI-WEI CHEN AND NILS THUEREY. TO START, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A QUICK MOTIVATION, AND SUMMARIZE THE TASK WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE WITH THIS PROJECT. WE ARE LOOKING
utt_0004 utt 23.44 28.72 -X AT THE SIMILARITY ASSESSMENT OF DENSE threeD GRID DATA AS IT OCCURS FROM TRANSPORT AND MOTION-BASED PDES.
utt_0005 utt 29.33 41.78 -X THESE PDES TEND TO BE VERY RELEVANT IN THE AREA OF FLUID FLOWS, FOR EXAMPLE FOR TURBULENCE, LIQUID OR SMOKE SIMULATIONS. COMMON METHODS TO APPROACH THIS PROBLEM ARE ELEMENT-WISE L^P DISTANCES,
utt_0007 utt 42.35 48.56 -X WHICH ARE INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC AS THEY CANNOT CAPTURE SPATIAL STRUCTURES OR PATTERNS.
utt_0008 utt 49.07 60.24 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LOOK AT A CHECKERBOARD PATTERN AND COMPARE IT TO ANOTHER CHECKERBOARD PATTERN WHICH IS SLIDED OVER BY ONE VOXEL, YOU GET AN EXTREMELY HIGH ELEMENT-WISE DISTANCE,
utt_0010 utt 60.24 65.11 -X EVEN THOUGH THE GENERAL STRUCTURE - THAT BOTH ARE A CHECKERBOARD PATTERN - IS VERY, VERY SIMILAR.
utt_0011 utt 65.71 70.52 -X TO SUMMARIZE, WE WOULD LIKE TO UTILIZE DEEP LEARNING TO COME UP WITH A ROBUST,
utt_0012 utt 70.52 77.27 -X PHYSICALLY MEANINGFUL METRIC, THAT CAN CONSIDER THESE STRUCTURES.
utt_0013 utt 77.27 87.09 -X HERE, AN OVERVIEW OVER SOME RELATED WORK: AS ALREADY MENTIONED, THE MOST COMMON ELEMENT-WISE DISTANCES ARE THE L^P DISTANCES, BUT THERE IS ALSO THE PEAK-SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO, AND THE
utt_0015 utt 87.09 99.67 -X STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY INDEX. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS THAT CAN BE USED AS A SIMILIAR APPROACH, FOR EXAMPLE THE PEARSON CORRELATION OR SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION.
utt_0017 utt 99.67 113.05 -X IN PREVIOUS WORK, UM ET AL. UTILIZED VISUAL EVALUATIONS VIA USER STUDIES FOR THIS KIND OF DATA. BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE FOR threeD DENSE GRID DATA THIS TENDS TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT, IN ADDITION TO
utt_0019 utt 113.05 125.81 -X BEING SLOW AND EXPENSIVE. IN THE DOMAIN OF IMAGES, THERE ARE VARIOUS APPROACHES WITH DIFFERENT NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURES THAT CAN SOLVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM, FOR EXAMPLE THE LPIPS METRIC.
utt_0021 utt 126.29 133.78 -X AND FINALLY, IN A PREVIOUS PAPER WE ALSO LOOKED AT A LEARNED COMPARISON OF SCALAR twoD PDE DATA,
utt_0022 utt 134.90 144.95 -X WHICH IS ALSO THE BASIS OF THIS WORK HERE. HOWEVER, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE MORE COMPLEX CASE OF threeD DATA, AND ALSO IMPROVE UPON VARIOUS OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS PREVIOUS WORK.
utt_0024 utt 146.90 151.62 -X HERE, A QUICK OVERVIEW OVER OUR METHOD: WE START OUT EITHER WITH A PDE SOLVER
utt_0025 utt 151.70 156.57 -X OR WITH A SIMULATION DATA REPOSITORY, CREATED TYPICALLY WITH A PDE SOLVER,
utt_0026 utt 157.91 170.71 -X TO CREATE A SEQUENCE OF VOLUMES. IN THIS CASE, YOU CAN ONLY SEE A twoD PROJECTION, BUT NORMALLY YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THESE ARE DENSE VOLUMES. WE WOULD LIKE TO CREATE A SEQUENCE OF THESE VOLUMES, AND ORDER
utt_0028 utt 170.71 177.56 -X THEM BASED ON A REFERENCE ON THE LEFT, AND THEN ELEMENTS WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO THE RIGHT.
utt_0029 utt 179.09 190.23 -X ONCE WE HAVE SUCH A SEQUENCE, WE CAN THE UTILIZE THE ORDER OF THIS SEQUENCE, TO COME UP WITH PAIR-WISE GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES, AS WE HAVE DONE IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK. BUT IN THIS CASE,
utt_0031 utt 190.23 199.45 -X WE ACTUALLY IMPROVE THIS WITH AN ENTROPY-BASED SIMILARITY MODEL, THAT TRANSFORMS THESE GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES, SO THAT THEY ARE MORE COMPARABLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.
utt_0033 utt 202.49 207.67 -X ONCE YOU HAVE A SQUENCE, YOU CAN THEN TAKE PAIRS OF THIS SEQUENCE AND FEED THEM INTO A
utt_0034 utt 208.25 213.88 -X SIAMESE NEURAL NETWORK, SO ESSENTIALLY SHARED WEIGHTS. IN THE LATENT SPACE OF THIS NETWORK,
utt_0035 utt 213.88 219.61 -X WE CAN COMPARE THE FEATURES OF ALL OF THESE INPUTS, AND AGGREGATE THE RESULT INTO A SCALAR,
utt_0036 utt 219.61 224.38 -X PAIR-WISE DISTANCE PREDICTION. ONCE WE HAVE THE GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES ON THE LEFT,
utt_0037 utt 224.38 237.43 -X AND THE DISTANCE PREDICTION ON THE RIGHT, WE CAN THEN DETERMINE A LOSS AND OPTIMIZE OUR NETWORK TO BE MORE ACCURATE, AND ALSO EVALUATE HOW WELL OUR NETWORK PREDICTION ACTUALLY MATCHES THE GROUND
utt_0039 utt 237.43 243.55 -X TRUTH. IN THE FOLLOWING, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS IN A BIT MORE DETAIL.
utt_0040 utt 244.66 256.54 -X TO START WITH THE SEQUENCE CREATION, ON THE LEFT WE ARE GIVEN A PDE SOLVER. THE MAIN IDEA THAT WE HAD IS THAT YOU CAN VARY THE INITIAL CONDITIONS OF YOUR SIMULATION,
utt_0042 utt 259.19 265.47 -X THE INITIAL CONDITIONS ARE DENOTED HERE BY P_I. THEN YOU CHANGE THESE WITH INCREASING STEPS OF A
utt_0043 utt 266.30 277.85 -X DELTA VALUE, AND WHEN YOU RUN THE SIMULATION SEVERAL TIMES, YOU GET A SEQUENCE OF OUTPUTS THAT TENDS TO BE LESS AND LESS SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL REFERENCE SIMULATION AS WE SEE OVER HERE.
utt_0045 utt 278.90 286.91 -X SIMILARLY IF YOU HAVE A DATA REPOSITORY, YOU CAN TAKE A CUTOUT AROUND A SPATIO-TEMPORAL STARTING
utt_0046 utt 288.60 295.25 -X POSITION P, AND ADJUST THIS CUTOUT POSITION WITH A SPATIO-TEMPORAL OFFSET. AGAIN, THE RESULT IS A
utt_0047 utt 296.35 305.12 -X SEQUENCE THAT IS DECREASINGLY, LESS AND LESS SIMILAR TO YOUR ORIGINAL, UNALTERED CUTOUT.
utt_0048 utt 305.91 314.69 -X NOTICE THAT BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES ARE AN ITERATIVE PROCESS, WE ADDED A HEURISTIC THERE,
utt_0049 utt 314.84 320.32 -X THAT ENSURE THAT OUR SEQUENCES ARE AS INFORMATIVE AS POSSIBLE, BY MAKING
utt_0050 utt 322.20 328.16 -X SURE THAT OUR VALUES OF DELTA IN BOTH OF THESE CASES, ARE NOT TOO SMALL BUT ALSO NOT TOO BIG.
utt_0051 utt 331.04 341.82 -X WITH THESE TWO METHODS, WE CAME UP WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DATA SETS. ON THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE OUR TRAINING DATA: THE MOST BASIC IS THE ADVECTION-DIFFUSION EQUATION,
utt_0053 utt 341.85 351.23 -X THAT MODELS THE TRANSPORT OF A PASSIVE QUANTITY IN A VELOCITY FIELD. THEN WE HAVE THE BURGER'S EQUATION, WHICH ALSO ADDS A VISCOSITY TERM TO THAT. AND THEN FINALLY,
utt_0055 utt 353.50 358.82 -X TWO INSTANCES OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS WITH A LIQUID SIMULATION OR A SMOKE SIMULATION.
utt_0056 utt 359.55 371.73 -X THEN ON THE RIGHT, YOU CAN SEE OUR TEST SETS. IN THE MIDDLE IS THE JOHNS HOPKINS TURBULENCE DATABASE, WHICH WE MADE USE OF AS A DATA RESPOSITORY. FOR THE VARIOUS SUBSETS
utt_0058 utt 371.77 378.18 -X OF THIS TURBULENCE DATABASE, WE CREATED SOME DATA SETS WITH DIFFERENT FLOW BEHAVIOUR.
utt_0059 utt 379.42 384.00 -X SIMILARLY, WE UTILIZED THE SCALARFLOW DATA SET ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT AS A
utt_0060 utt 384.96 399.81 -X SOURCE FOR ANOTHER TEST SET BASED ON A DATA REPOSITORY. ON THE TOP RIGHT, TWO SIMULATIONS ARE SIMILAR TO OUR ORIGINAL TRAINING DATA, HOWEVER WE ADDED NOISE TO THE SIMULATIONS,
utt_0062 utt 399.81 413.43 -X SO THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR TRAINING DATA. FINALLY, WE HAVE A SYNTHETIC MOVING SHAPES AND A MOVING DAMPED WAVES DATA SET, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY JUST RANDOM SHAPES MOVING IN A
utt_0064 utt 413.98 421.89 -X STRAIGHT LINE. THIS TENDS TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT FOR ELEMENT-WISE METRICS TO CLEARLY DISTINGUISH.
utt_0065 utt 422.24 435.27 -X NEXT, ONCE WE HAVE A SEQUENCE WE CAN THEN DETERMINE A BASIC GROUND DISTANCE, SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN A PREVIOUS APPRAOCH. IF WE ARE GIVEN A PAIR OF VOLUMES FROM A SEQUENCE WITH INDEX
utt_0067 utt 435.27 447.14 -X I AND J - AND THIS SEQUENCE ACTUALLY HAS LENGTH N - THEN W_S IS OUR DEFINITION OF THE GROUND TRUTH DISTANCE FOR THIS PAIR, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY JUST A LINEARLY INCREASING CHANGE OVER THE SEQUENCE.
utt_0069 utt 448.03 453.83 -X HOWEVER, THIS DOES ALSO RELY ON A HIGHLY ACCURATELY CALIBRATED SEQUENCE,
utt_0070 utt 453.83 461.09 -X BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISTANCES FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ARE NOT NECESSARLY NICELY COMPARABLE.
utt_0071 utt 461.09 463.91 -X AS A RESULT, WE CAME UP WITH AN ENTROPY-BASED SIMILARITY MODEL,
utt_0072 utt 465.12 470.12 -X THAT COMPENSATES FOR THE DECORRELATION SPEEDS OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. SO IT ESSENTIALLY MAKES
utt_0073 utt 470.18 475.16 -X SURE THAT THE SEQUENCES FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS ARE COMPARABLE. BUT IT ALSO
utt_0074 utt 475.62 481.27 -X TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THAT SYSTEMS CAN INITIALLY DECORRELATE A LOT FASTER, AND THEN
utt_0075 utt 482.47 488.07 -X DECORRELATE A LOT SLOWER. AND WE THEORIZED, THAT THE SIMILARITY SHOULD ALSO BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY.
utt_0076 utt 489.47 501.48 -X WE CAME UP WITH A LOGARITHMIC TRANSFORMATION OF OUR LINEAR GROUND TRUTH. WE DERIVED THIS FROM THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION I'M GOING TO SKIP THE DETAILS HERE, BUT YOU CAN LOOK THAT UP IN THE PAPER.
utt_0078 utt 501.48 514.06 -X ESSENTIALLY, WE ARE TAKING OUR LINEAR GROUND TRUTH, AND PUTTING THIS NON-LINEAR TRANSFORMATION ON TOP OF IT, THEN GETTING OUT MORE SUITABLE GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES G.
utt_0080 utt 515.59 529.54 -X THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT IS THE VALUE OF C. THIS IS ALSO VISUALIZED IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT. ESSENTIALLY, THE VALUE OF C CORRESPONDS TO THE DECORRELATION SPEED: IF C IS VERY HIGH,
utt_0082 utt 529.83 542.22 -X YOU TEND TO GET A CURVE LIKE THE RED CURVE, MEANING THAT THE SYSTEM DECORRELATES VERY, VERY QUICKLY. WHILE IF THE VALUE OF C IS VERY SMALL, YOU GET A RELATIVELY LINEAR BEHAVIOUR AS BEFORE.
utt_0084 utt 545.06 552.23 -X TO COMPUTE THIS VALUE OF C FOR EACH OF OUR SEQUENCES, WE ARE TAKING OUR EQUATION THAT WE
utt_0085 utt 552.84 565.93 -X CAME UP WITH, AND THEN PERFORM A LEAST-SQUARES OPTIMIZATION TO FIND C. WE ARE PUTTING IN A PLACEHOLDER PROXY DISTANCE - SO THE PCC IS THE PROXY DISTANCE IN THIS CASE - THAT ALLOWS US
utt_0087 utt 565.93 571.93 -X TO DETERMINE C FOR THE SYSTEM. AFTERWARDS, WE CAN BASICALLY APPLY THIS TRANSFORMATION TO OUR
utt_0088 utt 572.04 579.34 -X GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES TO COME UP WITH THE FINAL GROUND TRUTH, THAT WE CAN THEN USE FOR TRAINING.
utt_0089 utt 579.34 592.81 -X ONCE WE HAVE THE DISTANCES AND THE SEQUENCE, WE CAN THEN MAKE USE OF A FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL SIAMESE FEATURE EXTRACTOR NETWORK. YOU CAN SEE THE OUTLINE OF THIS APPRAOCH AT
utt_0091 utt 593.00 601.96 -X THE BOTTOM. ESSENTIALLY, WE HAVE A STANDARD CONVOLUTION + RELU BLOCK, BUT WE ALSO ADDED
utt_0092 utt 602.25 607.40 -X A PROCESSING OF THE INPUT ON VARIOUS DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS, WHICH WE FOUND TO BE QUITE CRITICAL,
utt_0093 utt 608.49 613.10 -X INSTEAD OF JUST PROCESSING IT IN A STRAIGHT LINE, AS IT IS NORMALLY DONE IN A CNN.
utt_0094 utt 614.54 620.20 -X ONCE WE HAVE ALL OF THE INTERMEDIATE FEATURE MAPS FROM THIS MULTISCALE NETWORK, WE NORMALIZE THEM,
utt_0095 utt 623.05 635.89 -X THEN COMPARE THEM, AND THEN AGGREGATE THEM TO A SINGLE, SCALAR DISTANCE. IN PREVIOUS WORK, WE ALSO SHOWED THAT THIS APPROACH ENSURES THE MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES OF A PSEUDO-METRIC. AT THAT POINT,
utt_0097 utt 635.89 643.44 -X IT IS JUST A SUPERVISED LEARNING PROBLEM OF OUR GROUND TRUTH DISTANCES WITH THIS MULTISCALE MODEL.
utt_0098 utt 643.44 647.85 -X THE LOSS WE ARE USING IN THIS CASE, GIVEN THE GROUND TRUTH G AND THE PREDICTION D,
utt_0099 utt 648.33 661.68 -X YOU CAN SEE HERE. IT CONSISTS OF A MEAN-SQUARED ERROR TERM ON THE LEFT, THAT DIRECTLY MINIMIZES THE DISTANCE DEVIATION. BUT WHAT WE ALSO FOUND TO BE QUITE IMPORTANT IS THE CORRELATION TERM ON THE RIGHT
utt_0101 utt 662.12 665.65 -X - THIS IS THE PEARSON CORRELATION - IN AN INVERTED CORRELATION TERM,
utt_0102 utt 667.08 674.11 -X THAT ESSENTIALLY TAKES CARE OF THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE DISTANCES TO EACH OTHER. YOU CAN
utt_0103 utt 674.57 684.34 -X IMAGING THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY INTERESTED IN THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THESE DISTANCES, BUT ALSO HOW THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER. AND THE TWO LAMBDA VALUES ARE ESSENTIALLY JUST WEIGHTING FACTORS.
utt_0105 utt 686.25 691.17 -X TO COME TO THE RESULTS, WE ANALYZED THE GENERALIZATION OF OUR METRIC TRAINED ON THE
utt_0106 utt 691.28 698.10 -X DATA AS MENTIONED BEFORE. WE CAN EVALUATE HOW WELL OUR PREDICTED DISTANCES MATCH TO THE GROUND TRUTH
utt_0107 utt 698.16 704.46 -X VIA SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION, WHERE A VALUE CLOSER TO one INDICATES A BETTER RECONSTRUCTION.
utt_0108 utt 704.46 717.07 -X AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR VOLSIM METRIC AT THE BOTTOM, QUITE CLEARLY OUTPERFORMS THE ELEMENT-WISE METRICS OF MSE OR THE STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY. AND EVEN LEARNED METRICS LIKE THE IMAGE-BASED LPIPS
utt_0110 utt 717.07 723.83 -X METHOD OR OUR PREVIOUS APPROACH FOR twoD DATA, IS OUTPERFORMED BY QUITE A BIT. THE ONLY CASES WHERE
utt_0111 utt 724.49 729.28 -X IT TENDS TO BE CLOSE IS WHERE THE CORRELATION IS ALREADY VERY HIGH AND ALL OF THE METRICS TEND TO
utt_0112 utt 730.06 741.65 -X BE QUITE ACCURATE. NEXT, WE ALSO LOOKED AT TRANSFORMATION INVARIANCE, AS ESSENTIALLY OUR METRIC SHOULD BE INVARIANT IF BOTH OF THE INPUTS ARE SCALED, OR ROTATED, OR TRANSLATED.
utt_0114 utt 742.35 753.39 -X SINCE CNN FEATURES ARE - APART FROM BOUNDARY EFFECTS OR POOLING - ALREADY INVARIANT TO TRANSLATION, WE MAINLY ANALYZE THE ROTATION AND THE SCALE INVARIANCE,
utt_0116 utt 755.18 765.52 -X BY TAKING eight RANDOM PAIRS FROM EACH OF OUR DATA SETS, ROTATING THEM IN SOME INCREMENTS OR SCALING THEM, AND THEN CHECKING HOW THE DISTANCES DEVIATE FROM THE MEAN. THIS IS
utt_0118 utt 765.52 770.93 -X PLOTTED IN THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT, AND IDEALLY A METRIC THAT IS PERFECTLY INVARIANT WOULD GIVE
utt_0119 utt 771.98 777.20 -X DISTANCE DEVIATION OF ZERO ACROSS ALL CASES, SO ESSENTIALLY A FLAT LINE. AS YOU CAN SEE,
utt_0120 utt 777.20 788.77 -X OUR PROPOSED METRIC AT THE BOTTOM TENDS TO BE QUITE A BIT MORE STABLE TO ROTATIONS AS WELL AS SCALE, COMPARED TO A NON-MULTISCALE APPROACH, WHICH IS A STANDARD CNN. SO WE
utt_0122 utt 790.35 797.24 -X FIND THAT THE FEATURE REPRESENTATION OF OUR NETWORK TENDS TO BE QUITE A BIT MORE STABLE.
utt_0123 utt 797.24 808.09 -X FINALLY, WE CONDUCTED A TURBULENCE CASE STUDY, WHICH IS AN ANALYSIS OF A LONGER SEQUENCE OF FORCED ISOTROPIC TURBULENCE. AND AGAIN EVALUATING THE DISTANCES FROM
utt_0125 utt 808.09 814.01 -X EACH OF OUR TIMESTEPS ALONG DIFFERENT TIME SPANS TO THE FIRST REFERENCE FRAME.
utt_0126 utt 815.89 824.17 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, OUR VOLSIM METRIC TENDS TO MATCH QUITE WELL WITH AN ESTABLISHED CORRELATION
utt_0127 utt 824.18 834.81 -X DISTANCE THAT IS TYPICALLY USED IN TURBULENCE RESEARCH, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NEVER TRAINED ON ANY TURBULENCE DATA, AND IT ALSO HAS TO GENERALIZE TO A LARGER DATA SIZE OF one hundred and twenty-eight^three INSTEAD OF sixty-four^three.
utt_0129 utt 840.27 848.66 -X TO SUMMARIZE, WE CAN LEARN A ROBUST SIMILARITY ASSESSMENT WITH OUR MULTISCALE METRIC. THE
utt_0130 utt 849.56 860.70 -X MAIN USE CASES FOR THE METRIC ARE THE ACCUARCY ASSESSMENT OF NEW SIMULATION METHODS, AND ALSO GUIDING GENERATIVE MODELS, FOR EXAMPLE GANS, THAT CAN BE UTILIZED TO SYNTHESIZE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS.
utt_0132 utt 861.40 866.33 -X SOME FUTURE WORK IS A SIMILARITY METRIC THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS TURBULENCE,
utt_0133 utt 866.93 871.32 -X AND ALSO A METRIC THAT IS SCALE OR ROTATION INVARIANT BY CONSTRUCTION,
utt_0134 utt 871.32 882.94 -X AS OUR APPRAOCH ONLY LEARNS THIS FROM THE DATA. WITH THIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS, YOU CAN HAVE A LOOK OUR PAPER OR OUR SOURCE
