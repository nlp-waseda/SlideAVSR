utt_0000 utt 1.52 6.08 -X HI MY NAME IS SVEN MAYER I'M FROM THE FUTURE INTERFACES GROUP AT THE CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY
utt_0001 utt 6.73 10.70 -X AND TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE PAPER WHICH WAS ACCEPTED TO CHI two thousand and twenty
utt_0002 utt 10.99 15.60 -X WITH THE PAPER TITLE: ENHANCING MOBILE VOICE ASSISTANCE WITH WORLDGAZE.
utt_0003 utt 15.95 22.23 -X THE RESEARCH I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH MY COLLABORATORS GIERAD LAPUT AND CHRIS HARRISON.
utt_0005 utt 24.40 27.60 -X AND WITH THAT LET'S DIVE INTO THE TOPIC OF MOBILE VOICE ASSISTANCE.
utt_0006 utt 28.08 33.30 -X TODAY EACH MAJOR SMARTPHONE MANUFACTURER DEVELOPS THEIR OWN VERSION OF A VOICE ASSISTANCE
utt_0007 utt 33.68 38.64 -X THUS, WE HAVE VOICE ASSISTANCE TO OUR DISPOSAL AT ALL TIME RIGHT IN OUR POCKET.
utt_0008 utt 39.15 46.32 -X TODAY, WE SEE THREE BIG COMPETITORS APPEL'S SIRI, SAMSUNG'S BIXBI, AND GOOGLE'S VOICE ASSISTANT.
utt_0009 utt 46.57 51.83 -X THEY CAN HELP US WITH OUR DAILY TASKS SUCH AS ADDING AND SUBTRACTING NUMBERS,
utt_0010 utt 51.83 59.44 -X SETTING AN ALARM, GIVEN US WEATHER INFORMATION, OR EVEN OR EVEN GIVEN AS OPENING HOURS FOR A SPECIFIC RESTAURANT.
utt_0012 utt 65.84 72.44 -X HOWEVER, WHEN LOOKING CLOSELY THEY ALL LACK IN FINE-GRAINED CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SURROUNDINGS.
utt_0013 utt 73.23 78.13 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE WHEN SIRI GETS ASKED ABOUT OPENING HOURS FOR STARBUCKS
utt_0014 utt 78.38 80.82 -X WHEN STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STARBUCKS
utt_0015 utt 81.26 86.28 -X SIRI SHOWS A LIST OF POSSIBLE OPTION FOR STARBUCKS SURROUNDING THE USER
utt_0016 utt 87.66 98.87 -X HOWEVER, WHEN THE USER IS LOOKING AT THE STARBUCKS IS THIS CLEAR FROM AN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE THAT A USER WANTS TO KNOW THE INFORMATION FOR THIS VERY SPECIFIC STARBUCKS.
utt_0018 utt 100.11 103.83 -X THUS, THIS EXAMPLE MAKES CLEAR THERE'S MORE CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
utt_0020 utt 110.97 115.77 -X WHICH WOULD MAKE ASSISTANT A WAY STRONGER COMPANION IN OUR DAILY LIVES
utt_0024 utt 136.15 141.21 -X LOOKING AT THE DEVICE USERS ARE USING TO MAKE INQUIRIES TO THE VOICE ASSISTANTS
utt_0025 utt 141.62 156.07 -X IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE BACK CAMERA OFFERS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO RETRIEVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE USER SURROUNDING WHILE THE BACK CAMERA OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE SURROUNDINGS AROUND THE USER BETTER
utt_0027 utt 156.07 162.68 -X IT IS NOT CLEAR YET IF THE USERS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S DISPLAYED WITHIN THE VIEWPORT OF THE CAMERA
utt_0028 utt 164.47 171.47 -X THUS, IN A SECOND STEP BY LOOKING AT THE FRONT CAMERA WE CAN ALSO RETRIEVE THE USERS GAZE VECTOR
utt_0029 utt 172.85 179.59 -X WITH WORLDGAZE, WE COMBINE THOSE TWO FEATURES THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE WORLD AND THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE USERS GAZE
utt_0031 utt 179.64 185.50 -X TO THEN EXTRACT WHERE THE USERS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT RETRIEVING THE PLACE OR OBJECT
utt_0033 utt 185.69 191.16 -X WHICH THEN CAN BE FED INTO A VOICE ASSISTANCE MAKING A CONTEXT-RICH INQUIRY
utt_0036 utt 200.89 205.92 -X BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PLACE WE GO TO HAS A GOOD RATING.
utt_0037 utt 205.92 210.11 -X IN THIS CASE, THAT'S DISCUSSED WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE MOBILE VOICE INTERACTION
utt_0038 utt 210.52 213.29 -X MAKING IT A CONTEXT OF WHERE INQUIRY
utt_0039 utt 213.53 221.50 -X FOR THIS, WE USE THE BACK CAMERA TO EXTRACT INFORMATION BOUT THE WORLD AND THE FRONT CAMERA TO EXTRACT THE GAZE DIRECTION
utt_0040 utt 223.10 228.88 -X THEN, BY KNOWING THE INTRINSICS FOR BOTH CAMERAS WE CAN RAY CAST THE USERS HEAD GAZE
utt_0041 utt 228.98 233.02 -X FROM THE FRONTCAMERA INTO THE SPACE OF THE BACK CAMERA
utt_0042 utt 233.46 237.37 -X IDENTIFYING THE OBJECT OR PLACED THE USERS LOOKING AT
utt_0044 utt 244.31 246.89 -X EITHER BY GIVING IT MORE VERBAL CUES
utt_0046 utt 256.19 264.64 -X WITH THE WORLDGAZE, WE IMPLEMENT A SYSTEM WHERE THIS EXTRA CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION IS ADDED TO THE INQUIRY AUTOMATICALLY
utt_0048 utt 264.92 269.01 -X MAKING THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE MORE NATURAL FEELING TO THE USER
utt_0049 utt 269.34 281.66 -X BUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT AT WORLGAZE WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD FEEL TO A USER HOW THE USER WOULD REACT TO SUCH A SYSTEM AND WHAT WE NEEDED TO CONSIDER WHEN IMPLEMENTING WORLDGAZE.
utt_0052 utt 282.56 291.81 -X THEREFORE, WE WERE IN AN EXPLORATION STUDY IN WHICH WE WIZARD-OF-OZED WORLDGAZE ALLOWING US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE USER WOULD REACT TO THE SYSTEM
utt_0054 utt 292.96 303.90 -X IN DETAIL, WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW VOICE ASSISTANCE ENHANCED WAS WORLDGAZE WOULD PERFORM TO ALTERNATIVES TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION.
utt_0056 utt 303.90 306.96 -X WE COMPARED WORLDGAZE HERE TO TWO ALTERNATIVES OF APPROACHES
utt_0057 utt 306.97 313.57 -X ONE WAS THE TRADITIONAL TOUCH APPROACH AND THE SECOND ONE WAS SIRI AS ONE OF TODAY'S MAJOR VOICE ASSISTANTS.
utt_0058 utt 315.10 320.23 -X IN THE TOUCH APPROACH, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO USE GOOGLE MAPS TO RETRIEVE INFORMATION.
utt_0059 utt 322.05 330.11 -X FOR FAIR COMPARISON, WE USED A BOOSTED VERSION OF SIRI WHICH ACTUALLY KNOWS WHICH RESTAURANT THE USERS TALKING ABOUT
utt_0060 utt 330.27 335.43 -X WITHOUT ASKING THE SECOND QUESTION OF WHICH RESTAURANT THE USER ACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT.
utt_0061 utt 337.89 346.39 -X DURING THE STUDY, WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO RETRIEVE DIFFERENT INFORMATIONS FROM THE SURROUNDING RESTAURANTS SUCH AS OPENING HOURS RATING AND PHONE NUMBERS
utt_0063 utt 348.29 353.06 -X AFTER EACH OF THE THREE CONDITIONS TOUCH, GAZE, AND WORLDGAZE
utt_0064 utt 353.31 359.94 -X WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO RATE THE SYSTEM USABILITY THE TASK LOAD AND IF THEY WOULD USE THE SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0065 utt 361.31 365.44 -X AFTER COMPLETING ALL THREE CONDITIONS WE SAT DOWN WITH PARTICIPANTS
utt_0066 utt 366.02 372.93 -X INTERVIEWING THEM ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH USING THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES AND HOW THEY COMPARED TO EACH OTHER.
utt_0068 utt 374.34 381.16 -X THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH twelve PARTICIPANTS nine MALES AND three FEMALES AND THE AVERAGE AGE WAS twenty-five YEARS.
utt_0069 utt 382.53 386.18 -X FIRST, I'M GOING TO PRESENT THE RESULTS FOR THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES
utt_0070 utt 386.95 390.02 -X LOOKING AT THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEM USABILITY SCARE
utt_0071 utt 390.11 393.99 -X ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN EFFECT FOR THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES
utt_0072 utt 394.37 399.97 -X AND INDEED A FREQUENT HAS ACTUALLY REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT
utt_0073 utt 400.16 401.70 -X ON THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES
utt_0074 utt 402.53 406.12 -X HOWEVER, POST HOC TESTS COULD NOT CONFIRM THIS EFFECT.
utt_0075 utt 407.14 415.56 -X SIMILARLY, FOR THE RAW NASA TLX WE ALSO CONDUCTED A FRIEDMAN TEST WHICH REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR THE MAIN EFFECTS
utt_0077 utt 416.26 422.47 -X IN THIS CASE, POST HOC ANALYSIS REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VOICE AND TOUCH
utt_0078 utt 422.66 427.72 -X POSITIONING TOUCH WITH THE HIGHEST WORKLOAD.
utt_0079 utt 427.72 435.05 -X FINALLY, FOR THE QUESTION ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE USE OF THE SYSTEM THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR THE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES
utt_0080 utt 436.04 441.05 -X WHILE THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AT FIRST MIGHT PICTURE A BAD OUTCOME FOR WORLDGAZE
utt_0081 utt 441.22 445.22 -X OUR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS DEFINITELY REVEALS A DIFFERENT PICTURE
utt_0082 utt 446.15 448.68 -X HERE, I WANT TO QUOTE THREE DIFFERENT PARTICIPANTS
utt_0083 utt 449.00 456.14 -X PARTICIPANT TWO STATED WORLDGAZE IS FASTER OR IT FEELS FASTER ANYWAY LESS FRUSTRATING.
utt_0084 utt 456.45 460.55 -X ANOTHER PARTICIPANT STATED WORLDGAZE WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE
utt_0085 utt 461.83 468.91 -X AND ANOTHER ONE GOES FURTHER STATING IMPLICIT INPUT WITH WORLDGAZE WOULD BE STRIKING.
utt_0086 utt 469.54 478.17 -X THUS IN SUMMARY TO CONCLUDE OUR EXPLORATION STUDY WE ARGUED THAT WORLDGAZE OFFERS A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE INTERACTION PARADIGMS
utt_0088 utt 479.37 482.92 -X THUS, I WANT TO TAKE THE REMAINING TIME TO TALK ABOUT USE CASES
utt_0089 utt 482.95 487.43 -X WHERE WORLDGAZE CAN ENHANCE FUTURE INTERACTIONS WITH VOICE ASSISTANTS
utt_0090 utt 489.57 496.91 -X AS ALREADY DISCUSSED IN THE MOTIVATION OF THIS TALK WORLDGAZE CAN ENHANCE INTERACTIONS WITH WISE ASSISTANTS WHILE BEING ON THE STREET.
utt_0095 utt 518.38 524.56 -X FOR INSTANCE IN A SMART HOME ENVIRONMENT WHEN INTERACTING WITH LIGHTS, TVS, AND THERMOSTATS.
utt_0096 utt 524.56 531.69 -X THIS CAN BE REAL POWERFUL AS IT CAN REDUCE THE INTERACTION WITH THESE DEVICES DOWN TO A SINGLE KEYWORD.
utt_0097 utt 532.71 535.68 -X LET'S IMAGINE THE SCENARIO IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER
utt_0098 utt 535.91 548.51 -X LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS AND BRINGING UP THE KEYWORD ON ALREADY TELLS THE SYSTEM THE WHOLE INTERACTION YOU AS A USER WANT THE SYSTEM TO PERFORM TURNING THIS VERY SPECIFIC LIGHT ON
utt_0100 utt 549.51 553.20 -X TODAY, WE NEED TO GO THROUGH APPS ON OUR MOBILE PHONES
utt_0101 utt 553.55 556.37 -X OR THROUGH VERY COMPLICATED EXPLANATIONS
utt_0102 utt 556.55 561.13 -X TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN SUCH A SYSTEM WHICH LIGHTS WE WOULD LIKE TO TURN ON.
utt_0103 utt 561.13 568.02 -X IT DOES NOT EVEN GIVE CONTEXT TO THE SPECIFIC KEYBOARD BUT ALSO ALLOWS US TO OVERLOAD KEYWORDS
utt_0104 utt 568.65 572.98 -X AS THE TV AND THE LIGHTS CAN BE TURNED ON WITH THE SAME KEYWORD
utt_0105 utt 573.26 578.61 -X AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OTHER KEYWORDS SUCH AS DOWN WHICH CAN TURN DOWN THE VOLUME OF THE TV
utt_0106 utt 578.86 581.39 -X OR TURN DOWN THE THERMOSTATS TEMPERATURE
utt_0107 utt 583.21 586.86 -X FOR THIS WE BUILD A DEMO SET UP OF WHICH I WILL PLAY A CLIP NEXT
utt_0108 utt 587.98 591.28 -X WHAT'S THE TREASURE? IT'S twenty-three DEGREES
utt_0109 utt 591.56 593.97 -X DOWN SETTING IT TO twenty-one DEGREES
utt_0110 utt 594.70 596.82 -X DOWN SETTING VOLUME TO seventy%
utt_0111 utt 599.02 603.25 -X WORLGAZE CAN NOT ONLY MAKE SMART-HOME INTERACTIONS EASIER AND MORE NATURAL
utt_0112 utt 603.76 607.06 -X BUT ALSO ENHANCE SCENARIOS LIKE RETAIL SETTINGS
utt_0113 utt 607.79 613.30 -X HERE, THE INTERACTION CAN BE ENHANCED BY SIMPLY LOOKING AT AN OBJECT AND ADDING IT TO YOUR WISH LIST
utt_0114 utt 614.13 617.71 -X ASKING FOR A SPECIFIC COLOR OF A SOFA IN THIS INSTANCE
utt_0115 utt 618.32 625.84 -X OR EVEN FORM COMPLEX QUESTIONS IN WHICH THE USERS NOT ONLY REFERENCING ONE BUT TWO OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME
utt_0116 utt 627.05 630.32 -X HOW ABOUT THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND THIS
utt_0117 utt 630.83 632.83 -X THE LEFT ARMCHAIR IS $fifty LESS
utt_0118 utt 634.70 639.41 -X IN CONCLUSION, TODAY, I PRESENTED WORLDGAZE TO ENHANCE MOBILE VOICE ASSISTANCE
utt_0119 utt 639.95 644.72 -X FIRST I PRESENTED OUR EXPLORATION STUDY WHICH WE BUILD OUR IMPLEMENTATION ON.
utt_0120 utt 645.33 649.40 -X FOR THE FULL DETAILS OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION, I REFER YOU TO OUR PAPER
utt_0121 utt 649.78 654.26 -X AND LASTLY, I PRESENTED HOW WORLDGAZE CANNOT ONLY ENHANCE INTERACTIONS
utt_0122 utt 654.45 659.17 -2.0488 ON THE STREET BUT ALSO IN SMART HOME ENVIRONMENTS AND RETAIL SETTINGS
