utt_0000 utt 1.45 4.37 -X HI, I'M RUBEN KRUIPER AND I'LL BE PRESENTING SPAR.TXT,
utt_0001 utt 4.37 7.41 -X A CHEAP SHALLOW PARSING APPROACH FOR REGULATORY TEXTS.
utt_0002 utt 8.14 17.07 -X THE AIM OF OUR WORK IS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLY DISCONTIGUOUS SPANS OF TOKENS THAT FORM A SINGLE UNIT OF INFORMATION. SO, AN EXAMPLE IN THE SENTENCE ABOVE HERE
utt_0004 utt 17.68 22.00 -X IS SHOULD [...] BE ENTERED, WHERE IT'S NOT A CONTIGUOUS SPAN OF TOKENS.
utt_0005 utt 22.00 33.62 -X WE USE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE ANNOTATION SCHEME, IN COMPARISON FOR/TO EXAMPLE GIVEN DEPENDENCY PARSING. WE ONLY HAVE FOUR SPAN TYPES AND WE HAVE A BIO TAGGING - A
utt_0007 utt 33.62 38.26 -X MODIFIED BIO TAGGING SCHEME WHERE WE DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT (O) OUTSIDE TAGS.
utt_0008 utt 38.26 42.51 -X SO WE ACTUALLY TAG EVERY TOKEN, WITH THE AIM OF LEVERAGING INTERDEPENDENCIES.
utt_0009 utt 43.85 50.74 -X AND THE LEARNING TASK IS SET UP IN A WAY THAT IT SHOULD EASILY TRANSFER KNOWLEDGE AND PATTERNS FROM PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS.
utt_0011 utt 50.74 58.84 -X SO THE RESULT IS A CHEAP METHOD - IN TERMS OF ANNOTATION AND HOW MUCH TRAINING DATA IS NEEDED - THAT CAN SUPPORT THE COLLECTION OF A DOMAIN LEXICON.
utt_0013 utt 59.86 69.97 -X WE EVALUATE OUR SYSTEM ON HOW WELL IT PREDICTS OBJECT SPANS FOUND IN THE SCOTTISH BUILDING REGULATIONS AND WE IDENTIFY - WE FIND THAT THE SYSTEM
utt_0015 utt 69.97 75.38 -X IDENTIFIES - ninety PERCENT OF THE DEFINED TERMS FOUND IN THE SPECIFIC DEFINED TERMS SECTION.
utt_0016 utt 75.89 87.09 -X AND IN COMPARISON TO HUMAN JUDGMENT, ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PREDICTED OBJECTS IS AN EXACT MATCH WITH WHAT A HUMAN WOULD ANNOTATE. AND YOU CAN FIND THE CODE AND DATA FOR OUR SYSTEM ON GITHUB.
utt_0019 utt 91.99 105.85 -X CHECKING (ACC) IN THE CONSTRUCTION DOMAIN. SO THAT I CAN KIND OF LIKE DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THIS WORK MORE SPECIFICALLY, AND THEN I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROCESSING DISCONTIGUOUS MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS (MWES), ANNOTATION, MODEL TRAINING, AND EVALUATION.
utt_0022 utt 106.64 116.02 -X SO AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE CHECKING IS ABOUT AUTOMATICALLY CHECKING WHETHER A BUILDING INFORMATION MODEL COMPLIES WITH THE RELEVANT BUILDING REGULATIONS.
utt_0024 utt 116.02 120.15 -X AND SO THESE BUILDING INFORMATION MODELS CAPTURE ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT BUILDINGS,
utt_0025 utt 120.15 124.92 -X LIKE DISTANCES, FIRE SAFETY MEASURES... WHAT-EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF IN ORDER TO
utt_0026 utt 125.20 130.55 -X TO SHOW THAT THE BUILDING ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH THE REGULATIONS BEFORE IT'S ALLOWED TO BE BUILT.
utt_0027 utt 130.55 135.21 -X BUT IT ALSO SHOULD CONTAIN THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION DURING MAINTENANCE AND EVEN FOR
utt_0028 utt 135.51 144.73 -X DESTRUCTION OF A BUILDING. AND SO REGULATORY DOCUMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR ALL OF THIS CONSTRUCTION WORK.
utt_0030 utt 145.72 155.29 -X AND NON-COMPLIANCE WITH BUILDING REGULATIONS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN LINKED TO FATAL ACCIDENTS AS WELL. THINK OF THE TOWER IN MIAMI OR GRENFELL TOWER IN LONDON.
utt_0032 utt 155.67 167.82 -X COMPLIANCE CHECKING BY HAND IS ACTUALLY A QUITE COMPLICATED TASK AND VERY TIME CONSUMING, BECAUSE THE REGULATIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER HUNDREDS OF MANUALLY CURATED DOCUMENTS. AND ALSO THE CRITERIA
utt_0034 utt 167.82 174.75 -X CAN BE AMBIGUOUS AND SOMETIMES EVEN CONFLICTING. CRITERIA OFTEN ALSO REFER TO SPECIFIC CLAUSES,
utt_0035 utt 174.75 179.80 -X OR EVEN ENTIRE SECTIONS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS. AND THE REGULATIONS CHANGE ALL THE TIME. SO
utt_0036 utt 179.86 185.28 -X AUTOMATION CAN REALLY REDUCE THE DIFFICULTY, TIME, COSTS AND NUMBER OF HUMAN ERRORS ETC.
utt_0037 utt 186.01 192.41 -X HOWEVER, AUTOMATION IS NOT THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD. SO IF YOU LOOK AT -KIND OF - WHAT IS REQUIRED,
utt_0038 utt 192.41 196.64 -X THEN ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THE REGULATION TEXTS AND ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE THESE BIM MODELS.
utt_0039 utt 197.53 207.58 -X AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU WOULD EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM THE REGULATIONS AND CLASSIFY THEM INTO CERTAIN SYMBOLS THAT HAVE TO MATCH THE SYMBOLS IN THESE BIM MODELS.
utt_0041 utt 207.90 212.03 -X SO THAT YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF LIKE SHARED REPRESENTATION THAT CAPTURES THE RULES,
utt_0042 utt 212.03 217.02 -X AND A REPRESENTATION FOR THESE BIM MODELS THAT CAN BE VALIDATED USING THAT SHARED PRESENTATION.
utt_0043 utt 218.04 224.32 -X NOW - SO THE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD IS KIND OF SPLIT BETWEEN TWO TYPES OF WORK.
utt_0044 utt 224.32 234.59 -X ON THE ONE HAND YOU HAVE THIS REASONING OVER A HARD-CODED RULE-BASED SYSTEM, TO CHECK WHETHER SOME SMALL PART OF THE MODEL ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH THE RULES IN THE RULE-BASED SYSTEM.
utt_0046 utt 234.84 238.37 -X AND ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE SEMANTIC PARSING WHICH FOCUSES ON
utt_0047 utt 238.49 244.74 -X NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TO IDENTIFY THESE RULES IN THE REGULATION TEXTS.
utt_0048 utt 244.74 251.04 -X NOW, THE CONVERSION OF TEXT TO RULES IS USUALLY DONE IN A KIND OF LIKE RULE-BASED MANNER.
utt_0049 utt 251.71 255.39 -X AND THE MACHINE LEARNING BASED STUDIES FOCUS MORE ON SUBTASKS
utt_0051 utt 260.64 272.32 -X AND A LOT OF THIS WORK TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY OMITS WORKING WITH QUALITATIVE CRITERIA, TABLES AND DIAGRAMS, AND ALSO EXCEPTIONS CONJUNCTIONS, LISTS, REFERENCES TO OTHER CLAUSES, ETC
utt_0053 utt 275.04 285.41 -X AND SO REALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE THESE QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA ONLY THAT ARE BEING PROCESSED. AND THEN IF YOU HAVE A RULE-BASED SYSTEM THAT COULD SOMEHOW
utt_0055 utt 286.40 298.66 -X IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OF RULE - OR COULD CONVERT THE SENTENCE TO SOMEWHAT OF A RULE - THEN YOU STILL HAVE TO IDENTIFY THESE SYMBOLS IN THAT RULE, OR IN THE TEXT. SO [HERE] SPAN, FLOOR, ETC.
utt_0057 utt 299.07 304.90 -X AND SO THE NEED IS FOR A DOMAIN LEXICON TO ACTUALLY GROUND THESE SYMBOLS AND RELATIONS.
utt_0058 utt 306.46 310.69 -X IF YOU LOOK AT ORTHOGONAL RESEARCH THEN THERE IS SOME WORK ON
utt_0059 utt 310.94 316.87 -X SORT OF IDIOSYNCRATIC MARKUP SCHEMES, THAT HELP HUMAN ANNOTATORS IDENTIFY REGULATIONS THAT ARE
utt_0060 utt 317.92 330.85 -X RELEVANT TO... WHATEVER WORK THEY ARE CHECKING ON COMPLIANCE. AND THERE'S ALSO SYSTEMS THAT TRY TO BREAK UP MORE COMPLICATED SENTENCES INTO SIMPLER CLAUSES.
utt_0062 utt 331.23 336.66 -X AND THESE TYPES OF WORKS - OR THIS TYPE OF DIRECTION OF WORK - ALSO FINDS THAT
utt_0063 utt 337.06 344.87 -X THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS DECREASES WHEN THEY'RE HANDLING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS. SO THE NEED REALLY IS FOR A DOMAIN LEXICON
utt_0065 utt 345.54 350.53 -X THAT CAN ALSO HANDLE MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS FOR AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE CHECKING.
utt_0066 utt 351.33 357.41 -X NOW WORKING WITH MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS IS A KEY ISSUE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.
utt_0067 utt 357.76 370.28 -X AND SO WE FOLLOW A SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION - KIND OF SIMPLE DEFINITION - WHERE MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS ARE POSSIBLY DISCONTIGUOUS WORD COMBINATIONS WHERE WORDS ARE SEPARATED BY WHITE SPACES OR PUNCTUATION IN TEXT.
utt_0070 utt 371.72 383.82 -X MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS ARE OFTEN ANNOTATED AS PART OF A TREE BANK, BUT HERE WE ARE NOT WORKING WITH TREES. AND SO WE RELY ON THIS ALTERNATIVE / KIND OF LIKE MODIFIED BIO TAGGING SCHEME.
utt_0072 utt 385.28 389.08 -X SPECIFICALLY WE ALSO OMIT THE (O) OUTSIDE TAG. SO WE END UP WITH
utt_0073 utt 389.12 394.79 -X FOUR TAG TYPES - UH - FOUR TAGS AND FOUR TYPES. AND FOR 'FUNCTIONAL' AND 'DISCOURSE'
utt_0074 utt 394.79 400.14 -X SPANS ,WE DON'T REALLY FIND ANY DISCONTIGUOUS SPANS. SO ACTUALLY WE END UP WITH twelve CLASSES.
utt_0075 utt 404.77 408.65 -X AS OUR DATA WE SCRAPE THE SCOTTISH BUILDING STANDARDS,
utt_0076 utt 408.65 411.91 -X BECAUSE A LOT OF THE BUILDING STANDARDS ARE ACTUALLY
utt_0077 utt 412.10 423.31 -X NOT IN A MACHINE PROCESSABLE FORMAT -- OR BEHIND A PAYWALL. AND SPECIFICALLY THE SCOTTISH BUILDING STANDARDS ARE MACHINE PROCESSABLE AND PUBLISHED UNDER THE CROWN COPYRIGHT.
utt_0079 utt 424.58 436.17 -X AND SO OUR ASSUMPTIONS DURING ANNOTATION - OR BEFORE ANNOTATION - ARE THAT THESE BUILDING REGULATIONS CONTAIN FEW TO NO IDIOMATIC EXPRESSIONS. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT WITH WORKING WITH MULTI-WORD EXPRESSIONS.
utt_0082 utt 437.03 450.03 -X AND WE ALSO EXPECT LITTLE VARIATION IN SURFACE FORMS. SO ACTUALLY, THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN A RELATIVELY SMALL VOCABULARY. (SO THERE'S LITTLE USE OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF EXPRESSING A CONCEPT,
utt_0084 utt 450.03 453.90 -X BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE LESS CLEAR -- THAT'S THE KIND OF INTUITION BEHIND THIS ASSUMPTION).
utt_0085 utt 453.90 465.36 -X AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THEN: IN COMPARISON TO THE BROWN CORPUS - A MUCH MORE HETEROGENEOUS CORPUS - THEN INDEED, THE SCOTTISH STANDARDS HAVE A LOT SMALLER VOCABULARY.
utt_0087 utt 470.44 476.05 -X WE ANNOTATED two hundred RANDOMLY SELECTED SENTENCES AND A SECOND DOMAIN EXPERT ANNOTATED one hundred and forty OF
utt_0088 utt 476.17 481.13 -X THESE. AND THE ENTER INTERANNOTATOR AGREEMENT WAS FOUND TO BE zero point seven nine, WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD.
utt_0089 utt 482.99 488.01 -X FOR THE SPECIFIC ANNOTATION GUIDELINES I WILL REFER TO THE PAPER, BECAUSE THERE'S
utt_0090 utt 488.17 494.42 -X NOT THAT MUCH TIME DURING THIS PRESENTATION. AND FOR THE MODEL WE USE A
utt_0091 utt 495.37 510.35 -X STRAIGHTFORWARD BILSTM WITH A CONDITIONAL RANDOM FIELD (CRF) ON TOP. THE THING WE DO ADD IS THIS RELATIVE POSITIONAL SELF ATTENTION WHICH PROVIDES SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PRECEDING AND ...
utt_0093 utt 510.86 516.21 -X TAGS THAT FOLLOW BASICALLY. AND THAT DOES IMPROVE PERFORMANCE A BIT.
utt_0094 utt 517.29 522.99 -X WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT SPANBERT EMBEDDINGS WOULD PROVIDE THE BEST PERFORMANCE FOR US, BUT ACTUALLY
utt_0095 utt 523.09 530.26 -X REGULAR BERT EMBEDDINGS PERFORM BETTER. SO THAT WAS A BIT COUNTER-INTUITIVE.
utt_0096 utt 530.26 536.15 -X BUT THAT'S POSSIBLY BECAUSE SPANBERT ONLY MASKS CONTIGUOUS SPANS, AND ALSO A FIXED SIZE OF SPANS.
utt_0097 utt 536.15 548.82 -X WHEREAS WE ARE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT SIZES AND DISCONTIGUOUS SPANS AS WELL. MORE GENERALLY THERE'S AN ISSUE OF COURSE WITH THE WITH HOW SMALL THE DATA SET IS AND THE IMBALANCE OF TAG TYPES.
utt_0099 utt 550.32 564.08 -X WE EVALUATE OUR SYSTEM EXTRINSICALLY ON IDENTIFYING OBJECT SPANS. SO THE FIRST THING WE DO IS WE COMPARE HOW MANY OF THE DEFINED TERMS - FROM THE DEFINED TERMS SECTION - WE ACTUALLY
utt_0101 utt 564.08 575.51 -X FIND IN THE TEXT. AND THAT'S ABOUT ninety PERCENT. SOME OF THE TERMS THAT WE MISS INCLUDE COMMON MODIFYING WORDS. FOR EXAMPLE, 'AVERAGE' IN 'AVERAGE FLUSH'. SO THAT WILL BE BROKEN UP BY THE
utt_0103 utt 575.51 582.39 -X SYSTEM INTO.. WELL 'AVERAGE' BEING A FUNCTIONAL SPAN AND 'FLUSH' BEING AN OBJECT SPAN BY ITSELF.
utt_0104 utt 583.44 587.03 -X AND ALSO THERE ARE SEVERAL UNSEEN SYNTACTIC PATTERNS,
utt_0105 utt 587.03 593.46 -X SUCH AS 'FACTORY' WITH '(CLASS one)' IN PARENTHESES, THAT THE SYSTEM HASN'T SEEN DURING TRAINING.
utt_0106 utt 594.83 606.97 -X WE ALSO PERFORM POST-HOC HUMAN JUDGMENT. WHERE WE INITIALLY PREDICT TAGS FOR ALL THE SENTENCES IN THE SCOTTISH REGULATIONS CORPUS. SO WE FIND ABOUT sixteen zero UNIQUE POTENTIAL OBJECT SPANS,
utt_0108 utt 608.53 614.04 -X AND WE RANDOMLY SELECT one hundred and sixty-five OF THESE - EXCLUDING THE DEFINED TERMS.
utt_0109 utt 614.04 618.23 -X AND THEN FOR EACH OF THESE OBJECTS, WE SELECT A SENTENCE IN WHICH THE OBJECT OCCURS.
utt_0110 utt 618.55 621.98 -X EUHM, AND THEN WE HAVE A HUMAN ANNOTATE WHETHER
utt_0111 utt 622.77 628.50 -X THEY AGREE WITH WHETHER THIS OBJECT IS ACTUALLY EXACTLY HOW IT SHOULD BE ANNOTATED.
utt_0112 utt 628.95 633.82 -X SO IN THE BOTTOM HERE FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE 'MECHANICAL INPUT AIR VENTILATION SYSTEMS',
utt_0113 utt 633.82 639.32 -X WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE A SINGLE UNIT OF INFORMATION BY THE HUMAN JUDGE.
utt_0114 utt 640.18 649.82 -X SO FINAL THOUGHTS, THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY QUITE IMPRESSIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING DATA. WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE TASK INDEED TRANSFERS KNOWLEDGE AND PATTERNS FROM
utt_0116 utt 649.82 662.33 -X PRE-TRAINED EMBEDDINGS WELL. AND THE CURRENT MODEL ALREADY SUPPORTS OR ENABLES THE MANUAL ASSEMBLY OF A DOMAIN LEXICON, AND ALSO IT PROVIDES - YOU KNOW - A WAY TO DO SOME ITERATIVE TRAINING
utt_0118 utt 662.33 667.80 -X AND RE-ANNOTATION SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY SENTENCES WHERE PREDICTION ERRORS ARE MADE.
utt_0119 utt 668.92 672.38 -2.2385 THAT BRINGS US TO THE QUESTIONS, THANK YOU!
