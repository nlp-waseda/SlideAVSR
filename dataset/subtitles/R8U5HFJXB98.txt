utt_0000 utt 1.04 2.13 -X - HI, EVERYONE.
utt_0001 utt 2.13 5.94 -X MY NAME IS MARK MCGILL, AND I'M RECORDING THIS TALK BOTH FOR CHI ON THE DIGITAL LIBRARY,
utt_0003 utt 5.94 7.28 -X AND FOR THE SICSA CHI DAY.
utt_0004 utt 7.37 15.15 -X AND TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR PAPER ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY AND THE CHANGING SOUNDSCAPE OF AUDITORY MIXED REALITY.
utt_0007 utt 15.15 19.95 -X SO WE'RE ALL INCREDIBLY FAMILIAR WITH HEADPHONES AS THE PREDOMINANT MEANS OF PERSONAL AUDIO DELIVERY.
utt_0009 utt 20.49 22.61 -X HEADPHONES ARE OCCLUSIVE.
utt_0010 utt 22.61 25.17 -X THEY DIMINISH OUR AWARENESS OF OUR AURAL REALITY.
utt_0011 utt 25.17 28.56 -X THEY ARE IMMERSIVE, SO WE ARE ENSCONCED IN OUR VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE.
utt_0013 utt 28.56 32.47 -X THEY'RE ENTIRELY EGOCENTRIC, SO OUR AUDIO SPACE IS FIXED TO OUR HEAD.
utt_0015 utt 32.47 34.19 -X AND THEY ARE NEAR UBIQUITOUS.
utt_0016 utt 34.19 36.31 -X BEING A STATUS QUO FOR NIGH-ON sixty YEARS.
utt_0017 utt 36.31 39.28 -X HOWEVER, THE STATUS QUO IS BEING DISRUPTED.
utt_0018 utt 39.63 42.74 -X FIRSTLY, IN TERMS OF AUDITORY HEADSET HARDWARE,
utt_0019 utt 42.93 46.72 -X WE NOW HAVE HEARABLES, WHICH ARE EAR MOUNTED WEARABLE COMPUTER INTERFACES
utt_0021 utt 46.77 54.84 -X EARABLES, WHICH ARE AUGMENTED AIR BUDS AND INTELLIGENT HEADSETS, ALL NOW CAPABLE OF HEAD ORIENTATION TRACKING, PHYSIOLOGICAL SENSING,
utt_0024 utt 54.84 56.85 -X CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS, AND SO ON.
utt_0025 utt 57.33 61.78 -X AND THIS SENSING CAN BE PACKED INTO DISCRETE, WEARABLE FORM FACTORS.
utt_0027 utt 62.22 68.37 -X THESE WEARABLES ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SIGNIFICANT ADOPTION, ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY DOGS WEAR HEADPHONES CURRENTLY.
utt_0030 utt 68.37 71.89 -X BUT PERHAPS THAT'S A QUESTION FOR SHAUN LAWSON AND THE DOG INTERNET.
utt_0032 utt 73.49 81.52 -X THESE DEVICES ARE ALSO ADVANCING IN TERMS OF ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY, WHICH REFERS TO THEIR CAPABILITY TO INTERMIX REAL AND VIRTUAL SOUNDS.
utt_0035 utt 81.55 90.61 -X FOR HEADSETS AND NOISE CANCELING DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONE ARRAYS CAN BE USED TO ALSO CAPTURE AND SELECTIVELY INCORPORATE SURROUNDING AUDIO,
utt_0038 utt 90.71 93.94 -X AND WHAT IS TERMED ACTIVE ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY.
utt_0039 utt 94.03 108.12 -X HOWEVER, PASSIVE ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT AUDIO SOLUTIONS ARE NOW ON THE MARKET, CAPABLE OF FIDELITY THAT FAR EXCEEDS THAT OF THE BONE CONDUCTANCE OF A PREVIOUS ERA BY USING DIRECTIONAL SPEAKER RAYS AS YOU CAN SEE HERE AT THE BOTTOM,
utt_0044 utt 108.18 109.88 -X PLACED AROUND THE USER'S NECK,
utt_0045 utt 109.88 113.01 -X OR IN THE FRAMES OF A PAIR OF GLASSES.
utt_0046 utt 113.46 115.06 -X SO, WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
utt_0047 utt 115.06 118.42 -X WELL, PASSIVE ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY CAN BE WEARABLE,
utt_0048 utt 118.42 119.67 -X NAY FASHIONABLE.
utt_0049 utt 119.95 122.77 -X IT ALLOWS FOR PERSONAL, PRIVATE AUDIO SPACES.
utt_0050 utt 122.83 126.84 -X IT'S NOT OCCLUSIVE, SO YOU CAN STILL THEORETICALLY HEAR THE SOUNDS OF REALITY.
utt_0052 utt 127.19 136.31 -X AND THEY TYPICALLY INCORPORATE SOME ADDITIONAL SENSING SO INERTIAL MEASURING UNITS AND MICROPHONE ARRAYS CURRENTLY AND SO THEY'RE CAPABLE OF EXOCENTRIC AUDIO EXPERIENCES.
utt_0055 utt 136.31 141.75 -X SO THIS REPRESENTS QUITE AN ADVANCEMENT IN TERMS OF PERSONAL AUDIO.
utt_0057 utt 142.07 145.21 -X HOWEVER, IT'S NOT JUST THE HARDWARE THAT'S CHANGING,
utt_0058 utt 145.21 147.00 -X IT'S THE SOFTWARE TOO.
utt_0059 utt 147.00 150.36 -X AND SPECIFICALLY, REGARDING AUDIO SPATIALIZATION WHEN MOBILE.
utt_0061 utt 151.19 155.80 -X SO SPATIAL AUDIO LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY GOOGLE, OCULUS, AND FILE AMONGST OTHERS.
utt_0063 utt 155.80 159.67 -X HERE WE'RE SHOWING A CLIP FROM THE RESONANCE AUDIO LIBRARY AT GOOGLE [DIGITAL SOUNDS]
utt_0066 utt 159.67 162.34 -X AND THESE COME COMPLETE WITH SUPPORT WITH THINGS LIKE
utt_0067 utt 163.00 165.91 -X threeD SPATIALIZATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REVERBERATION,
utt_0068 utt 168.89 169.95 -X [MUSIC]
utt_0069 utt 169.95 171.87 -X AND EVEN OCCLUSION AND DIRECTIVITY.
utt_0070 utt 173.78 174.75 -X [DIGITAL SOUNDS]
utt_0071 utt 177.91 181.50 -X NOW THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE BOOM IN VR DEVELOPMENTS.
utt_0073 utt 181.50 186.07 -X SO TYPICALLY BETTER AUDIO LEADS TO BETTER PRESENCE IN VIRTUAL REALITY.
utt_0075 utt 186.07 191.71 -X AND WE KNOW THAT THESE FEATURES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT THE PERCEPTION IN TERMS OF PRESENCE AND EXTERNALIZATION IN VR,
utt_0078 utt 192.50 198.62 -X E.G. FOR EXTERNALIZATION THAT THE SOUNDS APPEAR TO EMANATE FROM THE WORLD.
utt_0080 utt 198.81 202.91 -X THEIR USE IS ALSO FAIRLY TRIVIAL FOR PRACTITIONERS AND DEVELOPERS.
utt_0082 utt 203.06 204.41 -X MOST IMPORTANTLY,
utt_0083 utt 204.41 207.32 -X MOST ARE SUPPORTED NATIVELY ON MOBILE PLATFORMS.
utt_0084 utt 207.32 212.06 -X SO RESONANCE IN PARTICULAR WORKS ACROSS WINDOWS, MAC, IOS, AND ANDROID.
utt_0086 utt 213.98 220.57 -X AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO RENDER VIRTUAL AUDIO WITH LIFELIKE QUALITIES HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.
utt_0088 utt 220.63 223.69 -X AND OUR ABILITY TO INTERMIX HIGH FIDELITY AUDIO
utt_0089 utt 224.28 228.32 -X WITH REAL WORLD AUDIO HAS ALSO INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.
utt_0090 utt 228.32 237.18 -X HOWEVER, THERE ARE LOTS OF UNKNOWNS HERE REGARDING THINGS LIKE THE IMPACT OF HEAD-TRACKED SPATIALIZATION, HOW AUDIO IS PERCEIVED GIVEN ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY,
utt_0094 utt 237.18 239.39 -X AND THE INTERMIXING OF SOUNDS OF REALITY,
utt_0095 utt 239.67 247.52 -X AND PARTICULARLY ACROSS DIFFERENT KINDS OF CONTENT AND EXPERIENCES THAT WE MIGHT IMAGINE ARE NOW FEASIBLE OR POSSIBLE FOR MOBILE AUDIO.
utt_0098 utt 249.56 262.59 -X SO THIS CONTEXT AND A CHANCE DEMO OF KEN PERLINS PAIR OF BOSE FRAMES AT CHI two thousand and nineteen, WAS WHAT LED US TO CONDUCT A STUDY LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY ON AUDIO EXPERIENCES.
utt_0102 utt 262.59 264.83 -X SO WE HAVE TWO RESEARCH QUESTIONS HERE.
utt_0103 utt 264.83 272.09 -X SO FIRSTLY, ARE AUDIO EXPERIENCES PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY WHEN RENDERED ON ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT VERSUS OCCLUSIVE HEADSETS?
utt_0106 utt 272.38 279.58 -X AND SECONDLY, TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE REAL WORLD BACKDROP INFLUENCE THE PERCEPTION OF VIRTUAL SOUNDS ACROSS THE HEADSETS?
utt_0109 utt 281.05 284.77 -X WE DETERMINED THREE FACTORS WE WANTED TO LOOK AT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.
utt_0111 utt 284.77 286.46 -X FIRSTLY, THE HEADSET TYPE.
utt_0112 utt 286.46 288.42 -X AND WE CHOSE TWO HEADSETS HERE,
utt_0113 utt 288.42 292.13 -X WITH AN INTEGRATED IMUS FOR HEADTRACK SPATIALIZATION.
utt_0114 utt 292.13 296.22 -X THEY WERE THE OCCLUSIVE BOSE NOISE CANCELING seven hundred HEADPHONES
utt_0115 utt 296.54 299.20 -X AND THE ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT BOSE FRAMES.
utt_0116 utt 301.66 304.38 -X SECONDLY, THE PERCEPTION AGAINST
utt_0117 utt 304.51 306.85 -X THE REAL WORLD BACKDROP WAS NOW A FACTOR.
utt_0118 utt 306.85 309.73 -X SO WE ARE LOOKING BOTH AT MOBILE OUTDOOR USAGE,
utt_0119 utt 309.73 312.32 -X WHERE BACKGROUND IS LOUD [BACKGROUND NOISE] OUTDOORS,
utt_0121 utt 312.32 315.87 -X AND USAGE IN A CONTROLLED LAB ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0122 utt 316.06 319.68 -X AND THIRDLY, WE EXPLORED USAGE ACROSS FOUR CONTENT TYPES,
utt_0123 utt 319.71 323.07 -X PODCAST CONTENT, AND I'LL PLAY A SNIPPET OF THAT NOW.
utt_0124 utt 323.07 328.83 -X - [PODCAST HOST] AS USUAL, SCIENCE COULDN'T LEAVE IT ALONE, COULD IT? NO.
utt_0126 utt 328.83 333.54 -X SO, GALILEO STUCK HIS TELESCOPE IN SPOTS OF MOON CIRCLING AROUND JUPITER,
utt_0128 utt 333.54 336.90 -X TYPICALLY THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW WE'RE STUCK IN THE BACK WALL OF THE GALAXY,
utt_0130 utt 336.90 338.63 -X THAT'S AMONG two TRILLION OTHER GALAXIES,
utt_0131 utt 338.63 340.58 -X WITH BILLIONS OF PLANET IN EACH OF THE UNIVERSE.
utt_0132 utt 340.58 342.05 -X - IMMERSIVE DRAMA CONTENT.
utt_0133 utt 343.45 346.34 -X - [NARRATOR] HALF A CENTURY LATER,
utt_0134 utt 346.40 353.73 -X RAF, NATO, SOVIET SPACE PROGRAM DOSSIERS HAVE BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND AUDIO RECORDINGS OF THE NIGHT IN QUESTION HAVE FINALLY BEEN RECOVERED.
utt_0138 utt 354.69 355.97 -X [WINDY NOISES]
utt_0139 utt 356.06 360.32 -X - [NARRATOR] BLUE BOTTLE FIVE, IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE WIND
utt_0140 utt 362.59 363.81 -X [MACHINE WHIRRING]
utt_0141 utt 363.81 367.20 -X - AMBIENT CONTENT, SUCH AS LOCATION BASED AUDIO.
utt_0142 utt 367.20 369.96 -X [BIRDS CHIRPING]
utt_0143 utt 369.96 372.68 -X [FOOTSTEPS]
utt_0144 utt 372.68 381.28 -X [WIND RUSTLING TREES]
utt_0145 utt 388.80 391.14 -X - AND AUDIO TOUR GUIDE CONTENT.
utt_0146 utt 391.14 393.29 -X SO THIS IS LOCATION BASED VOICE CLIPS.
utt_0148 utt 396.74 398.47 -X AND THE NOW INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED CHIP,
utt_0149 utt 398.47 399.56 -X REMAIN A DEFINING FEATURE.
utt_0150 utt 399.91 404.61 -X SOME, LIKE JINTY MCGUINTY'S IRISH BAR HAVE BEEN THERE A WHILE TOO, ALMOST twenty-five YEARS.
utt_0152 utt 404.61 409.16 -X - REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS, THERE WERE fifteen PARTICIPANTS:
utt_0153 utt 409.16 411.69 -X TEN FEMALE, FOUR MALE, ONE NON BINARY,
utt_0154 utt 412.03 415.40 -X AVERAGE AGE twenty-seven YEARS, EACH PAID twenty POUNDS TO TAKE PART.
utt_0155 utt 415.62 418.12 -X AND THIS WAS ACROSS TWO SESSIONS,
utt_0156 utt 418.12 424.39 -X SO WE DID INDOORS THEN OUTDOORS FOR PRACTICALITY WITH CONTENT ORDER COUNTER-BALANCED WITHIN EACH OF THESE SESSIONS.
utt_0159 utt 426.47 428.65 -X NOW, FOR OUR PODCAST CONTENT,
utt_0160 utt 428.65 432.90 -X WE FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY CAUSED GREATER CAPTIVATION.
utt_0162 utt 432.96 440.81 -X THE AUDIO FELT PART OF THE WORLD, BASED ON THE LOCATION I.E., BOTH HEADSETS EXHIBITED THIS AFFECT SO ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY DIDN'T MATTER HERE.
utt_0165 utt 441.28 443.59 -X AND FOR ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY SPECIFICALLY,
utt_0166 utt 443.97 447.69 -X IT IMPACTED THE EXTERNALIZATION AND AWARENESS OF REALITY.
utt_0167 utt 448.42 450.95 -X FOR DRAMA CONTENT, THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT
utt_0168 utt 451.24 454.79 -X ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY LED TO THE FEELING OF BEING IN AN ACTIVE ENVIRONMENT,
utt_0170 utt 454.88 457.45 -X AND IT MADE THE AUDIO FEEL MORE PART OF THE WORLD.
utt_0171 utt 459.46 467.18 -X FOR AMBIENT CONTENT, ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY IMPROVED EXTERNALIZATION, PRESENCE, AND AWARENESS OF AND ATTENTION TO REALITY.
utt_0174 utt 467.72 471.18 -X AND THE LOCATION IMPACTED THE EXTERNALIZATION,
utt_0175 utt 471.18 474.76 -X I.E. OUTDOORS AUDIO FELT MORE EXTERNALIZED IN THIS CASE.
utt_0176 utt 475.37 481.26 -X AND FOR TOUR CONTENT, THERE WAS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT AUDIO FELT MORE PART OF THE WORLD BASED ON LOCATION, WHEN OUTDOORS.
utt_0179 utt 483.59 485.67 -X NOW, OUR INTERPRETATION HERE
utt_0180 utt 486.25 489.93 -X WELL, THE RESULTS WEREN'T AS CLEAR CUT AS WE PERHAPS EXPECTED.
utt_0182 utt 489.93 494.38 -X AND THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T UNIFORM BY CONTENT, TYPE, OR LOCATION, NOR EVEN THE MODALITY.
utt_0184 utt 494.38 501.36 -X FOR EXAMPLE THERE WERE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SPEECH OF THE PODCAST CONTENT AND THE SPEECH OF THE AUDIO TOUR GUIDE CONTENT.
utt_0187 utt 501.48 503.69 -X SO, WHY WAS THIS THE CASE?
utt_0188 utt 503.78 512.01 -X SO DIFFERENT PEOPLE COULD HAVE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT WHEN VIRTUAL AUDIO FELT REAL, IF AT ALL.
utt_0191 utt 512.01 515.40 -X IN INTERVIEWS, WE ASKED PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR PERCEIVED REALISM
utt_0192 utt 515.66 521.29 -X AND ten PARTICIPANTS MADE COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE FRAMES MADE SOME CONTENT APPEAR MORE REAL.
utt_0194 utt 521.29 524.49 -X SO PARTICIPANT FOUR, REGARDING VOICE CONTENT,
utt_0195 utt 524.49 532.05 -X SAID THAT BUT WITH THE FRAMES IT DID SOUND MORE LIKE SOMEONE WAS STANDING BESIDE YOU TALKING RATHER THAN JUST ON HEADPHONE.
utt_0198 utt 532.05 542.16 -X PARTICIPANT ONE, WHEN THEY HEARD THUNDER IN THE DRAMA CONTENT WHEN OUTSIDE, SAID IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DISTURBING WHEN I THOUGHT I COULD HEAR THUNDER BECAUSE THE AUDIO WAS SO GOOD I DIDN'T KNOW THE THUNDER WASN'T REAL.
utt_0204 utt 542.16 544.94 -X SO IT CHANGED MY PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
utt_0205 utt 544.94 546.77 -X BUT OPINIONS WEREN'T CLEAR CUT HERE.
utt_0206 utt 546.77 551.76 -X SO SOME PARTICIPANTS FOUND THE AUDIO WAS EQUALLY PERCEIVED AS REAL ACROSS HEADSET TYPES.
utt_0209 utt 551.82 555.57 -X SO ONE PERSON NOTED THE BIRDSONG, FOR EXAMPLE,
utt_0210 utt 555.57 557.52 -X BEING PERCEIVED AS REAL BIRDS,
utt_0211 utt 557.52 559.98 -X WHEN HEARD ON NOISE CANCELING HEADPHONES,
utt_0212 utt 559.98 562.35 -X WITH THE NOISE CANCELLATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVE.
utt_0213 utt 563.98 565.84 -X REGARDING AWARENESS AND SAFETY,
utt_0214 utt 565.84 574.45 -X FIVE PARTICIPANTS NOTED AUDITORY ISOLATION REQUIRED MORE VISUAL ATTENTION TO THE REAL WORLD TO COMPENSATE, SO THIS IS WHEN WEARING THE OCCLUSIVE HEADPHONES.
utt_0218 utt 574.45 583.12 -X AND PERSONAL SAFETY WAS NOTED EITHER DIRECTLY OR IMPLICITLY BY SIX PARTICIPANTS AS A BENEFIT OF ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY VERSUS THE OCCLUSIVE HEADWEAR.
utt_0221 utt 583.12 586.48 -X SO FOR EXAMPLE, PARTICIPANT five SAID IF I DON'T HEAR SOMEONE'S BEHIND ME,
utt_0223 utt 586.48 588.18 -X THAT'S A BIT SCARY.
utt_0224 utt 589.29 591.79 -X AND THIS IS BACKED UP BY OUR QUESTIONNAIRE DATA.
utt_0225 utt 591.79 599.95 -X SO, BROADLY, PARTICIPANTS STRONGLY AGREED THAT THEY FELT SAFER AND MORE SECURE LISTENING TO AUDIO USING THE ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT HEADWEAR.
utt_0228 utt 601.33 603.67 -X FOR ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY, SPECIFICALLY,
utt_0229 utt 603.67 608.85 -X PARTICIPANTS WERE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE REGARDING CONCERNS ABOUT OTHERS OVERHEARING THEIR ACTIVITIES.
utt_0232 utt 608.85 614.48 -X AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE OF THE OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE MORE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO PRIVATELY HEAR NOTIFICATIONS,
utt_0235 utt 614.48 619.38 -X INSTEAD OF VIA THE SMART PHONE THAT ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY WOULD BE A KEY FEATURE
utt_0237 utt 619.60 621.68 -X IN FUTURE PURCHASE OF AN AUDIO HEADSET
utt_0238 utt 622.16 630.77 -X THAT THEY WOULD WEAR SUCH AN AUDIO DEVICE THROUGHOUT THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES AND THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO USE AUDIO BASED APPLICATIONS DAY TO DAY
utt_0242 utt 630.80 635.63 -X GIVEN ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY IN THEIR AUDITORY HEADSET.
utt_0243 utt 635.63 637.36 -X AND REGARDING LISTENING HABITS,
utt_0244 utt 637.36 645.30 -X OVER HALF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO AMBIENT AUDIO, MUSIC, AND PODCASTS WITH THE PRESENCE OF WEARABLE ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY,
utt_0248 utt 645.33 650.42 -X AND VOICE INTERACTIONS ALSO BENEFITED AS WELL, TO A LESSER DEGREE.
utt_0250 utt 650.99 653.08 -X SO THERE ARE SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS HERE.
utt_0251 utt 653.08 659.80 -X ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY CAN ALTER THE PERCEPTION FOR SPECIFIC CONTENT IN TERMS OF REALISM AND EXTERNALIZATION.
utt_0254 utt 659.80 663.00 -X BUT THAT ALTERATION IS NOT UNIFORM ACROSS CONTENT,
utt_0255 utt 663.00 665.20 -X SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF WHAT WE CLAIM THERE.
utt_0256 utt 665.39 671.48 -X IT CAN IMPROVE THE AWARENESS OF AND PRESENCE IN REALITY, SOMETIMES.
utt_0258 utt 671.48 678.52 -X SO FOR IMMERSIVE CONTENT, AWARENESS SEEMS TO BE MODERATED BY A COGNITIVE DEMAND AND ATTENTION REQUIRED FOR THAT CONTENT.
utt_0261 utt 678.52 681.94 -X ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY APPEARS SAFER THAN OPAQUE HEADSETS,
utt_0262 utt 681.94 684.82 -X SO PARTICULARLY FOR THE PEDESTRIAN SETTINGS WE WERE LOOKING AT HERE.
utt_0264 utt 685.84 691.06 -X IT COULD ENCOURAGE VOICE ASSISTANT UPTAKE AND IT COULD LEAD TO A RESURGENCE OF AUDITORY INTERACTIONS.
utt_0267 utt 691.06 695.09 -X PEOPLE BROADLY SEEMED FAVORABLE TO THE IDEA OF DOING MORE WITH THEIR AUDIO SPACE
utt_0269 utt 695.19 699.25 -X IF THEY HAD THIS ALWAYS AVAILABLE PERSONAL, WEARABLE AUDIO DEVICE.
utt_0271 utt 702.19 704.28 -X WHAT OUR WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED,
utt_0272 utt 704.28 708.81 -X IS THAT AUDITORY AUGMENTED REALITY IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT AS A CATCHALL
utt_0274 utt 708.91 711.29 -X TERM FOR THESE KINDS OF EXPERIENCES.
utt_0275 utt 711.35 715.00 -X SO OUR PAPER CONTAINS DEFINITIONS FOR AUDITORY HEADSETS,
utt_0276 utt 715.00 719.13 -X AUDITORY VIRTUAL REALITY, AUDITORY AUGMENTED REALITY,
utt_0277 utt 719.22 730.30 -X THAT BETTER TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT AND OPAQUE HEADSETS, AND THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF MIXED REALITY CONTENT.
utt_0281 utt 730.58 733.88 -X AND REGARDING THE TYPES OF AUDITORY AUGMENTATIONS NOW POSSIBLE,
utt_0283 utt 733.88 735.83 -X THE CAPABILITIES OF PERSONAL AUDIO,
utt_0284 utt 735.83 738.14 -X IN TERMS OF SENSING, CAPTURE, AND DELIVERY,
utt_0285 utt 738.23 744.34 -X ARE RAPIDLY ADVANCING AND ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO NEW AND MORE FEASIBLE AUDITORY AUGMENTATIONS.
utt_0288 utt 744.34 747.77 -X SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE CONSIDER AUDITORY EXTENDED PERCEPTION,
utt_0289 utt 747.77 750.43 -X SO THAT'S EXPERIENCES THAT ENHANCE REALITIES,
utt_0290 utt 750.43 753.82 -X IT'S BEEN TERMED SUPERHEARING OR AUDITORY CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT,
utt_0292 utt 754.01 755.83 -X WE COULD IMAGINE BEING IN A NOISY ROOM,
utt_0293 utt 755.83 758.27 -X AND BEING ABLE TO BLOCK OUT THE CONVERSATIONS OF OTHERS,
utt_0295 utt 758.27 760.92 -X AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH A FRIEND,
utt_0296 utt 760.92 763.26 -X CAPTURED AND RELAYED A LATENCY.
utt_0297 utt 763.45 768.35 -X FOR AUDITORY ALTERED REALITY, EXPERIENCES THAT MODIFY OR OVERWRITE REALITY.
utt_0299 utt 768.35 774.75 -X THESE HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO IN THE PAST AS AUDITORY MEDIATED REALITY, OR WARPED REALITY,
utt_0301 utt 774.75 777.40 -X OR META COOKIE PLUS PLUS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS.
utt_0302 utt 777.40 785.40 -X WE COULD ENHANCE THE AUDITORY EXPERIENCE OF EATING FOOD MUCH MORE TRIVIALLY USING SUCH HEADSETS.
utt_0304 utt 785.40 788.70 -X FINALLY, WE CAN REFLECT THAT ACOUSTIC TRANSPARENCY
utt_0305 utt 788.86 791.93 -X LENDS USERS A PERSONAL, PRIVATE, AFFORDABLE,
utt_0306 utt 791.93 793.53 -X ALWAYS AVAILABLE SOUNDSPACE.
utt_0307 utt 793.53 798.27 -X SO THIS COMES IN FORM FACTORS THAT ARE WEARABLE AND NEAR FASHIONABLE.
utt_0309 utt 798.39 803.00 -X MARK WEISER DISCUSSED THE CONCEPTS OF INVISIBLE COMPUTING AND EMBODIED VIRTUALITY,
utt_0311 utt 803.00 807.00 -X WITH THE AIM OF HAVING TECHNOLOGY WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC OF EVERYDAY LIFE.
utt_0313 utt 807.64 813.79 -X AUDITORY MIXED REALITY HEADSETS HAVE PROPERTIES WHICH SUGGEST THEY COULD BECOME AN ENDPOINT FOR SUCH A VISION.
utt_0316 utt 813.79 817.98 -X SO FROM EMBEDDING A CONVERSATIONAL VIRTUAL AGENT IN YOUR EAR,
utt_0318 utt 817.98 820.09 -X SO CHANGING YOUR PERCEPTION OF AN ENVIRONMENT,
