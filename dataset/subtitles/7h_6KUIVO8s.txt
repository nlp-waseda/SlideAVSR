utt_0000 utt 4.75 10.91 -X HELLO EVERYONE! WELCOME TO EDUCATIONAL DATA MINING CONFERENCE. I'M SAHAN BULATHWELA
utt_0001 utt 11.08 24.43 -X CURRENTLY AFFILIATED WITH CENTER FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON. TODAY WE ARE PRESENTING OUR WORK PREDICTING ENGAGEMENT IN VIDEO LECTURES WHICH IS DONE AS PART OF THE XfiveGON PROJECT.
utt_0004 utt 26.03 39.82 -X DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES, OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND VIDEO PLATFORMS SUCH AS YOUTUBE, THE CREATION OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES IN THE
utt_0006 utt 39.82 52.24 -X RECENT YEARS HAS RAPIDLY INCREASED. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A GOOD LEARNER EXPERIENCE USING VIDEO LECTURES, ENGAGING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS HAVE TO BE
utt_0008 utt 52.24 63.03 -X IDENTIFIED AND PRESENTED TO THE LEARNERS WHILE PRESERVING THE OTHER ASPECTS OF A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IDENTIFYING THE
utt_0010 utt 63.03 75.67 -X ENGAGE-ABILITY OR THE ENGAGEMENT POTENTIAL OF VIDEO LECTURES ALSO ATTRIBUTES TO QUALITY ASSURANCE OF VIDEO LECTURES. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT AN
utt_0012 utt 75.67 88.16 -X ENGAGEMENT WE RECOGNIZE TWO TYPES OF ENGAGEMENT. THERE IS CONTEXTUAL ENGAGEMENT THAT ASSOCIATES TO THE CONTEXT OF THE LEARNER. WHAT THIS MEANS
utt_0014 utt 88.16 93.62 -X IS THAT THE ENGAGEMENT THAT ATTRIBUTES FROM THE INTERESTS OF THE LEARNER,
utt_0015 utt 93.62 106.39 -X THE LEARNING GOALS OF THE LEARNER AND ALSO IT COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE EMOTIONAL STATE OR THE AFFECTIVE STATE OF THE LEARNER. ALSO WE RECOGNIZE CONTEXT
utt_0017 utt 106.39 120.59 -X AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT WHICH REPRESENTS THE OVERALL ENGAGE-ABILITY OR THE ENGAGEMENT POTENTIAL OF A EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL. THIS DOES NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE CONTEXT OF
utt_0019 utt 120.59 130.51 -X THE LEARNER , RATHER IT ASSOCIATES TO THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE LECTURE OR THE EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL ITSELF. IT COULD BE LOOKED AS THE MARGINAL ENGAGEMENT OF A
utt_0021 utt 130.51 140.84 -X VIDEO LECTURE ACROSS A LEARNER POPULATION. IN THIS WORK WE FOCUS ON CONTEXT- AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT BECAUSE WE SEE THE
utt_0023 utt 140.84 150.16 -X VALUE OF CONTEXT AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT IN SEVERAL PROMISING USE CASES.
utt_0024 utt 150.16 164.15 -X IN ORDER TO BUILD A PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT PREDICTS CONTEXT-AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT IN VIDEO LECTURES WE FORMULATE SIX RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT WILL ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
utt_0026 utt 164.15 175.51 -X LEARNER ENGAGEMENT ASSOCIATES WITH BETTER LEARNING OUTCOMES IN BOTH ONLINE SETTINGS AND OFFLINE CLASSROOM SETTINGS AND IN THE RECENT YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A
utt_0028 utt 175.51 187.54 -X LOT OF WORK THAT DISCUSSES THE NEED OF SCALABLE QUALITY ASSURANCE OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND ALSO SHOWS THE OPPORTUNITY OF BUILDING SPECIFIC QUALITY
utt_0030 utt 187.54 199.67 -X INSTRUMENTS WHICH ARE TOOLS THAT ADDRESS SPECIFIC OR SUB PARTS OF THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS. WHEN WE LOOK AT LITERATURE OUTSIDE EDUCATION SUCH AS
utt_0032 utt 199.67 212.36 -X DOMAINS SUCH AS INFORMATION RETRIEVAL WE CAN SEE THAT MACHINE LEARNING MODELS HAVE BEEN USED TO PREDICT QUALITY AUTO PREDICT ENGAGEMENT. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES
utt_0034 utt 212.36 225.08 -X HERE IS THAT IT HAS BEEN USED TO PREDICT THE QUALITY OF WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES AND ALSO THERE HAVE BEEN WORK WHERE IT TRIES TO PREDICT THE ENGAGE-ABILITY OF WITH
utt_0036 utt 225.14 238.74 -X YOUTUBE LECTURES. WHEN WE FOCUS ON ENGAGEMENT OF VIDEO LECTURES THERE ARE A FEW NOTEWORTHY WORKS THAT HAS TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD AS WELL. ONE OF THOSE
utt_0038 utt 238.74 251.54 -X WORKS IS THE WORK FROM GUO AND THE GROUP HERE THEY FOCUS ON MOOC VIDEOS AND USE MEDIAN NORMALIZED ENGAGEMENT TIME AS A SUITABLE PROXY FOR LEARNER ENGAGEMENT.
utt_0040 utt 251.54 263.17 -X MISSING PART LIMITATION OF THIS WORK IS THAT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ENGAGE ABILITY IS DONE IN A QUALITATIVE SENSE. THEN THERE ARE OTHER WORKS THAT FOCUS ON
utt_0042 utt 263.17 274.25 -X YOUTUBE VIDEOS SUCH AS WOO ET AL. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM WITH THESE WORKS IS THAT IT DOESN'T FOCUS TYPICALLY ON EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS AND WHEN
utt_0044 utt 274.25 280.15 -X WE LOOK AT THE RESEARCHERS FROM YOUTUBE THERE HAVE BEEN WORK THAT SHOWS WHY
utt_0045 utt 281.01 294.13 -X WATCH TIME RELATED ENGAGEMENT METRICS COULD BE MORE RELIABLE COMPARED TO FOR EXAMPLE POPULARITY BASED ENGAGEMENT METRICS SUCH AS CLICKS BECAUSE OF ITS ROBUSTNESS
utt_0047 utt 294.71 303.24 -X TO PHENOMENON SUCH AS CLICK BAIT. IN ORDER TO BUILD A CONTEXT AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT
utt_0048 utt 303.24 315.65 -X PREDICTION MODEL THAT CAN RANK VIDEO LECTURES WE DEVISED A METHODOLOGY THAT CONSISTS OF SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS THAT ANSWER THE six RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT WE
utt_0050 utt 315.65 328.82 -X SET OUT IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS RESEARCH. WE IDENTIFY MEDIAN NORMALIZED ENGAGEMENT TIME TO BE THE BEST LABEL THAT CAN BE USED AS A PROXY FOR LEARNER ENGAGEMENT.
utt_0052 utt 328.98 340.98 -X THEN WE CREATE THREE DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF ENGAGEMENT REPRESENTATIONS USING THE MEDIAN ENGAGEMENT TIME BASED ON THE LITERATURE
utt_0054 utt 340.98 345.43 -X FROM SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT AND ALSO PAIRWISE COMPARISON LITERATURE.
utt_0055 utt 348.02 359.93 -X BASED ON THE LITERATURE THAT WE SAW WE ALSO IDENTIFIED FEATURES THAT ARE EASILY EXTRACTABLE FROM VIDEO LECTURE TRANSCRIPTIONS. THESE FEATURES ARE
utt_0057 utt 359.93 370.01 -X DIVIDED INTO TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THE CONTENT-BASED FEATURES THAT ARE CROSS MODAL FEATURES THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED ACROSS DIFFERENT MODALITIES
utt_0059 utt 370.01 383.45 -X SUCH AS PDFS OR VIDEO LECTURES AND ALSO VIDEO BASED FEATURES THAT ARE VERY MODALITY-SPECIFIC TO VIDEOS THEMSELVES. THESE FEATURES BELONG TO BOTH CONTINUOUS
utt_0061 utt 383.45 394.14 -X AND CATEGORICAL VARIABLE TYPES, AND WE CATEGORIZE THESE VARIABLES INTO THE QUALITY VERTICALS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN OUR PREVIOUS WORK.
utt_0063 utt 396.08 406.65 -X NOW THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LABELS AND THE FEATURES, WE CAN CREATE AND CONSTRUCT THE IDEAL DATA SET THAT WE CAN USE IN ORDER TO BUILD
utt_0065 utt 406.65 421.08 -X A PREDICTION MODEL. TO DO THAT WE USE THE DATA FROM WWW.VIDEOLECTURES.NET , AN OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE REPOSITORY THAT KEEPS RESEARCH TALKS FROM PEER-REVIEWED
utt_0067 utt 421.08 433.34 -X CONFERENCES. FROM THIS DATA SOURCE WE IDENTIFIED FOUR THOUSAND SIXTY THREE VIDEO LECTURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BETWEEN SEPTEMBER one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine AND OCTOBER two thousand and seventeen
utt_0069 utt 434.81 447.16 -X AND WE USED HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND USER VIEW EVENTS. THEN AS PART OF THE EXPERIMENT WE TRIED TO EMPIRICALLY ASSESS THE PREDICTABILITY OF
utt_0071 utt 447.16 458.55 -X MEDIAN ENGAGEMENT FROM THESE VIDEO LECTURES USING POPULAR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS AND WE ALSO USE SHAP ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE FEATURE INFLUENCE.
utt_0073 utt 460.31 473.69 -X NOW LET US LOOK AT SOME NOTABLE RESULTS. HERE WE USE PAIRWISE RANKING ACCURACY WITH FIVE FOLD CROSS VALIDATION IN ORDER TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MODELS
utt_0075 utt 475.16 480.38 -X WHERE KERNELELIZED MODELS ARE USED WE USE THE RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION (RBF) KERNEL.
utt_0076 utt 481.53 492.94 -X FROM THESE RESULTS WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THE RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR MODEL WITH THE RAW REPRESENTATION OF NORMALIZED MEDIAN ENGAGEMENT TIME (MNET) GIVES THE BEST
utt_0078 utt 492.94 503.82 -X PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE. IN THE NEXT SECTION IT TAKE THIS BEST PERFORMING MODEL AND WE FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS MODEL TO ANSWER THE REMAINING
utt_0080 utt 503.82 516.44 -X RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FROM THE SUB FIGURE (A) IN THIS SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THE SHAP ANALYSIS THAT WE CONDUCTED. SOME NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS HERE IS THAT THE
utt_0082 utt 516.44 529.08 -X WORD COUNT IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FEATURE WHEN IT COMES TO PREDICTING ENGAGEMENT WITH VIDEO LECTURES. WHAT YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS PLOT IS THAT THE MORE
utt_0084 utt 529.08 534.04 -X THE WORD COUNT IS FOR A PARTICULAR VIDEO LECTURE THE LESS ENGAGING IT GETS,
utt_0085 utt 534.65 547.24 -X SIMILARLY YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT THE MORE RECENT A LECTURE IS WHICH MEANS IF IT HAS A LATER PUBLISHER DATE THAT LEADS TO HIGHER ENGAGEMENT WHICH MEANS
utt_0087 utt 547.24 555.74 -X MORE FRESH MATERIAL GETS MORE MEDIAN ENGAGEMENT. MOST OF THESE FINDINGS FROM
utt_0088 utt 555.74 570.20 -X THE FUTURE INFLUENCE IS SENSIBLE AND WE SEE THEM ALIGNING WITH THE FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS WORK. WE CAN ALSO SEE FROM SUB FIGURE (B) HOW THE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC
utt_0090 utt 570.20 584.12 -X MODEL IS USEFUL IN A COLD-START SCENARIO. TO EXPLAIN THIS PLOT BRIEFLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE TAKE THE MOST ACTIVE USERS. WE HAVE TAKEN A SUBSET OF
utt_0092 utt 584.12 596.75 -X USERS FROM OUR DATA SET AND THEN WE HAVE USED THE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC MODEL AND A PERSONALIZED MODEL TO PREDICT THE ENGAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL EVENTS AND THEN
utt_0094 utt 596.75 611.58 -X WE HAVE CALCULATED THE MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR OF THESE PREDICTIONS AND CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PREDICTIONS, WHERE THE TWO PREDICTIONS ARE ONE COMING FROM THE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC MODEL AND ONE COMING FROM THE CONTEXTUAL
utt_0097 utt 611.58 623.97 -X MODEL OR THE PERSONALIZED MODEL. WHAT YOU CAN OBSERVE FROM THE SUBPLOT (B) IN THIS FIGURE IS THAT THE LESS NUMBER OF EVENTS THERE IS IN THE TRAINING DATA OR THE
utt_0099 utt 623.97 635.49 -X LESS NUMBER OF EVENTS THERE IS FOR A USER THE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC MODEL'S MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR (MAE) IS LESS, COMPARED TO THE CONTEXTUAL OR THE PERSONALIZED MODEL,
utt_0101 utt 635.61 650.01 -X WHICH MEANS UNTIL YOU GET ABOUT sixty TO seventy EVENTS IN THIS DATA SET FROM AN INDIVIDUAL USER THE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC MODEL GIVES BETTER PREDICTIONS OF
utt_0103 utt 650.01 662.05 -X ENGAGEMENT COMPARED TO THE PERSONALIZED MODEL. THIS DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF A CONTEXT AGNOSTIC MODEL THAT WE HAVE CREATED IN A COLD-START SCENARIO WHERE
utt_0105 utt 662.05 672.45 -X WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF USER DATA, THEN WE ALSO FURTHER INVESTIGATED HOW THE MODALITY SPECIFIC FEATURES AND THE
utt_0107 utt 672.45 684.37 -X DOMAIN-SPECIFIC DATA WOULD IMPACT THE PREDICTIONS. IN THE FIRST TABLE ON THE TOP WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE MACHINE LEARNING
utt_0109 utt 684.37 694.26 -X MODEL THAT ONLY USES CONTENT-BASED FEATURES WHICH IS THE CROSS MODEL FEATURES IN COMPARISON TO THE FEATURE SET WHERE THERE ARE THE CROSS MODEL
utt_0111 utt 694.26 705.82 -X FEATURES PLUS THE VIDEO SPECIFIC OR MODALITY SPECIFIC FEATURES. HERE YOU CAN OBSERVE THAT BY ADDING THE MODALITY SPECIFIC FEATURES WE ARE GETTING A SMALL
utt_0113 utt 705.82 716.77 -X INCREMENT OF THE PAIRWISE ACCURACY PERFORMANCE. BUT SOMETHING NOTEWORTHY HERE IS THAT JUST BY USING CONTENT-BASED FEATURES ALONE WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE
utt_0115 utt 716.86 728.35 -X SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACCURACY IN COMPARISON TO THE INCREMENT THAT YOU GET BY ADDING MODALITY-SPECIFIC FEATURES. IN THE SECOND TABLE BELOW WHAT YOU CAN SEE
utt_0117 utt 728.35 741.41 -X WHAT WE DID WAS WE USED DATA FROM LECTURES THAT BELONG TO STEM SUBJECTS VERSUS OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS SUCH AS SOCIAL SCIENCE, BUSINESS STUDIES AND
utt_0119 utt 741.41 753.25 -X WE TRIED TO BUILD TWO DIFFERENT MODELS FOR THESE TWO SUBJECT CATEGORIES AND TRIED TO COMPARE THAT WITH A SUBJECT AGNOSTIC MODEL THAT TRAINS ON ALL THE
utt_0121 utt 753.25 765.38 -X LECTURES, REGARDLESS OF THE DOMAIN CATEGORY THAT THEY BELONG TO. FROM THIS TABLE WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT BY USING ALL THE DATA WITHOUT SEPARATING OUT THE
utt_0123 utt 765.38 778.05 -X DATA AS STEM AND MISCELLANEOUS AND TRAINING TWO SEPARATE MODELS CONTRARY TO THAT IF YOU USE ALL THE DATA AND TRAIN ONE CONTEXT AGNOSTIC ENGAGEMENT
utt_0125 utt 778.05 791.31 -X PREDICTION MODEL, YOU ACHIEVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE. SO WHAT CONCLUSIONS CAN WE DERIVE FROM THIS WORK? ONE OF THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS THAT WE CAN DERIVE IS
utt_0127 utt 791.31 802.47 -X THAT PREDICTING ENGAGEMENT INVOLVES NONLINEAR FEATURES THAT ARE BETTER CAPTURED BY KERNELIZED MODELS OR ENSEMBLE MODELS SUCH AS RANDOM FOREST
utt_0129 utt 802.47 807.25 -X MODEL THAT BEST IN THIS ANALYSIS. WE HAVE ALSO
utt_0130 utt 808.29 820.29 -X SHOWN THAT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE CAN BE ACHIEVED JUST BY USING CROSS MODEL FEATURES TO PREDICT ENGAGEMENT. WE SAW THAT THE LENGTH OF A
utt_0132 utt 820.29 826.56 -X LECTURE PLAYS A CORE ROLE IN HOW ENGAGE-ABLE A VIDEO LECTURE IS.
utt_0133 utt 827.39 839.99 -X IN OUR EXPERIMENT WE ALSO DEMONSTRATED AND SHOWED THAT A CONTEXT AGNOSTIC PREDICTION MODEL CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THE COLD-START PROBLEM WHEN THERE ARE NO
utt_0135 utt 840.54 854.24 -X USER DATA AVAILABLE AND WE ALSO SEE THAT A DOMAIN AGNOSTIC MODEL IS SUFFICIENT FOR DOING ENGAGEMENT PREDICTION. BASED ON THIS WORK WE SEE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS.
utt_0137 utt 854.88 866.63 -X ONE OF THOSE LIMITATIONS IS THE LACK OF AUTHORITY OR TOPIC COVERAGE RELATED FEATURES IN THIS DATA SET AND THEN WE ALSO SEE THAT WE ONLY USED VERY EASILY
utt_0139 utt 866.63 877.86 -X AUTOMATABLE FEATURES IN THIS DATA SET AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS DATA SET WE ALSO HAVE A MAJORITY OF ENGLISH VIDEO LECTURES IN THIS DATA WHICH DRIVES US TO
utt_0141 utt 877.86 892.55 -X OUR FUTURE DIRECTIONS. THE CODE AND THE DATA SET FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE LINK GIVEN HERE. IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS WORK PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT US. THANK YOU!
