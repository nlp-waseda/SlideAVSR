utt_0000 utt 0.35 7.18 -X HI EVERYONE, THIS IS LEI ZHANG AND I’M A PHD STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
utt_0002 utt 7.18 18.87 -X I AM VERY HAPPY TO PRESENT VRGIT: A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM FOR COLLABORATIVE CONTENT CREATION IN VIRTUAL REALITY THIS WORK IS DONE BY ME, ASHUTOSH, MY ADVISORS
utt_0004 utt 18.93 21.39 -X DR. STEVE ONEY AND DR. ANHONG GUO.
utt_0005 utt 24.30 31.92 -X VIRTUAL REALITY CAN ENABLE INTUITIVE AND COMPELLING EXPERIENCES FOR USERS TO EXPLORE threeD CONTENT COLLABORATIVELY.
utt_0007 utt 32.14 41.55 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IMMERSIVE AUTHORING TOOLS CAN LEVERAGE USERS’ SPATIAL CAPABILITIES FOR CONTENT CREATION TASKS SUCH AS URBAN PLANNING IN VR.
utt_0009 utt 42.51 48.34 -X RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT SUPPORTING COLLABORATIVE CONTENT CREATION REQUIRES RICH HISTORY-KEEPING,
utt_0010 utt 48.34 53.94 -X SO THAT USERS CAN REVERT TO PREVIOUS STATES OR EXPLORE DIFFERENT DESIGN ALTERNATIVES.
utt_0011 utt 53.94 66.02 -X FURTHERMORE, AS MODERN WORKFORCES IN CREATIVE DOMAINS ARE BECOMING DIVERSE IN TERMS OF THEIR SKILL SETS AND BACKGROUNDS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION
utt_0013 utt 66.02 70.87 -X AMONG VARIOUS ROLES INCLUDING DESIGNERS, DEVELOPERS, AND CUSTOMERS.
utt_0014 utt 72.02 79.64 -X VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN USED WIDELY FOR KEEPING TRACK OF VERSION HISTORY OF DIGITAL CONTENT AMONG COLLABORATORS.
utt_0016 utt 79.64 88.31 -X HOWEVER, MOST CURRENT VCSS, SUCH AS GIT, ARE DESIGNED FOR TEXT RATHER THAN SPATIAL DATA SUCH AS threeD SCENES.
utt_0018 utt 88.31 97.40 -X FOR EXAMPLE, A DIFF VIEW OF CHANGES OF A threeD MODEL USING GIT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SEMANTIC INFORMATION OTHER THAN JUST LINE DIFFERENCES.
utt_0020 utt 97.78 109.78 -X A RECENT STUDY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT VERSION CONTROL FOR CREATIVE DOMAINS SHOULD BE DESIGNED BASED ON THE NEEDS OF CREATIVE PROCESSES AS CREATIVE PRACTITIONERS COULD PRIORITIZE DIFFERENT
utt_0022 utt 109.78 114.68 -X VALUES FROM THOSE IN THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING DOMAIN.
utt_0024 utt 122.04 130.39 -X MECHANISMS ON twoD DISPLAYS, BUT STILL LACKS KNOWLEDGE REGARDING HOW TO ENABLE MULTIPLE USERS TO TRACK VERSION HISTORY IN VR.
utt_0026 utt 132.12 145.11 -X IN OUR WORK, WE INVESTIGATE HOW WE CAN DESIGN THE VISUALIZATION AND INTERACTIONS OF A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM IN VR THAT SUPPORTS COLLABORATIVE AWARENESS AND COMMUNICATION.
utt_0028 utt 145.11 151.10 -X WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LET ME INTRODUCE VRGIT, A COLLABORATIVE VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM IN VR.
utt_0030 utt 152.08 158.27 -X NOW IMAGINE AN INTERIOR DESIGNER IS DESIGNING MULTIPLE DESIGN SOLUTIONS FOR AN APARTMENT IN VR.
utt_0032 utt 158.65 165.66 -X THEY CAN CREATE AND MANIPULATE threeD FURNITURE DIRECTLY IN VR USING OUR SYSTEM.
utt_0033 utt 165.66 173.18 -X VRGIT CAN THEN RECORD THE USER’S OPERATIONS AND VISUALIZE A HISTORY GRAPH, ANCHORED TO THE USERS’ NON-DOMINANT ARM.
utt_0035 utt 174.01 179.74 -X INSIDE THE HISTORY GRAPH, EACH NODE IS REPRESENTED USING A MINIATURE OF THE VERSION STATE.
utt_0036 utt 179.83 186.27 -X THE COLOR OF EACH OBJECT IN THE MINIATURE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION.
utt_0038 utt 186.27 193.76 -X FOR EXAMPLE, YELLOW REPRESENTS CHANGING OF AN OBJECT, RED MEANS DELETION AND GREEN MEANS ADDITION.
utt_0040 utt 193.76 203.52 -X IF THE DESIGNER IS UNSATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT DESIGN OR MAKES A MISTAKE, THEY CAN EASILY GO TO THE PREVIOUS STATE BY NAVIGATING THE HISTORY GRAPH USING THE CONTROLLER.
utt_0042 utt 204.12 212.83 -X NOW, LET’S SUPPOSE THE DESIGNER JUST FINISHED ONE DESIGN, BUT WANTS TO EXPLORE AN DESIGN ALTERNATIVE OF THE SOFA, LIKE THIS.
utt_0044 utt 214.52 219.56 -X USING VRGIT, THEY CAN EASILY CREATE A BRANCH BASED ON A PREVIOUS VERSION
utt_0045 utt 220.98 225.25 -X THEN THEY CAN KEEP ON WORKING ON THAT BRANCH BY CREATING A DIFFERENT SOFA.
utt_0046 utt 226.68 233.18 -X AS A RESULT, THE HISTORY GRAPH CAN VISUALIZE MULTIPLE BRANCHES TO THE USER.
utt_0047 utt 233.18 237.89 -X IF THE DESIGNER WANTS TO PREVIEW A DIFFERENT VERSION WITHOUT CHANGING THEIR CURRENT WORKSPACE,
utt_0048 utt 237.89 246.46 -X THEY CAN PULL UP A PREVIEW OF THE VERSION IN THE HISTORY GRAPH, WHICH IS A LARGER MINIATURE OF THE VERSION.
utt_0050 utt 246.46 252.54 -X THEY CAN ALSO CREATE MULTIPLE PREVIEWS OF DESIGN ALTERNATIVES AND COMPARE THEM BY PUTTING THEM SIDE BY SIDE.
utt_0052 utt 252.54 260.70 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IT THE DESIGNER LIKES THE CHAIRS FROM OTHER VERSIONS OR BRANCHES, THEY CAN RE-USE THOSE CHAIRS BY SELECTING THEM IN THE PREVIEW.
utt_0054 utt 260.99 270.72 -X BEYOND SUPPORTING VERSION CONTROL IN VR, OUR SYSTEM ALSO FACILITATES COMMUNICATION AND WORKSPACE AWARENESS IN REAL-TIME COLLABORATION.
utt_0056 utt 270.72 273.86 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HERE ARE THE VIEWS FROM TWO USERS.
utt_0057 utt 274.04 288.19 -X IF WE FOCUS ON USER two, THE USER ON THE RIGHT, SHE WANTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DESIGN OF THE SOFA BUT DOESN’T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH HER COLLABORATOR, SO SHE CREATES A NEW BRANCH TO WORK ON A DIFFERENT DESIGN.
utt_0060 utt 288.19 296.58 -X BUT AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, WHEN THEY ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT BRANCHES, THEY MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF WHERE COLLABORATORS ARE OR SEE WHAT THEY ARE WORKING ON.
utt_0062 utt 296.58 304.67 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THE USER ON THE RIGHT IS MANIPULATING A DIFFERENT SOFA ON THE DIFFERENT BRANCH BUT THE OTHER USER HAS NO IDEA.
utt_0064 utt 304.67 314.31 -X VRGIT PROVIDES THIS AWARENESS BY FIRST ANCHORING MINI AVATARS IN THE HISTORY GRAPH SO USERS CAN KNOW WHICH VERSION/BRANCH THEIR COLLABORATORS ARE WORKING ON.
utt_0066 utt 315.13 327.33 -X IF A USER WANTS SOME QUICK FEEDBACK FROM THEIR COLLABORATOR, INSTEAD OF DISTURBING THEIR WORK CONTEXT AND ASKING THEM TO TELEPORT, THEY CAN QUICKLY CREATE A PORTAL THAT SHARES THE FIRST-PERSON VIEW TO EACH OTHER.
utt_0069 utt 327.36 337.80 -X THEY CAN THEN GIVE FEEDBACK TO EACH OTHER USING VOICE CHAT WITHOUT SWITCHING THEIR WORKSPACE AND ACTIVELY MONITOR AND UNDERSTAND THEIR COLLABORATOR’S ACTIVITIES.
utt_0071 utt 337.80 343.36 -X DURING A DISCUSSION WITH COLLABORATORS, IF THE USER WANTS TO REFER TO A SPECIFIC VERSION,
utt_0072 utt 343.36 351.62 -X IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER USER TO UNDERSTAND FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE EACH USER HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE LOCAL HISTORY GRAPH ON THEIR ARMS.
utt_0074 utt 352.48 362.95 -X TO REDUCE THIS SORT OF FRICTION, VRGIT INTRODUCES SHARED HISTORY VISUALIZATION, WHERE THE LOCAL HISTORY GRAPH MOVES TO A SHARED LOCATION IN THE VIRTUAL SCENE.
utt_0076 utt 362.95 367.08 -X SIMILAR TO SCREEN SHARING, A USER CAN START SHARING THEIR HISTORY GRAPH.
utt_0077 utt 367.14 373.61 -X THEIR OPERATIONS ARE THEN SYNCED TO EVERY USER TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME VIEW AND UNDERSTANDING.
utt_0079 utt 373.61 382.09 -X HERE, INSTEAD OF GOING TO A DIFFERENT VERSION BY HERSELF, THE SHARER CAN BRING EVERYONE IN THE ROOM TO THAT VERSION.
utt_0081 utt 382.09 387.11 -X THEY CAN ALSO HAVE A SHARED PREVIEW AND DISCUSS WHICH DESIGN THEY WANT TO REUSE COLLECTIVELY.
utt_0082 utt 387.11 394.53 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN COLLECTIVELY DECIDE TO REUSE THE DESK AND THE CHAIR IN A DISCUSSION.
utt_0083 utt 394.53 400.68 -X WITH ALL THESE TECHNIQUES COMBINED, INCLUDING HISTORY KEEPING, BRANCHING, PREVIEWING, REUSING,
utt_0084 utt 400.68 411.30 -X COLLABORATIVE EDITING, PORTALS, AND SHARED HISTORY VISUALIZATION, OUR SYSTEM IS AIMED FOR SUPPORTING A COMPLETE MULTI-USER MULTI-BRANCH VERSION CONTROL IN VR.
utt_0086 utt 411.97 424.07 -X WE CONDUCTED A LAB STUDY WITH fourteen PARTICIPANTS, WITH THE GOAL OF EVALUATING THE USABILITY AND UTILITY OF VRGIT, AND THE COMMUNICATION AND AWARENESS IN A COLLABORATIVE TASK.
utt_0088 utt 424.07 431.59 -X DURING THE STUDY, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO DESIGN THE FLOOR PLAN OF AN APARTMENT BOTH INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLABORATIVELY.
utt_0090 utt 431.59 434.63 -X WE COLLECTED DATA THROUGH SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS.
utt_0091 utt 435.56 437.77 -X BELOW ARE SOME OF THE KEY FINDINGS.
utt_0092 utt 437.77 443.47 -X FOR THE USABILITY AND UTILITY OF VRGIT, WE FOUND THAT THE VISUALIZATION MAKES IT EASY
utt_0094 utt 450.57 463.75 -X STRUGGLED TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS LIKE WHICH BRANCH I’M ON OR HOW IT DIFFERS FROM OTHER BRANCHES, I REALLY LIKE THE VISUALIZATION OF THE VR SYSTEM, AND BEING ABLE TO SEE LITTLE PREVIEW MODELS OF THE ROOMS AND THE WAY THEY BRANCH.
utt_0097 utt 465.03 469.52 -X THE INTERACTION OF NAVIGATION INTRODUCES A LEARNING CURVE
utt_0098 utt 471.91 477.37 -X WHEN IT BECOMES LONGER, IT IS HARDER TO SEE AND NAVIGATE TO PREVIOUS VERSIONS
utt_0099 utt 483.56 487.31 -X PORTALS ENABLE CONVENIENT COMMUNICATION ON IDEAS
utt_0100 utt 490.06 500.03 -X WITH PORTALS YOU DON’T HAVE TO STEP OUT FROM YOUR ROOM TO ACTUALLY GO TO THE SECOND ROOM, YOU CAN JUST BE IN YOUR ROOM, AND JUST FROM THERE YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
utt_0103 utt 508.33 519.28 -X IF I ACTUALLY DIDN’T AGREE WITH MY COLLABORATOR’S FINAL DESIGN...I CAN SAY ‘OKAY, ACTUALLY I LIKE WHAT YOU DID IN VERSION three HERE, CAN WE BRANCH OFF OF VERSION three AND EXPLORE SOMETHING ELSE HERE?’
utt_0106 utt 519.28 532.88 -X AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THIS SHARED VISION COLLECTIVELY, IT GIVES THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BRANCH OFF OF THE DESIGN FINALLY, LET’S DISCUSS SOME DESIGN IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCHERS TO BUILD VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS IN VR.
utt_0109 utt 533.07 539.38 -X FIRST, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT NAVIGATING LONGER HISTORY CAN BE CHALLENGING USING EXISTING INTERACTIONS.
utt_0111 utt 539.38 548.59 -X FUTURE WORK COULD INVESTIGATE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MORE SOPHISTICATED CLUSTERING METHODS OR INCORPORATING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESOLUTION OF THE HISTORY GRAPH.
utt_0113 utt 548.94 560.16 -X SECOND, WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING SWIFT COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHOUT BREAKING THE USER’S CURRENT WORKING CONTEXT SUCH AS USING PORTALS, AND PROVIDING SHARED UNDERSTANDING AMONG COLLABORATORS
utt_0115 utt 560.16 564.08 -X SUCH AS USING A SHARED HISTORY VISUALIZATION.
utt_0116 utt 564.08 574.48 -X FINALLY, IF WE THINK ABOUT THE CREATIVE PROCESS OF PRODUCING VR CONTENT, MANY ASPECTS MIGHT TAKE PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS PROGRAMMING AND DEBUGGING.
utt_0118 utt 574.48 581.20 -X FUTURE RESEARCH COULD THUS EXPLORE A HYBRID FORM OF VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM THAT BRIDGES BOTH THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF VR.
utt_0120 utt 581.84 596.08 -X TO SUM UP, WE PRESENTED A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM THAT ENABLES USERS TO NAVIGATE HISTORY AND CREATE BRANCHES OF threeD SCENES, AND SUPPORTS SHARING AND DISCUSSION IN COLLABORATION PLEASE SEE OUR PAPER FOR MORE INSIGHTS AND TECHNICAL DETAILS.
utt_0123 utt 596.08 597.36 -1.2301 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
