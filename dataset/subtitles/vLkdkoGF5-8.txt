utt_0014 utt 62.77 76.90 -X YOU SEE HERE THE RESULT PAGE OF A CURRENT ARGUMENT SEARCH ENGINE FOR THE QUESTION OF WHETHER BANNING PLASTIC BAGS IS GOOD YOU CAN SEE SOME PROS AND CONS AND YOU MIGHT FIND SOMETHING YOU HAVE

utt_0028 utt 131.13 138.91 -X SYSTEMS SHOULD BE CONVERSATIONAL BUT ALSO THAT THESE SYSTEMS NEED AN INTERFACE THAT ALLOWS TO FORMULATE QUESTIONS

utt_0036 utt 167.07 173.26 -X POINT AND TO GET THERE WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPECTATIONS TOWARDS AN ARGUMENT SEARCH SYSTEM
utt_0038 utt 173.82 177.18 -X SO WE INVESTIGATED THESE EXPECTATIONS IN TWO WAYS
utt_0039 utt 177.78 189.60 -X AN ONLINE SURVEY THAT I WILL DETAIL NOW AND A USER STUDY WITH A SIMULATED SYSTEM THAT I WILL DETAIL LATER IN THIS TALK WE HIRED A TOTAL OF five hundred PEOPLE FROM ten
utt_0041 utt 189.60 201.92 -X COUNTRIES TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR SURVEY AFTER A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO ARGUMENT SEARCH THE SURVEY COLLECTED EXPECTATIONS ON WHEN WHY AND HOW THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD
utt_0044 utt 201.92 216.86 -X LIKELY USE ARGUMENT SEARCH WE HERE FOCUS ON THE WHY FOR WHICH WE SELECTED SIX MOTIVATIONS THAT COVER THE CATEGORIES OF DECIDING ON SOMETHING AND CONVINCING SOMEBODY BASED ON A DISTINCTION FROM AUGMENTATION
utt_0048 utt 216.86 227.46 -X RESEARCH AS WELL AS ENTERTAINMENT WE ADDED THE LAST CATEGORY AS FUN IS CONNECTED TO BOTH VOICE INTERFACES AND ARGUMENTATIVE DISCUSSIONS
utt_0051 utt 228.64 233.81 -X WE ASKED EACH PARTICIPANT THE SAME QUESTION FOR EACH OF THE SIX MOTIVATIONS
utt_0052 utt 234.56 237.75 -X IF VOICE BASED ARGUMENT SEARCH WERE AVAILABLE TODAY
utt_0053 utt 237.95 240.93 -X HOW LIKELY WOULD YOU USE IT WITH THIS MOTIVATION
utt_0054 utt 241.60 256.13 -X IN ADDITION TO A FIVE-POINT RATING PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE COMMENTS FOR EACH MOTIVATION WE ALSO CLARIFIED EACH MOTIVATION WITH AN EXAMPLE SCENARIO AS THIS GRAPH SHOWS ALL SELECTED
utt_0057 utt 256.13 259.71 -X MOTIVATIONS DO COVER A WIDE RANGE IN TERMS OF POPULARITY
utt_0058 utt 261.95 267.19 -X BETWEEN AS FEW AS twenty-five AND AS MANY AS seventy-three PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS
utt_0059 utt 267.26 271.72 -X STATED AN EXTREMELY OR VERY LIKELY USE OF THE DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS
utt_0060 utt 272.32 275.75 -X THE ENTERTAINMENT MOTIVATIONS ARE DEEMED THE MOST LIKELY
utt_0061 utt 275.84 290.15 -X AND MANY PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY USE AN ARGUMENT SEARCH SYSTEM TO HAVE FUN WITH A FRIEND OF COURSE SYSTEM DESIGNERS MIGHT CHOOSE TO IGNORE THE ENTERTAINMENT ASPECT FOR REASONS OF TRUSTWORTHINESS HOWEVER
utt_0064 utt 290.18 299.75 -X THIS RESULT ALSO SUGGESTS THAT PEOPLE MAY WANT TO PERFORM ARGUMENT SEARCHED TOGETHER WITH OTHERS THE PARTICIPANTS WERE LESS OPTIMISTIC
utt_0066 utt 299.75 313.96 -X FOR THE MOTIVATION OF CONVINCING OTHERS HOWEVER SOME PARTICIPANTS GAVE A COMMENT ON THESE MOTIVATIONS THAT THEY WOULD FEAR TO BE EMBARRASSED BY THE SYSTEM PROVIDING SILLY ARGUMENTS YOU CAN THUS EXPECT THAT SOME PEOPLE
utt_0069 utt 313.96 319.50 -X WOULD RATHER USE THE ARGUMENT SEARCH AND PREPARATION WHEN A PERSON TO BE CONVINCED IS NOT PRESENT
utt_0071 utt 320.16 323.27 -X FOR THE DECISION MAKING MOTIVATIONS FINALLY
utt_0072 utt 323.33 337.38 -X WE OBSERVE A LARGE DIFFERENCE IF WE AGAIN LOOK AT THE COMMENTS WE SEE THAT MANY PARTICIPANTS SAW VOTING AS TOO IMPORTANT AND FEAR THE MANIPULATION OF THE SYSTEM TO SUMMARIZE WE FOUND THAT THE
utt_0075 utt 337.38 348.65 -X PARTICIPANTS EXPECTED TO USE VOICE BASED ON CONVERSATIONAL ARGUMENT SEARCH ESPECIALLY FOR MOTIVATIONS OF LOW RISK BUT CAN IMAGINE A USE BOTH ALONE AND
utt_0077 utt 348.65 357.93 -X TOGETHER WITH OTHERS HAVING COLLECTED THE BROAD EXPECTATIONS WE ADDITIONALLY CONDUCTED A DETAILED USER STUDY WITH
utt_0079 utt 357.96 370.59 -X eighteen PARTICIPANTS THE PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED FOUR ARGUMENT SEARCH TASKS EACH WHILE BEING CONNECTED TWICE ONLY TO A HUMAN INTERMEDIARY WHO SIMULATED THE ARGUMENT SEARCH SYSTEM
utt_0082 utt 371.14 376.08 -X WE THEN MANUALLY TRANSCRIBED SEGMENTED AND CATEGORIZED EACH UTTERANCE
utt_0083 utt 376.68 385.42 -X SO WHEN WE ANALYZED THE CATEGORIES WE FOUND THAT THE PARTICIPANTS USED ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF ACTIONS ON INQUIRIES REVEALMENTS
utt_0085 utt 385.86 388.78 -X AS WELL AS GENERIC AND NAVIGATIONAL ACTIONS
utt_0086 utt 389.29 393.53 -X THE INQUIRIES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT FOR SYSTEM DESIGN
utt_0087 utt 394.12 402.06 -X MOST WERE ABOUT GETTING ARGUMENTS BUT ABOUT A FIFTH WERE ABOUT GETTING CONTEXT INFORMATION FOR SOMETHING FROM PREVIOUS ARGUMENT
utt_0089 utt 402.19 405.07 -X LIKE WORD DEFINITIONS OR PRODUCT FEATURES
utt_0090 utt 405.55 418.35 -X IN THE ONLINE SURVEY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE PARTICIPANTS STATED THEY WOULD NEED THE POSSIBILITY TO ASK THE SYSTEM FOR THE SOURCE OF AN ARGUMENT OR FOR FURTHER EVIDENCE BUT SUCH
utt_0093 utt 418.35 420.96 -X INQUIRIES OCCURRED VERY RARELY IN OUR STUDY
utt_0094 utt 421.74 434.67 -X ONE REASON COULD BE THAT THE PARTICIPANTS QUESTIONED THE ARGUMENTS LESS THAN USUAL IN OUR STUDY AS FOR ONE THEY WERE TALKING TO A HUMAN AND SECOND THEY DID NOT HAVE TO DECIDE ON SOMETHING FOR REAL
utt_0097 utt 435.18 448.11 -X HOWEVER THIS WOULD IMPLY THAT ONCE AN ARGUMENT SEARCH SYSTEM GAINED THE TRUST OF A USER IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF INDICATING PROBLEMATIC SOURCES OR DOUBTFUL EVIDENCE
utt_0100 utt 449.84 463.28 -X TO CONCLUDE I HERE PRESENTED SOME OF OUR RESULTS ON THE QUESTION OF WHY WHEN AND HOW PEOPLE EXPECT TO PERFORM VOICE-BASED ARGUMENT SEARCH WE HOPE TO HAVE SHOWN THAT ARGUMENTS
utt_0103 utt 463.28 475.57 -X SEARCHED BY ITS NATURE ASK FOR A CONVERSATIONAL FORM OF INTERACTION AND THAT ULTIMATELY THE TRUST THAT USERS PUT IN THE SYSTEM DETERMINES WHICH QUESTIONS THEY ASK BUT
utt_0106 utt 475.57 479.70 -X SHOULD ALSO DETERMINE WHAT THE SYSTEM PROVIDES WITHOUT BEING ASKED
