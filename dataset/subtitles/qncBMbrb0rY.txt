utt_0000 utt 0.13 5.33 -X HELLO, MY NAME IS JAYLIN HERSKOVITZ, AND I’M A fourTH YEAR PHD CANDIDATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.
utt_0002 utt 5.58 14.24 -X TODAY I’LL BE PRESENTING OUT PAPER TITLED: ‘HACKING, SWITCHING, COMBINING: UNDERSTANDING AND SUPPORTING DIY ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY DESIGN BY BLIND PEOPLE’
utt_0004 utt 14.61 21.68 -X THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY MY CO-AUTHORS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: ANDI XU, RAHAF ALHARBI, AND ANHONG GUO.
utt_0007 utt 27.79 31.46 -X TEND TO ASSUME ‘UNIVERSAL’ NEEDS OF BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE AND ARE THUS
utt_0010 utt 40.98 44.63 -X THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATION SEEING AI TO SORT MAIL.
utt_0011 utt 45.30 48.92 -X HOWEVER, WHEN THEY USED THEIR PHONE CAMERA TO SCAN THE ENVELOPE,
utt_0012 utt 49.33 54.48 -X INSTEAD OF JUST READING OUT THE INFORMATION THAT’S RELEVANT TO Pone, WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS THEIR NAME
utt_0014 utt 54.83 59.96 -X THE APP FRUSTRATED Pone BY READING ALL THE TEXT IT COULD SEE REPETITIVELY.
utt_0015 utt 59.96 65.46 -X IN RESPONSE, Pone IMAGINED BEING ABLE TO FILTER TEXT BASED ON SPECIFIC, RELEVANT PROPERTIES,
utt_0016 utt 65.46 68.95 -X IGNORING EVERYTHING ELSE AND REDUCING THEIR MENTAL LOAD.
utt_0017 utt 68.95 73.81 -X AND THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW Pone ENGAGED IN THE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY DESIGN PROCESS.
utt_0018 utt 74.42 83.32 -X FROM CASES LIKE THIS, AS WELL AS FROM PRIOR WORK, WE KNOW THAT BLIND PEOPLE ARE DOMAIN EXPERTS IN ENVISIONING, DESIGNING, AND ‘HACKING’ ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY.
utt_0020 utt 83.32 89.56 -X HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF LIMITATIONS IN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY DESIGN, INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OFTEN GO UNADDRESSED.
utt_0022 utt 89.56 96.66 -X IN RESPONSE TO SIMILAR ISSUES, DO-IT-YOURSELF OR DIY ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY MOVEMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THESE UNIQUE NEEDS.
utt_0024 utt 97.75 110.52 -X BVI PEOPLE ALREADY ENGAGE IN CUSTOMIZING AND DESIGNING THEIR OWN HIGH-TECH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO BETTER SUIT THEIR NEEDS AS EARLY-ADOPTERS AND DOMAIN EXPERTS IN MANY CAPACITIES, LIKE DEVELOPING SCREEN READER ADD-ONS.
utt_0027 utt 111.00 124.66 -X HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL A RANGE OF HIGH-TECH ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DIFFICULT TO ‘HACK’ AND ALTER AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DUE TO BOTH THE SKILL AND RESOURCES REQUIRED, AND THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SOME ALTERATIONS DUE TO CLOSED SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEMS.
utt_0030 utt 124.85 128.50 -X BUT PEOPLE STILL DEVELOP THEIR OWN WORKAROUNDS WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES.
utt_0031 utt 128.85 134.14 -X THUS, IN THIS WORK, WE AIM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CURRENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY TINKERING BEHAVIORS
utt_0032 utt 134.17 138.62 -X SO THAT THEY CAN BE BETTER SUPPORTED BY FUTURE DIY TECHNOLOGY CREATION SYSTEMS.
utt_0035 utt 143.77 147.16 -X FIRST, WHY DO BLIND PEOPLE CUSTOMIZE EXISTING ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY?
utt_0036 utt 147.73 152.57 -X SECOND, HOW DO BLIND PEOPLE CUSTOMIZE AND ‘HACK’ ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY?
utt_0037 utt 153.24 158.78 -X FINALLY, HOW WOULD BLIND PEOPLE ENVISION CREATING ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE?
utt_0038 utt 158.78 162.33 -X WE ANSWER THESE THREE QUESTIONS THROUGH A MULTI-PART QUALITATIVE STUDY.
utt_0039 utt 162.58 174.24 -X FIRST, WE CONDUCTED AN INTERVIEW WITH PARTICIPANTS ON THEIR CURRENT USE OF EXISTING ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY, FOCUSING ON CASES WHERE THEY CUSTOMIZED, CREATED, OR ‘HACKED’ ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SUIT A UNIQUE NEED.
utt_0042 utt 174.55 180.38 -X NEXT, WE CONDUCTED A TWO-WEEK DIARY STUDY WHERE WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO RECORD ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY USE.
utt_0044 utt 180.79 188.99 -X WITH THESE FIRST TWO PARTS, WE AIM TO ANSWER RESEARCH QUESTIONS one AND two, THE WHY AND HOW OF CURRENT CUSTOMIZATION AND HACKING BEHAVIORS.
utt_0046 utt 189.11 203.45 -X FINALLY, WE CONDUCTED A SECOND INTERVIEW ASKING PARTICIPANTS TO ENVISION CREATING NEW ASSISTIVE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR THEIR DAY-TO-DAY TASKS, AND TO PROVIDE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THE CONCEPT OF DIY ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE, OUR THIRD RESEARCH QUESTION.
utt_0049 utt 203.51 209.25 -X FOR THIS STUDY, WE RECRUITED twelve BLIND ADULTS WHO RANGED IN AGES FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY NINE YEARS OLD.
utt_0051 utt 209.47 216.64 -X THESE PARTICIPANTS HAD A RANGE OF VISUAL ABILITIES IN TERMS OF LIGHT AND COLOR PERCEPTION, AND BECAME BLIND AT VARYING AGES.
utt_0053 utt 217.43 219.07 -X NOW JUMPING INTO OUR RESULTS.
utt_0054 utt 219.35 224.06 -X THROUGH OUR ANALYSIS OF THE SCENARIOS THAT PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED IN EACH PHASE OF OUR STUDY,
utt_0056 utt 224.48 234.78 -X WE HIGHLIGHT THE LONG-TAIL OF UNIQUE NEEDS AND GAPS IN CURRENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT DRIVE PARTICIPANTS TO DESIRE ADDITIONAL CUSTOMIZATION IN THEIR ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY.
utt_0058 utt 236.35 244.51 -X NEXT, WE AIMED TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE CURRENTLY CUSTOMIZE AND HACK ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY, SO THAT WE CAN BETTER SUPPORT THOSE BEHAVIORS IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0060 utt 244.51 253.19 -X WE CHARACTERIZE HOW PARTICIPANTS WORKED AROUND GAPS IN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY LIKE THESE USING THREE MAIN STRATEGIES: HACKING, SWITCHING, AND COMBINING.
utt_0062 utt 253.19 262.53 -X WHEN ‘HACKING’, PARTICIPANTS OFTEN USED ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN A WAY THAT IT WAS NOT ORIGINALLY INTENDED IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH NEW TASKS, AND THUS DISCOVERED NEW IDEAS
utt_0064 utt 262.94 271.75 -X WITH THE ‘SWITCHING’ STRATEGY, PARTICIPANTS SWITCH BETWEEN APPLICATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR DEFICIENCIES IN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY EITHER IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF A TASK, OR WHEN
utt_0067 utt 274.21 279.14 -X FINALLY, WITH THE COMBINING STRATEGY, PARTICIPANTS USED MULTIPLE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES AT ONCE
utt_0068 utt 279.17 282.08 -X AS A WAY TO BLEND FEATURES FROM MULTIPLE SERVICES.
utt_0069 utt 282.69 297.04 -X EACH OF THESE STRATEGIES HAS ITS PROS AND CONS, AND AS Pten DESCRIBED, FIGURING OUT THE RIGHT APPROACH INVOLVES SOME TRIAL AND ERROR, IN THEIR WORDS: ‘IT’S A LOT OF TINKERING.’ WE DESCRIBE THESE INSTANCES AS A FORM OF DESIGN THROUGH USE, AND
utt_0072 utt 297.04 301.28 -X HERE I’LL HIGHLIGHT ONE SCENARIO WHERE THE ‘HACKING’ STRATEGY WAS USED BY A PARTICIPANT
utt_0073 utt 301.92 305.64 -X Pfour DESCRIBED A SITUATION WHERE THEY WANTED TO ORGANIZE BOOKS ON THEIR SHELF.
utt_0074 utt 306.37 310.89 -X AS A SOLUTION, Pfour DREW SIMPLE LABELS AS A SET OF SHAPES ON STICKY NOTES.
utt_0075 utt 310.95 315.78 -X THEY THEN PLACED THESE ON THEIR BOOKSHELF SO THAT EACH LABEL CORRESPONDED WITH A GENRE OF BOOKS.
utt_0077 utt 316.64 319.94 -X THEY USED SEEING AI TO IDENTIFY THESE LABELS WHEN NEEDED.
utt_0078 utt 320.23 327.59 -X THIS IS A DIY APPROACH TO CREATING LABELS THAT CAN BE ACCESSED NON-VISUALLY, CREATED BY Pfour AS THEY BECAME BLIND.
utt_0081 utt 443.24 447.92 -X FINALLY, PARTICIPANTS ENVISIONED THEMSELVES TAKING ON DIFFERENT ROLES IN THE CREATION PROCESS.
utt_0083 utt 448.17 457.20 -X SOME ENVISIONED THE PROCESS AS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THOSE WITH DIFFERENT SKILL SETS, FOR EXAMPLE Pseven SAID: ‘I COULD SEE MYSELF MAYBE AS PART OF A FOCUS GROUP?
utt_0086 utt 457.20 458.16 -X OR A THINK TANK?’
utt_0087 utt 458.64 464.08 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS COULD ALSO BE DUE TO NOT HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO CREATION IN THE PAST.
utt_0089 utt 465.29 468.50 -X AS Pten SAID: ‘I GUESS I HAVEN’T REALLY THOUGHT OF IT.
utt_0090 utt 468.50 472.91 -X BECAUSE IT’S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU LEAVE TO THE EXPERTS AND HOPE THAT THEY GET WHAT YOU WANT.’
utt_0092 utt 474.03 483.34 -X GIVEN THIS VARIATION, SUPPORTING USERS IN WHICHEVER CAPACITY THEY DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE IS KEY TO EXPANDING DIY CREATION TOOLS IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0094 utt 483.34 488.05 -X BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE SUMMARIZE GOALS FOR SUPPORTING DIY CREATION IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0095 utt 488.05 502.45 -X THESE INCLUDE: IMPROVING THE APPROACHABILITY OF CREATING TECHNICALLY COMPLEX SYSTEMS FOR NON-PROGRAMMERS SUPPORTING DIFFERENT ROLES AND COLLABORATION IN THE DIY PROCESS AND WORKING TO ADDRESS THE ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES
utt_0098 utt 502.45 505.30 -X PRESENT WHEN CREATING VISUAL OR CAMERA-BASED TECHNOLOGIES.
utt_0099 utt 506.03 512.79 -X FINALLY, FROM THESE GOALS, WE CONSIDER END-USER PROGRAMMING AS A POTENTIAL APPROACH TO DIY ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE
utt_0101 utt 513.49 523.60 -X END USER PROGRAMMING GENERALLY AIMS TO MAKE TECHNICAL CREATION MORE APPROACHABLE, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH BLOCK-BASED PROGRAMMING APPROACHES, ALTHOUGH THESE CURRENTLY HAVE ACCESSIBILITY LIMITATIONS
utt_0104 utt 524.11 531.28 -X THESE APPROACHES COULD ALSO SUPPORT A SHARED REPOSITORY OF TOOLS TO SUPPORT COLLABORATION BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXPERTISE
utt_0106 utt 531.92 542.52 -X ADDITIONALLY, IN OUR PAPER, WE DESCRIBE HOW COMMON USE CASES BROUGHT UP BY PARTICIPANTS THROUGHOUT OUR STUDY MAP TO EXISTING APPROACHES SUCH BLOCK-BASED PROGRAMMING.
utt_0108 utt 542.52 554.17 -X TO SUMMARIZE, IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENTED AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BVI PEOPLE CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY CUSTOMIZATION AND DESIGN, AND HOW THEY ENVISION DIY-ING ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE.
