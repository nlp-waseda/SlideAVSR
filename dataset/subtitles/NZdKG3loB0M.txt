utt_0001 utt 0.82 5.78 -X IS THIS THE DREAM WHERE I’M RELIVING DIFFICULT QUESTIONS FROM MY THESIS DEFENSE?
utt_0002 utt 5.78 9.94 -X M: WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT YOU’RE ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS HERE?
utt_0003 utt 9.94 14.32 -X P: OH, THAT MUST MEAN THAT I’M SUPPOSED TO BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR EMNLP
utt_0006 utt 18.19 19.86 -X P: OUR PAPER HAS TWO GOALS.
utt_0007 utt 19.86 26.87 -X WE SEEK ANSWERS TO TWO QUESTIONS: WHY DO WE---AS QA RESEARCHERS--WORK ON QUESTION ANSWERING?
utt_0009 utt 26.87 32.91 -X HOW DO DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO THIS QUESTION INFLUENCE PAST AND PRESENT RESEARCH, AND WHAT SHOULD WE CHANGE?
utt_0012 utt 35.06 39.63 -X P: YOU MUST BE REPRESENTING THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM, FRIENDLY INFORMATION SEEKING QUESTIONS.
utt_0013 utt 39.63 42.77 -X M: AND WHY AREN’T YOU EXPLAINING WHO I AM?
utt_0014 utt 42.77 48.40 -X P: YOU’RE NEW AND SCARY, AND I HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIT YOU INTO THE NARRATIVE
utt_0016 utt 50.58 51.44 -X SLIDE: WHAT IS QA?
utt_0017 utt 51.44 53.08 -X C: SO WHAT IS QUESTION ANSWERING?
utt_0019 utt 57.40 62.55 -X LANGUAGE PROCESSING TO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ANSWER QUESTIONS POSED BY HUMANS.
utt_0020 utt 62.93 67.38 -X SLIDE: EXAMPLES OF QUESTION ANSWERING C: WHAT APPLICATIONS DOES QUESTION ANSWERING
utt_0022 utt 67.57 74.61 -X M: PUT ANOTHER WAY, WHAT MOTIVATES A QA RESEARCHER TO WORK ON SUCH A PROBLEM?
utt_0023 utt 74.61 79.80 -X P: ONE REASON HUMANS ASK QUESTIONS IS TO FIND INFORMATION THEY DON’T HAVE.
utt_0024 utt 80.08 83.48 -X THIS IS THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM FROM INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
utt_0025 utt 83.63 88.34 -X IF I ASK A SEARCH ENGINE OR AN ASSISTANT A QUESTION LIKE: “WHO WAS CYRIL CLEVERDON?”,
utt_0026 utt 88.53 91.96 -X IT'S BECAUSE I DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER AND WOULD LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT HIM.
utt_0027 utt 92.21 101.40 -X WITH THAT IN MIND, ONE REASON TO WORK ON QA IS SO THAT WHEN HUMANS ASK QUESTIONS, MACHINES ARE BETTER AT FINDING GENUINELY USEFUL INFORMATION.
utt_0029 utt 101.40 107.26 -X M: BUT IF USERS ONLY ASK EASY QUESTIONS, THEN OUR MACHINES DON’T HAVE TO BE THAT GOOD.
utt_0030 utt 107.26 109.94 -X ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ASK?
utt_0032 utt 113.30 116.57 -X ON JEOPARDY!, WHEN ALEX TREBEK ASKS QUESTIONS LIKE
utt_0033 utt 116.63 127.42 -X THE CAPTCHA TEST AGAINST SPAM &AMP ROBOT PROGRAMS IS CALLED THE ‘REVERSE’ TEST NAMED FOR THIS BRITISH CODE BREAKER M: ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT ALEX TREBEK DOESN’T KNOW THE ANSWER?
utt_0036 utt 127.42 132.06 -X P: UNLIKE THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM, THE ASKER KNOWS THE ANSWER.
utt_0037 utt 132.28 137.75 -X JUST LIKE AN ANNOYING TEACHER, THEY ASK BETTER AND HARDER QUESTIONS.
utt_0038 utt 138.10 145.50 -X IN QA, THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS (AS EVIDENCED BY WATSON ON JEOPARDY!) ENCOURAGE US TO BUILD SMARTER MACHINE QA SYSTEMS.
utt_0040 utt 145.50 147.42 -X SLIDE: WHAT IS AN EVALUATION PARADIGM?
utt_0044 utt 157.34 158.46 -X AND MANY OTHER DECISIONS.
utt_0047 utt 167.35 168.76 -X OF THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE.
utt_0049 utt 173.47 174.01 -X MORE.
utt_0050 utt 174.01 177.50 -X M: HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU FOCUS ON?
utt_0051 utt 178.49 189.05 -X SLIDE: CRANFIELD EXPERIMENTS P: IN THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM, THE MAIN GOAL IS MAKING SURE THAT QA SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MORE BROADLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR USERS.
utt_0057 utt 197.31 202.33 -X AND THE CREATOR OF THE CRANFIELD “EXPERIMENTAL TRADITION... [WHICH] WORKING WITH CARD INDEXES,
utt_0058 utt 202.33 207.42 -X A HALF CENTURY AGO” SPURRED A REVOLUTION IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL EVALUATION.
utt_0060 utt 210.37 214.65 -X PARADIGM, AS FURTHER DEVELOPED BY ELLEN VOORHEES AND OTHERS AT NIST WITH TREC.
utt_0062 utt 217.85 224.00 -X HERE’S A QUESTION FOR YOU, WHAT DO I REPRESENT, IN CONTRAST TO THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM?
utt_0063 utt 224.57 230.72 -X P: THIS PAPER NAMES AND OUTLINES THE MANCHESTER PARADIGM WHICH TAKES INSPIRATION FROM ALAN
utt_0065 utt 234.91 237.70 -X MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY SLIDE: THE TURING TEST C: WHAT’S THE TURING TEST?
utt_0075 utt 257.63 262.66 -X WHAT IT IS THAT AI MUST ENDEAVOUR TO EVENTUALLY ACCOMPLISH SCIENTIFICALLY&GT.
utt_0076 utt 262.66 272.51 -X TURING’S CHALLENGE TO THOSE OF USE WORKING IN UNIVERSITIES TODAY IS TO BUILD SYSTEMS THAT---BASED ON THE QUESTIONS THEY ANSWER---ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS
utt_0078 utt 272.67 280.07 -X SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR DEMONSTRATING HUMAN-LIKE INTELLIGENCE.
utt_0079 utt 280.07 284.13 -X M: IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE CONNECTED TO MANCHESTER THAT RELATES TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID?
utt_0082 utt 286.37 288.93 -X C: WHAT’S UNIVERSITY CHALLENGE?
utt_0084 utt 294.79 299.43 -X IN one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-two BY GRANADA STUDIOS IN MANCHESTER, IS A COMPETITION BETWEEN UK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.
utt_0085 utt 299.52 307.33 -X M: IN THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM, THE ASKER DOES NOT KNOW THE ANSWER, HOW DOES THAT DIFFER IN THE MANCHESTER PARADIGM?
utt_0088 utt 309.64 313.60 -X UNDER THE MANCHESTER PARADIGM, THE ASKER KNOWS THE ANSWER.
utt_0091 utt 322.89 331.97 -X MY GOAL IS TWOFOLD, TO TEST WHETHER YOU ARE CLEVER ENOUGH TO KNOW THE ANSWER AND TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO STRETCH YOUR MIND TO GET THE RIGHT ANSWER.
utt_0093 utt 331.97 333.48 -X SLIDE: WHAT IS A GOOD ANSWER?
utt_0095 utt 335.53 342.57 -X P: UNDER THE CRANFIELD PARADIGM, THE BEST TEST IS TO ASK USERS IF THE ANSWER WAS HELPFUL.
utt_0096 utt 342.82 350.60 -X BUT THIS IS EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO REPEAT, THE GENIUS OF CLEVERDON WAS TO INVENT THE IDEA OF RE-USABLE TEST COLLECTIONS.
utt_0098 utt 350.69 358.31 -X LIKE MODERN DATASET, FOR EVERY QUESTION, THE CORRECT DOCUMENT OR ANSWER IS MARKED AND USED TO AUTOMATICALLY SCORE MACHINE SYSTEMS.
utt_0100 utt 358.31 360.97 -X SLIDE: WHAT IS A GOOD ANSWER?
utt_0101 utt 360.97 368.01 -X M: WHAT ABOUT ANSWERS THAT WHILE THEY MIGHT HELP THE USER, DON'T NECESSARILY SHOW THAT MACHINES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE CORRECT ANSWER?
utt_0103 utt 368.96 378.60 -X P: ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION WITH ANSWER APOLLO, WHICH COULD REFERENCE THE NASA PROGRAM, THE DEITY, OR A FICTIONAL CHARACTER.
utt_0105 utt 378.92 385.96 -X UNDER THE MANCHESTER PARADIGM, EXTRA CARE IS PAID TO DETERMINING WHICH APOLLO THE ANSWERER MEANT.
utt_0107 utt 386.31 393.96 -X FOR EXAMPLE, WE MIGHT ASK FOR THE CORRESPONDING WIKIPEDIA ENTITY, PHRASE THE QUESTION MULTIPLE WAYS, OR MORE.
utt_0110 utt 398.47 407.47 -X P: THIS HELPS SEARCH ENGINES PROVIDE BETTER CONTEXT AND BUILD USER TRUST, BY SHOWING THAT THE SEARCH ENGINE HAD A GOOD INTERPRETATION OF THE USER'S INTENT.
utt_0112 utt 407.47 416.40 -X SLIDE: ADVERSARIAL QUESTION ANSWERING M: SO NAMING AND DISTINGUISHING THESE IS HELPFUL INFORMATION, BUT DOES IT SHED LIGHT ON OTHER CURRENT TOPICS OF DEBATE?
utt_0116 utt 418.57 419.85 -X C: WHAT’S AN ADVERSARIAL QUESTIONS?
utt_0120 utt 430.09 430.92 -X ANSWER IT CORRECTLY.
utt_0123 utt 436.84 437.48 -X FIX IT STYLE.
utt_0124 utt 437.48 440.04 -X C: DO USERS ASK HARD QUESTIONS?
utt_0131 utt 458.89 461.10 -X FUNDING AND THE GOALS OF ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY RESEARCH?
utt_0132 utt 461.10 465.68 -X P: WHILE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS, THE MAJORITY OF INDUSTRY RESEARCH, ESPECIALLY APPLIED RESEARCH,
utt_0133 utt 465.68 469.71 -X GOES TOWARDS IMPROVING HOW WELL QA AND IR SYSTEMS HELP USERS.
utt_0135 utt 473.74 476.85 -X M: DO YOU HAVE A MORE GENERAL TAKEAWAY FROM YOUR PAPER?
utt_0136 utt 476.85 478.06 -X P: OF COURSE!
utt_0137 utt 478.06 481.94 -X WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCHERS TO THINK HARDER ABOUT: “WHY ARE WE WORKING ON THIS TASK?”
utt_0139 utt 485.26 487.66 -6.9309 WE ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO KEEP ASKING THIS QUESTION!
