utt_0000 utt 0.38 4.69 -X WE PRESENT OUR PAPER ON REPRESENTING SPATIAL TRAJECTORIES AS DISTRIBUTIONS.
utt_0001 utt 5.23 11.70 -X THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER IS SPATIAL TRAJECTORIES, SUCH AS THIS ONE REPRESENTING HUMAN MOVEMENT.
utt_0007 utt 31.38 34.61 -X WORKING WITH TRAJECTORIES ENTAILS A SERIES OF CHALLENGES.
utt_0008 utt 34.61 37.85 -X AS WE JUST MENTIONED, IN MOST SETTINGS, ONLY PART OF THE TRAJECTORY IS OBSERVED.
utt_0009 utt 38.19 43.57 -X EITHER THE FUTURE, OR THE PAST, IS MISSING, OR THE TRAJECTORY IS OCCLUDED BEHIND OTHER OBJECTS.
utt_0010 utt 44.15 51.73 -X ALSO, TRAJECTORIES ARE CONTINUOUS IN TIME, AND WHILE WE ONLY GET DISCRETE OBSERVATIONS OF THEM, IT IS CONVENIENT TO REPRESENT THEM AS A CONTINUOUS SIGNAL.
utt_0012 utt 52.28 56.66 -X AND FINALLY, IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW A METRIC BETWEEN TRAJECTORIES CAN BE DEFINED.
utt_0013 utt 56.82 59.16 -X WHAT MAKES TWO TRAJECTORIES SIMILAR?
utt_0014 utt 60.15 67.26 -X WE PROPOSE A REPRESENTATION LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR TRAJECTORIES THAT DEALS WITH ALL THESE CHALLENGES IN A UNIFIED WAY.
utt_0016 utt 67.26 71.67 -X SPECIFICALLY, WE PROPOSE REPRESENTING SEGMENTS OF TRAJECTORIES AS PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS.
utt_0017 utt 71.86 75.93 -X THESE DISTRIBUTIONS REPRESENT ALL THE POSSIBLE TRAJECTORIES THE SEGMENT COULD BELONG TO.
utt_0018 utt 76.95 81.56 -X FOR THIS EXPLANATION, WE WILL REPRESENT PARTIAL TRAJECTORIES WITH THESE SIMPLIFIED ARROWS.
utt_0019 utt 81.75 84.28 -X THIS PINK ARROW REPRESENTS THE FIRST CLIP WE SAW.
utt_0021 utt 92.34 99.90 -X THESE SEGMENTS ARE PART OF A LONGER TRAJECTORY, AND OUR GOAL IS TO REPRESENT THEM IN A LEARNED LATENT SPACE, WHERE WE CAN MODEL THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM.
utt_0023 utt 100.89 105.60 -X SPECIFICALLY, WE REPRESENT THEM AS DISTRIBUTIONS IN THIS SPACE.
utt_0024 utt 105.60 109.25 -X EVERY SEGMENT REPRESENTATION ENCODES ALL THE POSSIBLE TRAJECTORIES IT CAN BELONG TO.
utt_0025 utt 109.69 116.06 -X IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, ALL THE POINTS INSIDE OF THE RECTANGLE CORRESPOND TO DIFFERENT POSSIBLE TRAJECTORIES.
utt_0026 utt 116.19 124.45 -X IN ORDER TO TRAIN THE ENCODER, WE USE THE FOLLOWING INTUITION: BOTH THE PINK AND THE BLUE SEGMENTS HAVE BEEN SAMPLED FROM THE SAME TRAJECTORY.
utt_0028 utt 124.45 127.42 -X THEREFORE, THERE HAS TO BE AN OVERLAP BETWEEN THEIR REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0029 utt 127.97 132.39 -X ALL THE POINTS IN THIS OVERLAP WILL BE POSSIBLE TRAJECTORIES THESE TWO SEGMENTS ARE PART OF.
utt_0030 utt 132.89 136.77 -X FOLLOWING THIS INTUITION, OUR LOSS ENCOURAGES THIS OVERLAP TO BE LARGE.
utt_0031 utt 138.27 149.60 -X IN ADDITION TO THE PAST SEGMENT, IN PINK, AND THE FUTURE SEGMENT, IN BLUE, WE CAN SAMPLE OTHER SEGMENTS FROM THE INPUT TRAJECTORY, SUCH AS THE YELLOW ONE, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE COMBINATION OF THE OTHER TWO.
utt_0034 utt 149.60 155.84 -X THE REPRESENTATION OF THIS SEGMENT IN THE LATENT TRAJECTORY SPACE WILL CORRESPOND TO THE INTERSECTION OF THE OTHER TWO REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0036 utt 156.29 163.27 -X WE CAN INCLUDE THIS INFORMATION, WHICH BY THE WAY WE GET FOR FREE WITHOUT ANY SUPERVISION, IN THE ENCODER LOSS.
utt_0037 utt 163.27 169.48 -X IN ADDITION TO FINDING GOOD REPRESENTATIONS FOR TRAJECTORIES, WE CAN DECODE THEM INTO INPUT SPACE POINTS.
utt_0039 utt 169.48 173.80 -X IN ORDER TO DO SO, WE CAN SAMPLE A TRAJECTORY FROM A GIVEN DISTRIBUTION IN THE LATENT SPACE,
utt_0040 utt 174.15 176.68 -X AND DECODE IT INTO A POINT AT A SPECIFIC TIME T.
utt_0041 utt 177.44 181.99 -X T IS A CONTINUOUS VARIABLE, WHICH ALLOWS US TO MODEL TRAJECTORIES AS A CONTINUOUS SIGNAL.
utt_0042 utt 183.17 187.82 -X WE TRAIN THE DECODER NETWORK BY REGRESSING THE PREDICTED POINT TO THE GROUND TRUTH INITIAL POINT.
utt_0043 utt 189.38 195.27 -X IN ADDITION TO THE THREE SEGMENTS SHOWN BEFORE, WE CAN DEFINE MANY MORE SEGMENTS, AND THE DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM.
utt_0045 utt 195.72 201.93 -X EACH ONE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS CAN BE ADDED TO THE ENCODER LOSS, WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN ITS FORMULATION.
utt_0047 utt 201.93 206.06 -X THE LOSS WILL EITHER MINIMIZE OR MAXIMIZE THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THEIR REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0048 utt 207.43 212.11 -X IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, WE MODEL THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF HUMAN SKELETON KEYPOINTS.
utt_0049 utt 212.30 215.31 -X OUR MODEL CAN PERFORM SEVERAL TASKS AT INFERENCE TIME.
utt_0050 utt 215.72 218.83 -X WE FIRST SHOW SOME EXAMPLES OF FUTURE PREDICTION.
utt_0051 utt 218.99 224.85 -X THE KEYPOINTS IN THE RGB FRAMES CORRESPOND TO THE PAST CONTEXT, THAT IS INPUT TO THE MODEL, AND THE REST OF THE VIDEO
utt_0052 utt 224.85 238.13 -X CORRESPONDS TO THE MODELâ€™S PREDICTION.
utt_0053 utt 238.22 242.38 -X OUR MODEL IS NOT CAUSAL, SO WE CAN ALSO PERFORM INTERPOLATION BETWEEN SEGMENTS.
utt_0055 utt 246.59 248.85 -X PREDICTION INTERPOLATES BETWEEN THESE TWO CLIPS.
utt_0056 utt 249.77 251.86 -X SO THIS IS PART OF THE INPUT OF THE MODEL,
utt_0057 utt 251.86 254.16 -X THIS IS THE MODEL'S PREDICTION,
utt_0058 utt 254.99 257.23 -X AND THIS IS ALSO PART OF THE INPUT TO THE MODEL.
utt_0059 utt 260.05 264.88 -X OUR PROBABILISTIC MODELING ALLOWS US TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE POSSIBLE TRAJECTORIES GIVEN A SEGMENT.
utt_0060 utt 264.98 270.74 -X IN THE SPECIFIC CASE OF FUTURE PREDICTION, DIFFERENT SAMPLES IN THE LATENT SPACE WILL RESULT IN DIFFERENT FUTURES.
utt_0062 utt 270.86 274.61 -X HERE WE SHOW A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE THREE OF SUCH SAMPLES ARE OVERLAPPED.
utt_0063 utt 282.39 288.66 -X FINALLY, WE CAN EDIT TRAJECTORIES BY FINDING DIMENSIONS IN THE LATENT SPACE THAT CORRESPOND TO DIFFERENT TRAJECTORY ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0065 utt 288.75 291.93 -X FOR EXAMPLE, WE CAN SLOW DOWN OR SPEED UP TRAJECTORIES.
utt_0066 utt 295.89 299.06 -X AND WE CAN ALSO ADD A TEMPORAL OFFSET TO THE TRAJECTORIES.
