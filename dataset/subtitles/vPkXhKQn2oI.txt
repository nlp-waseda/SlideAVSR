utt_0000 utt 0.18 2.45 -X HI, MY NAME IS PAUL-EDOUARD SARLIN.
utt_0001 utt 2.45 8.59 -X I AM A PHD STUDENT AT ETH ZURICH AND WILL NOW PRESENT OUR PAPER BACK TO THE FEATURE,
utt_0002 utt 8.59 12.56 -X IN WHICH WE LEARN ROBUST CAMERA LOCALIZATION FROM PIXELS TO POSE.
utt_0003 utt 12.56 16.71 -X THIS IS A JOINT WORK WITH AJAY UNAGAR AND MULTIPLE COLLABORATORS
utt_0004 utt 16.91 22.13 -X AT ETH ZURICH, CHALMERS, ÉCOLE DES PONTS, MICROSOFT, AND CTU PRAGUE.
utt_0005 utt 23.06 32.53 -X WE TACKLE THE TASK OF VISUAL LOCALIZATION, WHICH ESTIMATES THE ROTATION AND THE TRANSLATION OF A CAMERA IN A threeD ENVIRONMENT GIVEN A SINGLE QUERY IMAGE.
utt_0008 utt 32.69 35.09 -X WE ASSUME TO HAVE A MAP OF THE ENVIRONMENT,
utt_0009 utt 35.09 43.73 -X COMPOSED OF REFERENCES IMAGES WITH POSES AND A threeD MODEL, FOR EXAMPLE A SPARSE POINT CLOUD BUILT WITH STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION.
utt_0011 utt 43.73 48.50 -X OFTEN, WE ALSO HAVE A COARSE PRIOR ON THE POSE FROM IMAGE RETRIEVAL OR EVEN GPS.
utt_0012 utt 49.08 51.74 -X THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK IS PIXLOC,
utt_0013 utt 51.74 56.95 -X A LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT ESTIMATES THE POSE OF A GIVEN IMAGE.
utt_0014 utt 56.95 60.12 -X CURRENT APPROACHES TO THIS PROBLEM BELONG TO TWO CATEGORIES.
utt_0015 utt 60.25 63.19 -X THE CLASSICAL PIPELINE DETECTS LOCAL FEATURES,
utt_0016 utt 63.19 65.05 -X DESCRIBES AND MATCHES THEM,
utt_0017 utt 65.05 67.55 -X AND FINALLY SOLVES FOR THE POSE.
utt_0018 utt 67.55 72.35 -X MULTIPLE OF THESE BLOCKS CAN BE LEARNED INDIVIDUALLY BUT TRAINING END-TO-END IS DIFFICULT.
utt_0020 utt 72.57 80.89 -X INSTEAD, RECENT APPROACHES LIKE DSAC EMPLOY A SINGLE CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK TO REGRESS GEOMETRIC QUANTITIES LIKE threeD POINTS.
utt_0023 utt 81.37 88.35 -X THE CNN RECOGNIZES SPECIFIC SCENE FEATURES AND PREDICTS THEIR threeD COORDINATES OR THE CORRESPONDING VIEW POINT.
utt_0025 utt 88.83 96.67 -X THE WEIGHTS OF THE CNN THEREFORE ENCODE THE threeD STRUCTURE OR THE REFERENCE VIEWS AND OFTEN CANNOT GENERALIZE TO NEW SCENES.
utt_0027 utt 96.92 102.02 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT DEEP NETWORKS DO NOT NEED TO LEARN threeD GEOMETRY.
utt_0028 utt 102.43 105.76 -X INSTEAD, DEEP NETS SHOULD GO BACK TO THE FEATURE:
utt_0029 utt 105.76 112.74 -X THEY ONLY NEED TO LEARN GOOD FEATURES AND THE REGRESSION SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITH CLASSICAL GEOMETRY.
utt_0031 utt 112.74 114.53 -X LET'S HAVE A CLOSER LOOK AT PIXLOC.
utt_0032 utt 115.13 120.96 -X A CNN FIRST PREDICT DENSE FEATURES FOR THE QUERY AND FOR A CORRESPONDING REFERENCE IMAGE.
utt_0033 utt 120.96 124.16 -X GIVEN LOCAL threeD POINTS AND A COARSE INITIAL POSE,
utt_0034 utt 124.16 128.64 -X WE CAN COMPUTE THE ERROR BETWEEN QUERY AND REFERENCE FEATURES.
utt_0035 utt 128.64 132.84 -X A GEOMETRIC OPTIMIZATION THEN REFINES THE POSE BY ALIGNING THE FEATURES.
utt_0036 utt 133.51 140.36 -X THE OPTIMIZATION IS DIFFERENTIABLE SO THAT PIXLOC IS TRAINED END-TO-END BY BACKPROPAGATING TO THE FEATURES.
utt_0038 utt 141.03 145.77 -X BY TAKING THE threeD INFORMATION OUT OF THE NETWORK, THE FEATURES ARE GENERIC.
utt_0039 utt 145.92 150.25 -X OUR APPROACH IS SCENE AGNOSTIC AND GENERALIZES WELL ACROSS DOMAINS.
utt_0040 utt 150.56 156.55 -X THE DIRECT OPTIMIZATION MAKES IT VERY ACCURATE BUT ALSO INTERPRETABLE.
utt_0041 utt 156.55 157.87 -X LET’S VISUALIZE THE PROCESS.
utt_0042 utt 157.89 163.91 -X WE ISOLATE A LOCAL POINT CLOUD WITH IMAGE RETRIEVAL AND INITIALIZE PIXLOC WITH A REFERENCE POSE.
utt_0044 utt 164.29 171.53 -X THE FEATURE ALIGNMENT THEN ITERATIVELY REFINES THE POSE BY MINIMIZING A DIRECT FEATUREMETRIC COST UNTIL CONVERGENCE.
utt_0046 utt 171.59 177.61 -X HERE WE SHOW THE CURRENT REPROJECTIONS IN RED BUT PIXLOC DOES NOT RELY ON EXPLICIT CORRESPONDENCES.
utt_0048 utt 179.05 188.33 -X FOR EACH IMAGE, PIXLOC FIRST EXTRACTS DENSE FEATURES AND CORRESPONDING CONFIDENCE MAPS AT MULTIPLE LEVELS, FROM COARSE TO FINE.
utt_0050 utt 188.33 196.05 -X FOR EACH threeD POINT, THE FEATURES DEFINE A COST THAT IS WEIGHTED BY THE CONFIDENCE AND MINIMIZED USING GRADIENT-BASED OPTIMIZATION.
utt_0052 utt 196.59 202.29 -X PIXLOC ALSO ENCODES A REGULARIZATION LAMBDA THAT REFLECTS THE PRIOR ON THE CAMERA MOTION.
utt_0053 utt 202.99 208.98 -X WE OBTAIN AN UPDATED POSE, WHICH INITIALIZES THE OPTIMIZATION AT THE NEXT LEVEL, AND SO ON.
utt_0054 utt 209.68 214.00 -X PIXLOC IS TRAINED BY SUPERVISING ONLY THE FINAL POSES,
utt_0055 utt 214.00 217.97 -X AND THUS DOES NOT REQUIRE GROUND TRUTH threeD GEOMETRY.
utt_0057 utt 221.22 224.40 -X AND TO FOCUS ON DISTINCTIVE PARTS LIKE TREETOPS.
utt_0058 utt 224.88 230.08 -X IT CAN ALSO IGNORE SELF-SIMILARTIES THAT CREATE LOCAL-MINIMA IN THE OPTIMIZATION
utt_0059 utt 230.16 232.40 -X SUCH AS THE BRICK WALL SHOWN HERE.
utt_0060 utt 234.16 238.55 -X DIRECT ALIGNMENT USUALLY CANNOT HANDLE LARGE VIEWPOINT OR ILLUMINATION CHANGES.
utt_0061 utt 238.83 246.33 -X IN STARK CONTRAST, PIXLOC EXHIBITS A LARGE AND ROBUST BASIN OF CONVERGENCE THANKS TO THE MULTI-LEVEL FEATURES.
utt_0063 utt 249.75 252.73 -X BY LEARNING ONLY VISUAL FEATURES THAT ARE GENERIC,
utt_0064 utt 252.73 256.02 -X PIXLOC GENERALIZES WELL ACROSS ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0065 utt 256.28 265.37 -X A MODEL TRAINED ONLY ON OUTDOOR SCENES PROVIDES ACCURATE LOCALIZATION WITH INDOOR DATA THAT EXHIBITS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TEXTURE AND MORE MOTION BLUR
utt_0067 utt 268.21 274.65 -X WE PRESENTED PIXLOC, A SYSTEM THAT LEARNS TO ESTIMATE A CAMERA POSE FROM AN IMAGE, END-TO-END.
utt_0068 utt 274.71 280.67 -X IT IS ROBUST, ACCURATE, AND GENERALIZES WELL ACROSS DIFFERENT SCENES AND ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0069 utt 281.30 288.35 -X BY TRAINING END-TO-END, PIXLOC CAN LEARN POWERFUL TEMPORAL PRIORS FROM POSE SUPERVISION ONLY,
utt_0070 utt 288.35 293.05 -X SUCH AS DISTINGUISHING DYNAMIC AND STATIC OBJECTS LIKE CARS AND BUILDINGS.
utt_0071 utt 293.43 298.53 -X YOU CAN FIND THE PAPER, THE CODE, AND COOL INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS IN OUR WEBSITE.
utt_0072 utt 298.68 300.00 -0.5729 THANKS FOR WATCHING.
