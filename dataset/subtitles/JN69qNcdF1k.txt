utt_0000 utt 0.19 5.26 -X HI I'M VINCENT FROM THE SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING LAB AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON.
utt_0001 utt 5.71 16.59 -X I WILL BE PRESENTING OUR PAPER TITLED POLYNOMIAL MATRIX EIGENVALUE DECOMPOSITION -BASED SOURCE SEPARATION USING INFORMED SPHERICAL MICROPHONE ARRAYS.
utt_0003 utt 19.21 28.85 -X AUDIO SOURCE SEPARATION IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SPEECH ENHANCEMENT IN HEARING AIDS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS,
utt_0005 utt 28.85 32.56 -X threeD SOUND RENDERING AND ROBOT AUDITION.
utt_0006 utt 32.72 43.51 -X IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS, HOWEVER, IT IS OFTEN CHALLENGING TO ISOLATE THE TARGET SOURCE BECAUSE OF INTERFERING SOURCES, BACKGROUND AMBIENT NOISE,
utt_0008 utt 43.79 47.47 -X AND REVERBERATION ARISING FROM ROOM ACOUSTICS.
utt_0009 utt 48.40 54.10 -X THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE APPLICATIONS CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING A SOURCE SEPARATION ALGORITHM.
utt_0010 utt 55.92 61.84 -X EXISTING APPROACHES TO SOURCE SEPARATION INCLUDE MICROPHONE ARRAY PROCESSING
utt_0011 utt 62.00 67.44 -X WHICH CAN USE SPATIAL FILTERING TO POTENTIALLY ISOLATE SOURCES.
utt_0012 utt 67.44 78.10 -X THERE ARE ALSO INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (ICA)-BASED AND NON-NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION (NNMF)-BASED APPROACHES WHICH ARE
utt_0014 utt 78.10 82.51 -X SUCCESSFUL AT PERFORMING SEPARATION BUT MAY INTRODUCE PROCESSING ARTIFACTS.
utt_0015 utt 83.76 94.13 -X IN OUR EARLIER WORK, WE PROPOSED A POLYNOMIAL-EVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM THAT OPERATES ON EIGENBEAM SIGNALS FOR SPHERICAL ARRAYS.
utt_0018 utt 95.02 101.14 -X THE ALGORITHM CAN PROVIDE GOOD SPEECH ENHANCEMENT WITHOUT INTRODUCING ANY ARTIFACTS.
utt_0019 utt 101.81 106.29 -X IN THIS TALK, WE EXTEND THAT WORK TO SOURCE SEPARATION.
utt_0020 utt 109.58 113.72 -X THE PEVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM IS PRESENTED HERE.
utt_0021 utt 114.32 122.64 -X FOR SPHERICAL MICROPHONE ARRAY, WE FIRST COMPUTE THE EIGENBEAM SIGNALS AND FORM THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0023 utt 122.83 128.02 -X THIS IS THEN FED INTO THE PEVD ALGORITHM TO GENERATE THE EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS.
utt_0024 utt 128.88 133.04 -X THE EIGENBEAMS ARE THEN PROCESSED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK
utt_0025 utt 133.55 137.75 -X TO GENERATE THE ENHANCED SIGNAL IN THE FIRST CHANNEL.
utt_0026 utt 138.93 144.95 -X IN OUR EARLIER WORK, THE PROBLEM IS A SINGLE TALKER IN DIFFUSE NOISE.
utt_0027 utt 144.95 147.92 -X HERE, WE FOCUSED ON MULTIPLE LOCALIZED SOURCES.
utt_0028 utt 148.59 152.44 -X ASSUMING THAT THE DIRECTION OF ARRIVALS (DOAS) ARE PROVIDED,
utt_0029 utt 152.66 157.45 -X WE CAN USE THE EIGENBEAMS TO FORM SEVERAL MODAL BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS
utt_0030 utt 157.55 163.40 -X FOR EVERY TARGET. WE CAN THEN APPLY PEVD TO THE BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS
utt_0031 utt 163.73 167.13 -X AND RECOVER EACH TARGET SIGNAL.
utt_0032 utt 169.94 173.14 -X THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM IS SUMMARIZED HERE.
utt_0033 utt 173.17 178.13 -X WE FIRST COMPUTE THE EIGENBEAMS USING THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS ON THE SPHERICAL ARRAY.
utt_0034 utt 178.93 186.07 -X FOR EVERY TARGET SOURCE, WE USE PRIOR INFORMATION OF THE SOURCE DIRECTION TO GENERATE THE MODAL OUTPUTS,
utt_0035 utt 186.51 190.20 -X WHICH ARE THEN USED TO FORM THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0036 utt 190.90 199.29 -X THIS IS THEN USED AS THE INPUT INTO THE PEVD TO GENERATE THE EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS.
utt_0037 utt 199.29 209.40 -X MODAL OUTPUTS ARE THEN FILTERED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK AND THE TARGET SOURCE IS RECOVERED IN THE FIRST CHANNEL.
utt_0038 utt 209.40 220.95 -X THE RECEIVED SIGNAL AT X SUBSCRIPT Q IS THE SUM OF THE LOCALIZED SOURCES ARRIVING AT THE Q-TH MICROPHONE ON THE SPHERICAL ARRAY.
utt_0040 utt 221.14 223.91 -X 'H' HERE DENOTES THE ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSE
utt_0041 utt 224.47 227.00 -X FROM THE P-TH SOURCE TO THE Q-TH MICROPHONE,
utt_0042 utt 228.47 232.15 -X 'S' DENOTES THE P-TH LOCALIZED SOURCE SIGNAL,
utt_0043 utt 232.63 238.39 -X AND R HERE IS THE SPHERICAL COORDINATE WITH RADIUS R, ELEVATION ANGLE THETA,
utt_0044 utt 238.39 240.50 -X AND AZIMUTH ANGLE PHI.
utt_0045 utt 241.33 245.75 -X ACROSS Q SENSORS, WE CAN WRITE THE DATA VECTOR AS THE FOLLOWING.
utt_0046 utt 249.65 262.68 -X FOR SPHERICAL ARRAY, WE CAN REPRESENT AN ORDER-LIMITED SOUND FIELD USING SPHERICAL HARMONIC BASIS FUNCTIONS, R_L^M FOR THE L-TH ORDER AND M-TH DEGREE
utt_0048 utt 262.68 270.74 -X EIGENBEAM SIGNAL, CHI_L^M AND ALPHA_Q HERE REPRESENTS THE QUADRATURE WEIGHTS.
utt_0049 utt 270.96 275.10 -X IN THE INVERSE TRANSFORM, WE CAN RECOVER EACH MICROPHONE SIGNAL
utt_0050 utt 275.16 279.74 -X USING THE WEIGHTED SUM OF THE BASIS FUNCTIONS.
utt_0051 utt 279.74 283.32 -X THIS DIAGRAM SHOWS THE SPHERICAL HARMONIC BASIS FUNCTIONS.
utt_0052 utt 283.35 291.67 -X WE CAN, IN GENERAL, FORMULATE STANDARD BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS USING A LINEAR COMBINATION OF THESE BASIS FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE
utt_0054 utt 292.15 296.28 -X HYPERCARDIOID OR THE MAXIMUM DIRECTIVITY INDEX BEAMFORMER.
utt_0055 utt 297.40 305.24 -X NOTE THAT THE ZEROTH ORDER TERM HERE IS EQUIVALENT TO AN OMNIDIRECTIONAL SENSOR PLACED AT THE CENTER OF THE MICROPHONE ARRAY.
utt_0056 utt 305.56 309.98 -X IN THIS WORK, WE ALSO PROPOSE THE MODIFICATION TO THE HYPERCARDIOID
utt_0057 utt 310.71 318.39 -X WHICH EXCLUDES THIS ZERO ORDER TERM IN ORDER TO AVOID SOUND CAPTURE FROM UNDESIRED DIRECTIONS.
utt_0058 utt 318.39 328.92 -X GIVEN THE SOURCE DIRECTIONS, WE CAN GENERATE MODAL BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS WHICH CAN BE STEERED EIGENBEAMS, MAXIMUM DIRECTIVITY BEAMFORMER
utt_0060 utt 329.17 334.01 -X OR THE PROPOSED MODIFIED HYPERCARDIOID BEAMFORMER.
utt_0061 utt 334.01 340.38 -X NOW ASSUMING STATIONARITY, MODAL OUTPUTS ARE THEN USED TO COMPUTE THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0062 utt 340.57 348.54 -X EACH ELEMENT IN THIS SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX IS THE CROSS-CORRELATION FUNCTION BETWEEN THE MODAL OUTPUTS, I-TH AND J-TH,
utt_0064 utt 351.42 356.76 -X AND TAU HERE IS THE TIME SHIFT PARAMETER.
utt_0065 utt 356.76 362.97 -X THE Z TRANSFORM OF THIS SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX GIVES US A PARA-HERMITIAN POLYNOMIAL MATRIX, R PSI PSI.
utt_0067 utt 364.54 368.48 -X IN THIS TALK, WE USE CALLIGRAPHIC FONT FOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES
utt_0068 utt 368.54 370.68 -X AND REGULAR FONT FOR MATRICES.
utt_0069 utt 371.70 375.23 -X HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE MODAL OUTPUTS ON THE LEFT,
utt_0070 utt 375.23 378.01 -X AS WELL AS ITS SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0071 utt 378.52 383.76 -X THE DIAGONALS ARE COMPUTED USING THE AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTIONS OF THE MODAL SIGNALS
utt_0072 utt 384.09 389.28 -X WHEREAS THE OFF DIAGONALS ARE COMPUTED BASED ON THE CROSS CORRELATION FUNCTION
utt_0073 utt 389.46 391.87 -X BETWEEN THE BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS.
utt_0074 utt 391.87 399.45 -X SO, THIS WILL BE BETWEEN PSI ONE AND TWO, PSI ONE AND THREE, PSI ONE AND FOUR.
utt_0075 utt 399.45 409.89 -X THE PEVD OF R PSI PSI IS DEFINED AS THE FOLLOWING, WHERE LAMBDA AND U CONTAIN THE EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTORS.
utt_0076 utt 409.89 418.81 -X THE SUPERSCRIPT P IS THE PARA-HERMITIAN OPERATOR WHICH INCLUDES THE HERMITIAN TRANSPOSE OPERATION FOLLOWED BY A TIME-REVERSAL.
utt_0078 utt 419.13 424.75 -X THE SUBSPACE DECOMPOSED BY THE PEVD GENERATES STRONGLY DECORRELATED OUTPUTS
utt_0079 utt 425.21 430.05 -X WHICH MEANS THAT THE OUTPUTS ARE ORTHOGONAL WITHIN THE RANGE OF TAU.
utt_0080 utt 431.48 435.58 -X WE DENOTE S (IN BLUE) THE SUBSPACE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TARGET SOURCE
utt_0081 utt 436.03 440.93 -X AND 'S COMPLEMENT' (IN RED) AS THE INTERFERERS' SUBSPACES.
utt_0082 utt 444.92 454.94 -X THE PEVD OF THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX COMPUTED EARLIER IS SHOWN HERE AND ON THE LEFT, WE HAVE THE EIGENVALUE, AND ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE THE EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES.
utt_0085 utt 455.58 464.42 -X TO COMPUTE THE PEVD, WE CAN USE ANY OF THESE ALGORITHMS.
utt_0086 utt 464.42 468.42 -X MODAL SIGNALS ARE THEN FILTERED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK
utt_0087 utt 468.76 472.00 -X WHICH PRODUCES OUTPUTS THAT ARE STRONGLY DECORRELATED.
utt_0088 utt 473.28 478.24 -X BECAUSE THE TARGET SOURCE SIGNAL IN DIFFERENT MODAL OUTPUTS ARE SUM COHERENTLY
utt_0089 utt 478.56 482.78 -X AND THE SPECTRALLY MAJORIZED PROPERTY OF THE PEVD,
utt_0090 utt 483.52 488.93 -X THE TARGET SOURCE SIGNAL CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE FIRST CHANNEL.
utt_0091 utt 489.40 499.65 -X THE FOLLOWING TARGET OUTPUT SHOWN ON THE RIGHT IS PRODUCED BY FILTERING MODAL OUTPUTS ON THE LEFT THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK GENERATED EARLIER.
utt_0093 utt 503.16 508.67 -X THE FOLLOWING SETUP IS USED FOR OUR EXPERIMENT. SO, WE HAVE TWO FEMALE SPEAKERS
utt_0094 utt 509.21 513.95 -X AND THE SPEECH SIGNALS ARE OBTAINED FROM THE TIMIT CORPUS.
utt_0095 utt 513.95 516.45 -X THE TWO SOURCES ARE SPACED ninety DEGREES APART.
utt_0096 utt 517.37 520.96 -X THE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT WE FIRST CONSIDER IS ANECHOIC.
utt_0097 utt 526.01 531.59 -X WE COMPARED OUR ALGORITHM WITH TWO MODAL BEAMFORMER OUTPUTS NAMELY,
utt_0099 utt 535.68 543.84 -X AS WELL AS STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACHES THE AUXILIARY IVA (AUXIVA), ILRMA AND FASTMNMF,
utt_0100 utt 544.03 550.05 -X WHICH ARE BASED ON THE ICA AND NON-NEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION APPROACHES.
utt_0101 utt 551.07 555.78 -X WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ALGORITHM USING SOURCE SEPARATION METRICS
utt_0102 utt 556.73 559.49 -X SUCH AS THE SDR, SIR, SAR,
utt_0103 utt 559.77 565.86 -X WHICH ARE THE SIGNAL-TO-DISTORTION, -INTERFERENCE AND, -ARTIFACTS RATIO, RESPECTIVELY,
utt_0104 utt 565.86 569.57 -X AS WELL AS SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY AND QUALITY MEASURES
utt_0105 utt 569.73 574.43 -X STOI AND PESQ TO QUANTIFY ANY POTENTIAL SPEECH ARTIFACTS.
utt_0106 utt 576.32 585.32 -X FOR THIS EXAMPLE, THE PROPOSED PEVD OUTPERFORMS IN DELTA SDR, SAR, STOI AND PESQ,
utt_0107 utt 585.82 592.39 -X WHEREAS THE FASTMNMF APPROACH LEADS ALL ALGORITHMS IN DELTA SIR.
utt_0108 utt 593.60 599.78 -X ACROSS ALL METRICS, THE LARGER IMPROVEMENT OFFERED BY MHCARD OVER MAXDIR
utt_0109 utt 600.96 607.08 -X ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE ADVANTAGE OF EXCLUDING THE ZEROTH ORDER EIGENBEAM IN THE MODAL BEAMFORMER.
utt_0110 utt 608.00 609.89 -X LET US NOW LISTEN TO THE SIGNALS.
utt_0111 utt 610.66 612.90 -X HERE IS THE RECEIVED SIGNAL.
utt_0112 utt 612.90 614.31 -X &LT PLAYING RECEIVED SIGNAL &GT
utt_0115 utt 619.04 620.52 -X THE MODIFIED HYPERCARDIOID (MHCARD)
utt_0116 utt 620.52 625.70 -X &LT PLAYING MHCARD SIGNALS &GT RIGHT, LET'S HEAR THE RECEIVED AGAIN.
utt_0118 utt 625.70 628.20 -X &LT PLAYING RECEIVED SIGNAL &GT
utt_0119 utt 628.58 630.72 -X THE PEVD &LT PLAYING PEVD SIGNAL &GT
utt_0122 utt 633.57 638.31 -X AND THE NON-TARGET SPEECH SIGNALS ARE ATTENUATED BUT THEY REMAIN INTELLIGIBLE.
utt_0124 utt 638.53 642.72 -X LET'S COMPARE IT WITH THE FASTMNMF.
utt_0125 utt 642.72 644.42 -X &LT PLAYING FASTMNMF SIGNALS &GT
utt_0126 utt 645.12 647.94 -X I NOW PRESENT SOURCE SEPARATION RESULTS FOR
utt_0127 utt 648.19 650.47 -X A REVERBERANT ROOM WITH A Tsixty OF zero point seven SECONDS.
utt_0128 utt 653.19 659.40 -X THE SDR SCORE, ON THE LEFT, SHOWS THAT PEVD IN BLUE IS COMPARABLE TO ICA-BASED METHODS SHOWN IN PINK, RED AND ORANGE,
utt_0131 utt 659.91 662.02 -X AND IS, IN FACT, THE BEST IN STOI SCORE.
utt_0132 utt 662.02 668.61 -X SO IN THE PAPER, WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE POSITIONS OF SCENARIO ONE FOR TWO FEMALE SPEAKERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM
utt_0135 utt 671.75 673.77 -X AND THE DETAILS ARE IN THE PAPER.
utt_0139 utt 689.99 693.96 -X FOR SOURCE SEPARATION BUT DOES NOT ALWAYS OUTPERFORM THEM.
