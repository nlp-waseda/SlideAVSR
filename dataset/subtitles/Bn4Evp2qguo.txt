utt_0000 utt 0.24 4.53 -X OLEG ZENDEL WILL PRESENT THE PAPER
utt_0001 utt 44.81 45.49 -X OKAY
utt_0002 utt 45.74 54.64 -X SO HELLO EVERYONE I'M OLEG ZENDEL AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU OUR JOINT WORK TODAY WITH OREN KURLAND, ANNA SHTOK FIANA RAIBER AND SHANE CULPEPPER
utt_0005 utt 55.21 60.88 -X NOW JUST BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SIGIR FOR THE STUDENT TRAVEL GRANT
utt_0006 utt 61.10 72.53 -X SO AS YOU MIGHT HAVE GUESSED BY THE TITLE OF OUR PAPER OUR WORK IS IN THE AREA OF QPP WHICH STANDS FOR QUERY PERFORMANCE PREDICTION NOW THE TASK OF
utt_0008 utt 72.53 77.67 -X QPP IS ESTIMATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SEARCH PERFORMED IN RESPONSE TO A QUERY
utt_0009 utt 77.74 82.13 -X WHICH ASSUMINGLY REPRESENTS AN INFORMATION WITHOUT ANY RELEVANCE INFORMATION
utt_0010 utt 82.38 92.32 -X THERE ARE TWO COMMON APPROACHES IN QPP THE PRE-RETRIEVAL AND THE POST-RETRIEVAL APPROACH IN THE FIRST THE PRE-RETRIEVAL PREDICTORS THEY ANALYZE THE QUERY AND
utt_0012 utt 92.32 106.77 -X CORPUS STATISTICS PRIOR TO RETRIEVAL TWO EXAMPLES FOR SUCH PREDICTORS WE HAVE THE MAX IDF AND THE AVGSCQ PREDICTORS AND BOTH OF THEM ARE BASED ON THE SUB ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT MORE INFORMATIVE QUERY TERMS SHOULD RESULT IN A MORE
utt_0015 utt 106.77 119.59 -X EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL NOW FOR THE SECOND APPROACH THE POST-RETRIEVAL PREDICTORS THEY ADDITIONALLY TO THE QUERY AND CORPUS STATISTICS ALSO ANALYZE THE INFORMATION INDUCED FROM TOP RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS TWO EXAMPLES FOR SUCH
utt_0018 utt 119.59 131.04 -X PREDICTORS ARE THE CLARITY AND THE WIG PREDICTORS WHERE IN CLARITY CLARITY IS BASED ON DIVERGENCE BETWEEN LANGUAGE MODELS AND WIG UTILIZES
utt_0020 utt 131.66 145.56 -X INFORMATION FROM THE RETRIEVAL SCORES SO THE TASK OF QPP CAN BE FRAMED AS ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY OF A RELEVANCE EVENT GIVEN QUERY CORPUS AND
utt_0022 utt 145.56 149.20 -X A RETRIEVAL METHOD AND IN MOST OF THE PRIOR WORK ON QPP
utt_0023 utt 149.74 158.66 -X THE CORPUS AND THE RETRIEVAL METHOD WERE FIXED AND THE PROBABILITY WAS ESTIMATED FOR DIFFERENT QUERIES THEREFORE IN A WAY IT IS EQUIVALENT TO RANKING QUERIES
utt_0025 utt 158.70 172.21 -X BASED ON THEIR PRESUMED EFFECTIVENESS NOW AS WE CAN SEE IN THE RANDOM VARIABLES DEPENDENCIES GRAPH THE RESULT LIST IS DEPENDENT IN A QUERY CORPUS AND
utt_0027 utt 172.21 180.07 -X RETRIEVAL METHOD AND FOR A SPECIFIC QUERY SPECIFIC CORPUS AND A SPECIFIC RETRIEVAL METHOD WE RECEIVE A SINGLE RESULT LIST
utt_0029 utt 180.34 190.81 -X THEREFORE WE CAN RE-FRAME THE PROBABILITY AS IT APPEARS HERE WHICH IS ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY OF A RELEVANCE EVENT GIVEN A QUERY A
utt_0031 utt 190.81 201.01 -X AND A RETRIEVAL.. AND RESULT LIST SO FRAMING THE QPP TASK IN THIS WAY IS BASICALLY EQUIVALENT TO ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THIS RETRIEVED
utt_0033 utt 201.01 215.67 -X RESULT LIST IS RELEVANT TO THIS QUERY SO IN ALL IN ALL OF THE PREVIOUS WORK ON QPP THE INFORMATION NEEDS WERE REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE QUERY AND EACH QUERY
utt_0035 utt 215.92 227.48 -X REPRESENTED A DIFFERENT INFORMATION NEED THEREFORE RANKING DIFFERENT QUERIES WE WERE, ACTUALLY THE PREDICTORS WERE ACTUALLY RANKING DIFFERENT INFORMATION NEEDS AND IT
utt_0037 utt 227.48 237.78 -X WAS SHOWN IN A RECENT WORK THAT PRE-RETRIEVAL PREDICTORS THAT WERE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE CLASSICAL SETUP WHERE EACH DIFFERENT QUERY PRESENTED A
utt_0039 utt 237.78 251.06 -X DIFFERENT INFORMATION NEED THEY WERE SHOWN TO BE INEFFECTIVE IN PREDICTING THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT QUERIES THAT REPRESENT THE SAME INFORMATION NEED IT IS ALSO QUITE A KNOWN FACT IN THE IR COMMUNITY THAT DIFFERENT QUERIES THAT
utt_0042 utt 251.06 265.34 -X REPRESENT THE SAME INFORMATION NEED CAN EXHIBIT DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE SO BASED ON THIS WE DEFINE OUR FIRST GOAL IT IS TO DEFINE A FORMAL PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE QPP TASK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE INFORMATION
utt_0045 utt 265.34 278.22 -X INFORMATION NEED EXPLICITLY AND FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE QUERIES USED TO REPRESENT IT SO THE NEW PROBABILISTIC MODEL THAT WE SO WE REVISED THE PROBABILITY AND WE EXPLICITLY ADD THE INFORMATION NEED I
utt_0048 utt 278.90 289.47 -X HERE WE ADD A RANDOM VARIABLE I WHICH RECEIVES AS VALUES INFORMATION NEEDS AND WE CAN SEE IN THE RANDOM VARIABLES DEPENDENCIES GRAPH NOW THAT THE QUERY
utt_0050 utt 289.47 303.29 -X AND THE RELEVANCE EVENT ARE BOTH DEPENDENT IN THE INFORMATION NEED I SO FRAMING THE QPP TASK IN THIS WAY IS BASICALLY ASKING THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THIS RETRIEVED THIS RESULT LIST IS RELEVANT TO THIS
utt_0053 utt 303.29 318.01 -X INFORMATION NEED GIVEN THAT IT IS REPRESENTED BY THIS QUERY SO OUR SECOND GOAL IS A QPP USING REFERENCE QUERIES IT IS PREDICTING THE PERFORMANCE OF A GIVEN QUERY USING INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER QUERIES THAT CAN BE USED TO
utt_0056 utt 318.01 331.45 -X REPRESENT THE SAME INFORMATION NEED BASICALLY WE USE QUERY VARIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE SAME INFORMATION NEED IN ORDER AS A REFERENCE QUERIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE PREDICTION FOR THE QPP TASK NOW JUST AS A SIDE NOTE
utt_0059 utt 331.45 345.64 -X ABOUT QUERY VARIATIONS THEY CAN BE GENERATED BY HUMANS AS IT WAS DONE IN THE DATA SETS THAT WE HAVE USED IN OUR WORK OR THEY CAN BE GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY AS IT WAS DONE IN SEVERAL PAPERS AS YOU CAN SEE HERE USING A
utt_0062 utt 345.64 357.52 -X SEARCH SYSTEMS CLICK GRAPH SO JUST BEFORE DIVING INTO OUR MODEL I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION SOME RELATED WORK THAT HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON OUR MODEL SO
utt_0064 utt 357.52 370.62 -X THERE WERE A FEW WORKS THAT WERE ESTIMATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH A QUERY REPRESENTED AN INFORMATION NEED AND AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE WAS ONLY A SINGLE ONE THAT HAS DONE IT IN THE PURPOSES OF IMPROVING THE PREDICTION
utt_0067 utt 370.62 381.53 -X QUALITY IN QPP AND THERE WERE SEVERAL A FEW OF THEM THAT HAVE DONE IT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RETRIEVAL THERE WAS ALSO A WORK BY
utt_0069 utt 381.53 391.58 -X SHTOK ET AT THAT HAS SHOWN THAT WE CAN USE REFERENCE QUERIES, EXCUSE ME USING REFERENCE LISTS REFERENCE RESULT LISTS THAT WERE GENERATED BY DIFFERENT RETRIEVAL METHODS
utt_0071 utt 391.61 399.80 -X IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION QUALITY IN THE QPP TASK AND QUERY VARIATIONS WERE UTILIZED ALSO TO BOOST THE RETRIEVAL PERFORMANCE IN SEVERAL
utt_0073 utt 399.80 413.21 -X WORKS SO WHAT WE DO IS ACTUALLY USING QUERY VARIATIONS AS REFERENCE QUERIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTION QUALITY IN THE QPP TASK SO THIS IS OUR MODEL WE FIRST
utt_0075 utt 413.21 423.84 -X DEFINE QI AS THE SET OF THE REFERENCE QUERIES THE REFERENCE QUERIES ARE ALL THE QUERY VARIATIONS THAT CAN BE USED IN ORDER TO REPRESENT THE SAME
utt_0077 utt 423.84 435.63 -X INFORMATION NEED I AND HERE WE HAVE THE ESTIMATOR OF THE PROBABILITY OF A RELEVANCE EVENT USING REFERENCE QUERIES AND WE HAVE THE ESTIMATOR FOR THE
utt_0079 utt 435.63 440.93 -X PROBABILITY THAT A SPECIFIC REFERENCE QUERY WHICH WE WILL DENOTE WITH Q'
utt_0080 utt 442.20 444.57 -X IS CHOSEN AS A PROXY FOR THE INFORMATION NEED
utt_0081 utt 445.34 457.31 -X SO FIRST WE WILL DEFINE WE WILL CHOOSE HOW TO ESTIMATE THE PART THIS PART MARKED IN RED HERE SO WE CAN SEE IN THE RANDOM VARIABLES DEPENDENCIES GRAPH THAT
utt_0083 utt 457.31 472.29 -X THE QUERIES ARE DEPENDENT ONLY IN THE INFORMATION NEED I THEREFORE WE CAN OMIT ALL THE OTHER VARIABLES AND REMAIN ONLY WITH I AND INSPIRED BY THE RELEVANCE MODELS FRAMEWORK THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY LAVRENKO AND CROFT WE CHOSE TO ESTIMATE IT
utt_0086 utt 472.95 485.89 -X SIMPLY BASED ON THE GIVEN QUERY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PREDICT THE PERFORMANCE FOR AND THE PART MARKED IN BLUE THE ESTIMATOR OF THE PROBABILITY FOR A RELEVANCE EVENT GIVEN TWO QUERIES THAT REPRESENT THE SAME
utt_0089 utt 485.89 499.17 -X INFORMATION NEED I SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT IN SEVERAL WAYS FOR EXAMPLE AS WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IT WE CAN SEPARATE IT INTO DIFFERENT RETRIEVALS AND USE FUSION TO
utt_0091 utt 500.35 513.47 -X MERGE THE RESULTS INTO A SINGLE LIST AND INSPIRED BY THE FUSION METHODS WE HAVE SEPARATED IT INTO TWO SEPARATE QUERIES AND WE USE A SIMPLE LINEAR INTERPOLATION
utt_0093 utt 513.47 525.52 -X IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THIS ESTIMATOR AND NOW BY PLUGGING BACK IN BOTH OF THESE PARTS INTO THE ORIGINAL EXPRESSION WE RECEIVE OUR FINAL ESTIMATOR AS YOU CAN
utt_0095 utt 525.52 537.79 -X SEE IT UP HERE AND FROM THIS WE CAN NOW DERIVE SPECIFIC PREDICTORS SO WE CHOSE TO ESTIMATE FOR THE ESTIMATOR OF THE PROBABILITY OF RELEVANCE EVENT WE WILL
utt_0097 utt 537.79 548.69 -X USE AN EXISTING PREDICTOR YOU CAN SEE IT IN BLUE HERE AND AS FOR THE ESTIMATOR FOR THE PROBABILITY THAT A SPECIFIC REFERENCE QUERY IS CHOSEN BASED ON THE
utt_0099 utt 548.69 563.43 -X QUERY WE ARE TRYING TO PREDICT WE WILL USE AN INTER QUERY ASSOCIATION MEASURE MARKED IN RED HERE SO JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR A SPECIFIC PREDICTOR OF OUR METHOD FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN CHOOSE THAT AN EXISTING PREDICTOR WILL BE THE
utt_0102 utt 563.43 577.68 -X WIG PREDICTOR POST-RETRIEVAL PREDICTOR AND AS THE ASSOCIATION MEASURE WE WILL CHOOSE RBO WHICH STANDS FOR RANK BIASED OVERLAP AND THEN WE RECEIVE A SPECIFIC PREDICTOR WHICH WE WILL DENOTE WHICH WE WILL REFER
utt_0105 utt 577.68 590.08 -X TO IT IS REF-RBO SIMPLY BY PLUGGING IN THE WIG PREDICTOR AND THE RBO ASSOCIATION MEASURE SO IN OUR WORK WE HAVE USED TWO COLLECTIONS
utt_0107 utt 590.14 604.90 -X THE ROBUST AND THE CLUEWEB TWELVE CATEGORY B TREC COLLECTIONS WE WILL PRESENT RESULTS HERE ONLY WHEN USING THE AVGSCQ MAXIDF PRE-RETRIEVAL PREDICTORS AND THE WIG POST-RETRIEVAL PREDICTOR ON CLUEWEB
utt_0110 utt 604.90 616.07 -X TWELVE AND OUR METHOD WILL BE ONLY WITH THE ASSOCIATION MEASURE RBO IN OUR PAPER YOU CAN FIND MANY MORE RESULTS WE HAVE TESTED IT ON SEVERAL ON MANY
utt_0112 utt 616.07 626.40 -X PREDICTORS AND THE PREDICTION QUALITY PATTERNS WERE SIMILAR FOR ALL THE PREDICTORS THAT WE HAVE TESTED ON BOTH CORPORA WITH ALL THE ASSOCIATION
utt_0114 utt 626.40 636.20 -X MEASURES SO AS A RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS WE THE RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS HERE WILL BE MEASURED USING AVERAGE PRECISION AND THE PREDICTION QUALITY IS MEASURED BY
utt_0116 utt 636.20 650.52 -X PEARSON CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AP VALUES OF THE QUERIES AND THE PREDICTED VALUES WE HAVE USED TWO DATA SETS FOR THE QUERY VARIATIONS THE FIRST ONE IS
utt_0118 utt 650.52 661.41 -X THE TRACK CORE two thousand and seventeen FOR ROBUST AND THE SECOND ONE IS A UQVone hundred FOR THE CLUEWEB twelve AND IN THIS TABLE WE CAN SEE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SIMPLE
utt_0120 utt 661.41 672.87 -X STATISTICS SO FOR CLUE FOR EACH FOR EACH ONE OF THE HUNDRED ORIGINAL TOPICS THAT WE HAVE IN CLUEWEB twelve WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY forty-six QUERY VARIATIONS ON AVERAGE PER TOPIC
utt_0122 utt 673.47 679.88 -X WITH A STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALMOST nineteen AND HERE ON THE GRAPH ON THE LEFT SIDE
utt_0123 utt 683.27 697.73 -X THE THE Y-AXIS IS THE AP EFFECTIVENESS AND ALL THE BLUE PIXELS ARE THE AP SCORES OF ALL THE QUERY VARIATIONS PER TOPIC AND THE TOPICS ARE SIMPLY SORTED
utt_0125 utt 698.72 712.57 -X BY THE AP VALUE OF THEIR MEDIAN QUERY VARIATION ON THE X AXIS AND WE CAN SEE HERE THAT ON PER TOPIC BASIS THERE IS A HIGH VARIANCE OF RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS ACROSS QUERY VARIATIONS WE CAN ALSO
utt_0128 utt 712.57 718.71 -X SEE THE SMALL DOTS HERE ARE ACTUALLY THE TRACK THE ORIGINAL TRACK TITLE QUERIES
utt_0129 utt 719.75 728.81 -X THE IN ALL OF THE PRIOR WORK IN QPP AND RETRIEVAL THE QUERIES WERE SIMPLY THE TITLES OF THE TOPICS SO FROM NOW ON HERE
utt_0131 utt 729.03 739.72 -X I WILL REFER TO THEM AS THE TRACK TITLE QUERIES AND WE CAN SEE THAT THEY CAN BE MUCH HIGHER OR MUCH LOWER THAN THE MEDIAN OF THE TOPIC SO HERE WE SEE A
utt_0133 utt 739.72 748.81 -X COMPARISON OF PREDICTION QUALITY FOR EXISTING PREDICTORS AND WE HAVE THE AVGSCQ AND THE MAXIDF PREDICTORS THE VALUES ARE PEARSON
utt_0135 utt 748.81 759.78 -X CORRELATION AND WE CAN SEE THAT FOR THE EXISTING PREDICTORS THE PREDICTION QUALITY VARIES FOR QUERIES WITH DIFFERENT RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS MORE
utt_0137 utt 759.78 770.04 -X SPECIFICALLY WE SEE THAT AVGSCQ OUTPERFORMS THE MAXIDF PREDICTOR FOR THE TRACK TITLE QUERIES AND FOR THE QUERIES WITH THE MAXIMAL AP VALUES PER
utt_0139 utt 770.04 774.98 -X TOPIC BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE THAT THE MAXIDF OUTPERFORMS AVGSCQ
utt_0140 utt 775.01 786.90 -X FOR THE MEDIAN AP AND THE MINIMAL AP QUERIES SO THIS IS A COMPARISON TO OUR METHOD THE BASELINE HERE IS SIMPLY THE EXISTING PREDICTOR WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE
utt_0142 utt 786.90 790.82 -X QUERIES SO HERE WE COMPARE IT TO THE AVGSCQ PRE-RETRIEVAL PREDICTOR
utt_0143 utt 791.52 799.15 -X AND USING OUR METHOD AS REF-RBO WHICH IS SIMPLY OUR METHOD WITH THE RBO ASSOCIATION MEASURE AND AS THE EXISTING PREDICTOR WE ARE USING AVGSCQ
utt_0145 utt 799.40 813.32 -X AND WE SEE THAT THE METHOD OUTPERFORMS THE BASIC PREDICTOR IN ALL CASES REGARDLESS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE QUERY HERE THIS IS AGAIN A COMPARISON WITH THE WIG POST RETRIEVAL PREDICTOR AND AGAIN WE SEE THE SAME
utt_0148 utt 813.32 826.51 -X PATTERNS SO FURTHER EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT USING A SINGLE EVEN SINGLE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE QUERY VARIATIONS, QUERY VARIATION AS A REFERENCE QUERY IT CAN
utt_0150 utt 827.01 832.91 -X SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PREDICTION RESULTS AND MOREOVER THE
utt_0151 utt 834.82 839.31 -X HIGHER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REFERENCE QUERIES THE HIGHER THE
utt_0152 utt 839.37 851.40 -X QUALITY OF THE PREDICTION AND USING LOW REFERENCE QUERIES RESULTS IN DECREASED BOOST TO PREDICTION QUALITY WHICH MEANS THAT WE SIMPLY NEED ADD AS MUCH QUERIES
utt_0154 utt 851.40 865.07 -X AS WE CAN IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY IF WE HAVE REALLY LOW QUALITY REALLY LOW EFFECTIVENESS QUERIES AS REFERENCE QUERIES SO JUST TO SUM IT UP WE HAVE PROPOSED A NOVEL PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR QPP ONE THAT EXPLICITLY
utt_0157 utt 865.07 879.92 -X ACCOUNTS FOR THE INFORMATION NEED AND THE QUERIES USED TO REPRESENT IT AND WE HAVE SHOWN THE MERITS OF REPRESENTING THE INFORMATION NEED WITH MULTIPLE QUERIES FOR AT LEAST FOR THE QPP TASK AND IN OUR PAPER YOU CAN FIND MUCH MORE FURTHER
utt_0160 utt 879.92 890.25 -X ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS FACTORS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE PREDICTION QUALITY AND LAST IS THAT WE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECT OF QUERY EFFECTIVENESS ON THE PREDICTION QUALITY
utt_0162 utt 891.24 892.94 -X SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
utt_0163 utt 897.26 898.99 -X SO WE HAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS
utt_0164 utt 898.99 914.03 -X SO NO QUESTIONS THAT ONE QUESTION UP THERE
utt_0165 utt 921.93 935.69 -X THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT WORK COULD YOU GO BACK TO THE SLIDES WHERE YOU PRESENT THE GRAPH MODEL OF YOUR RANDOM VARIABLES BECAUSE YOU DID A GREAT WORK IN DEFINING
utt_0167 utt 936.11 950.29 -X THE RANDOM VARIABLES YES HERE AND THEN WHEN YOU DEVELOP THE MODEL HAVE SOME TROUBLES BECAUSE YOU ADD A RANDOM VARIABLE Q FIRST OR Q PRIME WHICH IS I THINK THE OLDER VARIANTS OF THE QUEUE NOT HERE IN THE FOLLOWING SLIDES AND
utt_0170 utt 950.31 964.45 -X THEN I WOULD SUGGEST TO ADD THAT RANDOM VARIABLE SO WHENEVER YOU CREATE THE NEW QUERIES I WOULD ADD A RANDOM VARIABLE IN THIS GRAPH AND THEN THERE IS ANOTHER STEP THAT I WOULD SUGGEST TO CORRECT BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE ALL THIS WORK IN
utt_0173 utt 964.45 973.02 -X DEFINING A MODEL COULD YOU GO A COUPLE OF SLIDES AFTER THIS SORRY FORWARD YES
utt_0174 utt 973.83 988.56 -X HERE WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU MAKE A NEW LINEAR INTERPOLATION WITH LAMBDA YOU'RE ACTUALLY INTRODUCING BERNOULLI RANDOM VARIABLE WITH PARAMETER LAMBDA SO AGAIN THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF STEPS YOU I WOULD SUGGEST TO IMPROVE BECAUSE YOU
utt_0177 utt 988.56 993.97 -X HAVE DONE ALL THIS WORK AND THEN THERE ARE SOME STEPS FOR EXAMPLE Q PRIME WHY
utt_0178 utt 993.97 1004.18 -X HAVEN'T YOU ADDED Q PRIME SOMEWHERE IN THE IN THE GRAPH WELL HERE WE USE A
utt_0179 utt 1004.18 1009.12 -X CAPITAL LETTERS AS RANDOM VARIABLES AND THE LOWERCASE LETTERS ARE THE VALUES
utt_0180 utt 1009.55 1018.10 -X SIMPLY FOR BREVITY WE OWE ME TWO RANDOM VARIABLES EXCEPT FOR THE RELEVANCE EVENT SO THE RANDOM VARIABLE Q RECEIVES AS A VALUE EITHER Q OR A Q PRIME
utt_0183 utt 1021.04 1032.42 -X PROBABILITY YOU HAVE Q AND Q PRIME SO I ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE TWO RANDOM VARIABLES ONE Q AND Q PRIME BUT ANYWAY I GREW I CAN CATCH YOU UP LATER IT'S VERY
utt_0185 utt 1032.49 1046.35 -X INTERESTING THANK YOU THANK YOU SO THAT'S TIME TO SPEAK AGAIN SO THE FINAL PAPER OF THE SESSION IS ENTITLED THE CHARACTERISTIC OF BOY SEARCH COMPARING SPOKEN WITH TYPE IT IN MOBILE
utt_0188 utt 1046.35 1051.18 -5.2139 WEB SEARCH QUERIES AND WILL BE GIVEN BY EDO GUY
