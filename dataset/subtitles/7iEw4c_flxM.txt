utt_0003 utt 43.28 56.27 -X MULTIMODAL AND MULTIVIEW DISTILLATION FOR REAL TIME PLAYER DETECTION ON A FOOTBALL FIELD THAT'S OUR two thousand and twenty CVSPORTS PAPER AND WE ARE VERY GLAD TO PRESENT IT TO YOU SAFELY IN THIS NEW FORMAT LET'S IMAGINE
utt_0006 utt 56.27 68.63 -X THAT YOU'VE BUILT A FOOTBALL FIELD IN YOUR TOWN AS A VERY POPULAR SPORT IT IS OFTEN USED BY KIDS TEAMS AND OTHER FOOTBALL AMATEURS THEREFORE YOU WOULD LIKE TO MONITOR THE OCCUPANCY OF YOUR SOCCER FIELD TO PROVE THAT IT WAS A
utt_0009 utt 68.63 73.33 -X GOOD INVESTMENT AND THAT OTHER TOWNS SHOULD DO IT AS WELL HOW WOULD YOU DO
utt_0011 utt 78.16 88.98 -X LARGE THEREFORE SEVERAL REGULAR CAMERAS MUST BE USED TO COVER THE WHOLE FIELD WHICH MAKES THE SETUP COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE A SINGLE
utt_0014 utt 94.08 105.36 -X THE PLAYERS AND MAKES AN AUTOMATIC MONITORING DIFFICULT ANOTHER DIFFICULTY COMES FROM DIFFERENT WEATHER CONDITIONS POOR LIGHTING RAIN SHADOWS MIST ALL
utt_0016 utt 105.36 118.44 -X THESE ELEMENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE ABILITY OF STANDARD ALGORITHMS TO DETECT THE PLAYERS ON THE FIELD BUT DON'T WORRY THEY CAN BE HANDLED ALL AT ONCE WITH THE HELP OF A SINGLE DEVICE A
utt_0019 utt 118.44 126.26 -X THERMAL CAMERA SINCE THE HUMAN BODY GENERALLY HAS A HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN THE BACKGROUND IT MAKES THE PLAYER DETECTION AN EASY TASK
utt_0021 utt 126.67 131.80 -X HOWEVER THESE CAMERAS ARE EXPENSIVE AND THEY HAVE A VERY NARROW FIELD OF VIEW
utt_0022 utt 132.69 147.00 -X OKAY SO IF I SUM THIS UP WE WANT TO DETECT ALL THE PLAYERS ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD WE CAN HAVE A CHEAP FISHEYE CAMERA THAT SEES IT ALL BUT WITH A DEBATABLE QUALITY AND WE CAN HAVE A THERMAL CAMERA THAT MAKES THE DETECTION TASK SUPER EASY
utt_0025 utt 147.00 157.65 -X ON A PORTION OF THE FIELD WELL THEN I THINK WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN THIS WORK WE WILL DETECT THE PLAYERS
utt_0027 utt 157.65 172.60 -X ON THE THERMAL CAMERA TRANSFER DETECTIONS ON THE FISHEYE IMAGE PERFORM SOME CUSTOM DATA AUGMENTATION TO GENERATE FAKE DETECTIONS EVERYWHERE IN THE FISHEYE IMAGE AND TRAIN A NETWORK ON THE FISHEYE IMAGE SO THAT AT
utt_0030 utt 172.60 185.62 -X INFERENCE TIME WE HAVE THE OCCUPANCY MONITORING AND THAT IS GREAT LET'S GET STARTED SO FIRST WE NEED TO CAPTURE SOME DATA FOR THAT WE HAVE OUR COLLEAGUE BACK THERE IN DENMARK HEY HUDA COULD YOU PLEASE TELL US MORE ABOUT THE
utt_0033 utt 185.62 196.73 -X SETUP THAT YOU'VE INSTALLED HI GUYS OF COURSE SO WE HAVE INSTALLED TWO CAMERAS IN ONE OF AALBORG'S AMATEUR FOOTBALL FIELD SO ONE IS FISHEYE THAT HAS A VERY WIDE
utt_0035 utt 196.73 201.05 -X ANGLE AND THE OTHER ONE IS THE THERMAL THAT ALLOWS TO SEE PLAYERS VERY CLEARLY
utt_0037 utt 204.66 209.24 -X SO IN THIS SETUP THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE THERMAL CAMERA REPRESENTS six% OF THE
utt_0038 utt 209.68 215.13 -X FISHEYE IMAGE AND IT COVERS twenty-two% OF THE FOOTBALL FIELD AS SEEN BY THE FISHEYE
utt_0039 utt 215.54 220.57 -X CAMERA AND THEN WE HAVE TO DO SOME REGISTRATION BETWEEN TWO CAMERAS SO THAT
utt_0043 utt 234.65 244.38 -X THE ENTIRE FIELD YES THANK YOU WOW THANKS HUDA BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER LET'S GO BACK EXACTLY ONE YEAR IN TIME AT THE PREVIOUS CVSPORTS WORKSHOP
utt_0045 utt 249.65 260.22 -X AAAH THE WONDERFULL YEAR OF two thousand and nineteen WHEN WE WEREN'T AFRAID OF GATHERING IN FULL ROOMS AND MAKING OUR WAY IN THE CROWDED ALLEYS OF THE POSTER SESSIONS IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT
utt_0047 utt 260.31 266.38 -X THAT WE PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THE CONCEPT OF ONLINE DISTILLATION
utt_0048 utt 266.93 280.03 -X THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO PRODUCE REAL-TIME NETWORKS THAT KEEP ON LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE MATCH AND IMPROVE ON THE TASK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PERFORM THE FIRST IMPORTANT COMPONENT IS A STUDENT NETWORK THAT IS FAST ENOUGH TO WORK IN
utt_0051 utt 280.03 293.95 -X REAL TIME AND IT'S WEIGHTS WILL BE REGULARLY UPDATED TO ADAPT TO THE LATEST VIDEO CONDITIONS THIS WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD GENERALIZATION ON THE CURRENT VIDEO IN ORDER TO TRAIN THE STUDENT DURING THE
utt_0054 utt 293.95 305.34 -X VIDEO WE NEED A SECOND PROCESS THAT RUNS IN PARALLEL A MASSIVE TEACHER NETWORK PRODUCES SOME SURROGATE GROUND TRUTH AT A MUCH LOWER SPEED BUT WITH A VERY HIGH
utt_0056 utt 305.34 316.12 -X QUALITY THESE GROUND TRUTHS ARE THEN STORED IN AN ONLINE DATA SET TO BE USED TO TRAIN A COPY OF THE STUDENT NETWORK AT EACH EPOCH THE WEIGHTS OF THE STUDENT
utt_0058 utt 316.12 326.53 -X ARE UPDATED AND IT THUS GETS BETTER AND BETTER AND CAN EVEN SURPASS THE TEACHER AS IT IS MADE SPECIFIC TO THE VIDEO AAAH GOOD OLD TIMES
utt_0060 utt 327.32 337.89 -X OK LET'S NOW PREPARE OUR DATA TO USE THE ONLINE DISTILLATION APPROACH IN OUR PARTICULAR CONTEXT AS A TEACHER NETWORK WE REUSE A YOLO NETWORK OBTAINED IN A
utt_0062 utt 337.89 348.80 -X PREVIOUS WORK THAT DETECTS PLAYERS ON THE THERMAL CAMERA USING THE CAMERA CALIBRATION WE TRANSFER THE PLAYER BOUNDING BOXES TO THE FISHEYE IMAGES BY
utt_0064 utt 348.80 359.68 -X DOING SO WE OBTAIN SOME SURROGATE GROUND-TRUTH ANNOTATIONS THAT WE CAN USE TO TRAIN A STUDENT YOLO-TINY NETWORK ON THE FISHEYE IMAGES IS THAT ALL
utt_0066 utt 360.15 365.31 -X UNFORTUNATELY NO IF WE TRAIN OUR NETWORK THIS WAY IT WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO DETECT
utt_0069 utt 374.93 386.24 -X ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DETECT THESE PLAYERS THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE LITERALLY CONTROL-C CONTROL-V NO DOUBT THAT YOU'VE RECOGNIZED THIS LIFE-SAVING SHORTCUT
utt_0071 utt 386.24 399.49 -X THAT WILL BE OUR BEST FRIEND HERE SINCE WE KNOW FROM THE TEACHER NETWORK WHERE THE PLAYERS ARE WE CAN EXTRACT THEM AND THEN COPY/PASTE THEM OUTSIDE OF THAT REGION OF COURSE WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DISTORTION OF THE FISHEYE
utt_0074 utt 399.49 411.22 -X LENS AND WE'LL HAVE TO SCALE ROTATE AND MAYBE BLEND THE NEW PLAYERS SO THAT THE OVERALL IMAGE LOOKS REALISTIC HENCE WE WILL HAVE NEW PLAYERS WITH KNOWN BOUNDING
utt_0076 utt 411.22 422.80 -X BOXES AWESOME BUT WAIT A MINUTE DON'T GET EXCITED TOO SOON IF WE TRAIN OUR NETWORK WITH THESE NEW FAKE PLAYERS AND ANNOTATIONS WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE
utt_0078 utt 422.80 433.47 -X REMAINING REAL PLAYERS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ERASED WELL FOR NOW OUR STUDENT WILL BE FORCED TO DETECT THE ARTIFICIAL PLAYERS BUT WILL BE PENALIZED
utt_0080 utt 433.47 444.69 -X FOR DETECTING THE REAL ONES IT WILL SIMPLY GO MAD TO OVERCOME THIS ISSUE WE WILL USE SOMETHING AS OLD AS TIME A BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION ALGORITHM WELL TO BE
utt_0082 utt 444.69 455.31 -X FAIR THE ONE THAT WE USE IS STILL A BIT FRESH IT WAS DEVELOPED IN two thousand and nine AND IS CALLED VIBE THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF VIBE IS THAT IT IS VERY SENSITIVE TO MOTION
utt_0084 utt 455.36 470.34 -X SO YOU'RE SURE THAT ALL THE PLAYERS WILL BE IN THE MOTION MASK THE DRAWBACK IS THAT IT AS QUITE SOME FALSE POSITIVES BUT ONE THING IS FOR SURE IS THAT ALL YOUR PLAYERS WILL BE SEGMENTED AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED WE CAN COMPUTE THE
utt_0087 utt 470.34 481.43 -X MOTION MASKS FOR ALL THE FRAMES AND DILATE THEM TO BE SURE THAT WE COMPLETELY ENCLOSE ALL THE PLAYERS WHERE THERE IS MOTION WE CANNOT BE SURE
utt_0089 utt 481.43 492.32 -X WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A PLAYER SO WE SIMPLY ZERO OUT THE LOSS OF THE STUDENT DURING TRAINING THIS RELAXES THE TRAINING AND ENSURES THAT WE DO NOT FORCE
utt_0091 utt 492.32 505.70 -X AVOIDING DETECTIONS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE PLAYERS ON THE COUNTERPART WHERE THERE IS NO MOTION AND WHERE WE DID NOT ADD ARTIFICIAL PLAYERS WE ARE SURE THAT
utt_0093 utt 505.70 518.02 -X THERE ARE NO PLAYERS TO DETECT AND SO WE FORCE THE NETWORK TO AVOID PREDICTING ANYTHING THERE AWESOME NOW LET'S SEE HOW IT PERFORMS ON A REAL VIDEO WHAT YOU'RE
utt_0095 utt 518.02 528.13 -X ABOUT TO SEE IS THE EVOLUTION OF THE PERFORMANCE IN DETECTION THROUGHOUT THE VIDEO THE NETWORK STARTS FROM SCRATCH SO WITH NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL OF WHAT IT IS
utt_0097 utt 528.13 537.40 -X SEEING OR SUPPOSED TO DETECT STEP-BY-STEP IT WILL LEARN TO DETECT THE PLAYERS NOT ONLY IN THE COMMON REGION BUT ALSO OUTSIDE THE COMMON REGION
utt_0100 utt 542.82 553.06 -X THE PAPER WHERE WE LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF EACH COMPONENT SEPARATELY AS A SHORT SUMMARY YOU SHOULD RETAIN THAT EACH ELEMENT IS IMPORTANT IF WE REMOVE THE
utt_0102 utt 553.06 566.02 -X DATA AUGMENTATION PART THE NETWORK IS UNABLE TO MAKE ANY PREDICTION OUTSIDE THE COMMON REGION IF WE CANCEL THE LOSS EVERYWHERE OUTSIDE THE COMMON REGION THE NETWORK MAKES THOUSANDS OF FALSE
utt_0106 utt 571.65 576.14 -X OUR NETWORK IS STILL ABLE TO DETECT THEM EVEN IF THE ONLY GROUND TRUTH THAT WAS
utt_0108 utt 581.32 586.58 -X AND IT SHOWS HOW POWERFUL ONLINE DISTILLATION CAN BE IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS
utt_0109 utt 586.82 601.61 -X SO COOL OK LET'S RECAP WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS VIDEO WE WERE INTERESTED IN AUTOMATICALLY MONITORING A FOOTBALL FIELD OCCUPANCY WE COMBINED TWO MODALITIES WITH DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE FIELD ONE FROM THE FISHEYE CAMERA AND
utt_0112 utt 601.61 612.11 -X ONE FROM A THERMAL CAMERA WE USE THE PLAYER DETECTOR AVAILABLE FOR THE THERMAL CAMERA TO OBTAIN BY PROJECTION SURROGATE ANNOTATIONS ON A PORTION OF
utt_0114 utt 612.11 626.19 -X THE FISHEYE CAMERA FROM THIS AREA WE CROPPED AND COPY PASTED THE PLAYERS AND THEIR BOUNDING BOXES INTO THE REMAINING PART OF THE IMAGE TO CREATE ARTIFICIAL PLAYERS WITH KNOWN GROUND TRUTH TO AVOID MISLEADING THE NETWORK WITH THE
utt_0117 utt 626.19 640.49 -X REMAINING NON-ERASED PLAYERS WE USE A BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION ALGORITHM SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE IMAGE THAT ARE IN MOTION ARE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE TRAINING PROCESS OUR STUDENT IS CONSTANTLY ADAPTED TO THE LATEST MATCH
utt_0120 utt 640.49 647.51 -X CONDITION AND WEATHER CONDITION WITH AN ONLINE DISTILLATION STRATEGY FINALLY WE
utt_0122 utt 653.26 660.24 -X WATCHING WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED THIS PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT AND SEE YOU NEXT TIME BYE
