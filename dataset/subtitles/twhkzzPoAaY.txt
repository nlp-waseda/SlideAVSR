utt_0000 utt 0.29 2.03 -X HELLO EVERYONE, I'M ANINDYA MONDAL
utt_0001 utt 2.41 4.91 -X AND I HAVE BEEN AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT
utt_0002 utt 4.94 6.93 -X IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRONICS AND
utt_0003 utt 7.44 21.33 -X TELECOMMUNICATION ENGINEERING AT JADAVPUR UNIVERSITY INDIA TODAY I'M GOING TO PRESENT MY WORK RECOVERY OF MISSING SENSOR DATA BY RECONSTRUCTING TIME-VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS AT THE EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE
utt_0010 utt 21.33 25.84 -X HELD AT BELGRADE SERBIA WE ORGANIZE OUR PRESENTATION AS FOLLOWS
utt_0013 utt 29.00 35.09 -X IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE FOUND A WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS IN VARIOUS DOMAINS.
utt_0016 utt 35.44 39.35 -X PRIMARY REASONS FOR THEIR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION INCLUDE THEIR LOW COST
utt_0018 utt 40.53 42.71 -X LOW POWER REQUIREMENT AND EASE OF DEPLOYMENT
utt_0019 utt 43.25 47.22 -X OFTEN THESE SENSORS ARE DEPLOYED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS
utt_0021 utt 47.92 52.50 -X AND SOME OF THESE NODES CAN GET DAMAGED DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL OR HUMAN INTERVENTION
utt_0024 utt 54.00 57.07 -X AND HENCE REPLACING THESE DEFECTED SENSORS
utt_0026 utt 57.68 58.90 -X BECOME A TEDIOUS TASK
utt_0027 utt 60.30 69.78 -X SO ACCURATELY RECONSTRUCTING THESE UNAVAILABLE VALUES IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM OF
utt_0032 utt 70.06 76.27 -X RECONSTRUCTING THE MISSING DATA. SOME OF THEM ARE BASED ON THE K NEAREST NEIGHBORHOOD EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION
utt_0035 utt 76.97 88.05 -X LOW RANK MATRIX COMPLETION AND PROBABILISTIC MATRIX FACTORIZATION HOWEVER MOST OF THESE METHODS GIVE SUB-OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE WHEN A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF DATA IS UNAVAILABLE
utt_0040 utt 89.52 95.92 -X THE REASONS MAY BE THAT THEY FAIL TO PROPERLY UTILIZE THE EMBEDDED SPATIO TEMPORAL DEPENDENCIES IN THE SENSOR DATA
utt_0043 utt 97.07 98.90 -X OUR METHOD IMPROVES UPON THIS
utt_0044 utt 99.44 101.94 -X PREVIOUS METHODS UP TO A GREAT EXTENT
utt_0045 utt 105.04 118.10 -X SO BEFORE MOVING ON INTO OUR WORK LET US DISCUSS IN THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR PAPER SO IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN AND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF GRAPH-BASED METHODS IN VARIOUS DOMAINS LIKE COMPUTER VISION BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL NETWORKS
utt_0052 utt 118.35 120.80 -X INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREDICTION AND MANY OTHERS
utt_0054 utt 121.39 130.68 -X THE PRIMARY REASON BEHIND THEIR WIDESPREAD APPLICATION ARE THE ABILITY OF GRAPHS TO CAPTURE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION FROM DATA RELYING ON IRREGULAR AND COMPLEX STRUCTURES
utt_0059 utt 131.73 135.32 -X GRAPH SIGNAL PROCESSING IS ONE SUCH GRAPH BASED TECHNIQUE.
utt_0061 utt 136.08 150.26 -X SAMPLING AND RECONSTRUCTION OF GRAPH SIGNALS IN GSP PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN VARIOUS REAL-LIFE APPLICATIONS IN OUR WORK THE GRAPH VERTICES REPRESENTS THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE SENSOR NODES AND THE VERTEX INDEX SIGNALS REPRESENT THE SENSOR ATTRIBUTES
utt_0069 utt 151.82 153.52 -X TO SUMMARIZE OUR CONTRIBUTIONS
utt_0070 utt 153.74 159.89 -X WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF RECONSTRUCTING TIME VARYING DROP SIGNALS TO RECOVER MISSING DATA IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
utt_0074 utt 160.18 162.90 -X OUR WORK IS INSPIRED BY THE two thousand and twenty MACHINE
utt_0075 utt 163.12 173.94 -X LEARNING AND SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP PAPER BY GIRALDO AND OTHERS IN THAT PAPER THEY PREDICT THE NUMBER OF NEW COVnineteen CASES BY EXTENDING THE SAMPLES FROM DEFINED AND DROP SIGNAL PROCESSING
utt_0080 utt 174.03 175.73 -X FOR TIME CUTTING GRAPH SIGNALS
utt_0081 utt 176.75 180.05 -X HERE WE UTILIZE THE SAMPLE OF METHOD FOR THE RECOVERY PURPOSE
utt_0083 utt 181.04 184.85 -X THIS METHOD SHOWS SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OVER STATE OF
utt_0085 utt 186.26 193.53 -X THE ART AND WE VALIDATE OUR CLAIM BY PERFORMING EXPERIMENTS ON MULTIPLE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SETS WHICH ARE COLLECTED FROM DIVERSE IN ENVIRONMENTS,
utt_0090 utt 193.81 196.21 -X BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS
utt_0091 utt 198.55 200.50 -X THIS IS THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
utt_0092 utt 201.49 205.17 -X BEFORE DISCUSSING ALGORITHM LET US DISCUSS SOME BASICS OF GRAPH THEORY
utt_0094 utt 205.49 217.91 -X SO WE HAVE A GRAPH WHICH IS BASICALLY WE HAVE NU AS THE SET OF VETICES AND EPSILON IS THE SET OF EDGES AND W AS THE WEIGHTED ADJACENCY MATRIX THE WEIGHTED ADJACENCY MATRIX EXPLAINS THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE NODES IN THE GRAPH
utt_0101 utt 217.91 227.89 -X D IS THE DEGREE MATRIX WHICH IS A DIAGONAL MATRIX AND L IS AN ARE NORMALIZED LAPLACIAN OF G WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE OF THE DEGREE MATRIX AND THE WEIGHTED ADJACENCY MATRIX
utt_0106 utt 228.40 232.31 -X ALSO WE HAVE X WHICH IS A REAL VALUED VERTEX INDEX GRAPH SIGNAL
utt_0108 utt 232.88 235.51 -X AND THE IT IS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE BELOW
utt_0109 utt 237.84 242.10 -X AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER SAMPLING AND CONSTRUCTION OF GRAPH SIGNALS IS AN USEFUL PROPERTY
utt_0112 utt 242.19 244.18 -X OF GRAPH SIGNAL PROCESSING
utt_0114 utt 247.28 250.42 -X AND IT HELPS APPLYING GSP IN VARIOUS REAL-LIFE DOMAINS
utt_0117 utt 251.19 259.10 -X HERE WE CAN SEE THETA IS A SAMPLING OPERATOR. SO WHAT THETA DOES IS THAT IT PERFORMS THE SAMPLING OF SOME OF THE NODES OF THE GRAPH
utt_0121 utt 259.32 268.63 -X AFTER THAT WE CAN SEE PHI AS THE INTERPOLATION OPERATOR WHICH FINDS OUT OR INTERPOLATES OR RECONSTRUCTS THE UNAVAILABLE VALUES FROM THE AVAILABLE VALUES WE HAVE
utt_0126 utt 270.93 283.86 -X SO IN OUR WORK WE MODEL THE MISSING SENSOR DATA RECOVERY PROBLEM AS THE RECONSTRUCTION OF TIME-VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS WE PERFORM THE RECONSTRUCTION BY MINIMIZING THE SOBOLEV NORM OF TIME VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS SO IN THE WORK
utt_0134 utt 285.72 288.95 -X WE HAVE A SENSOR NETWORK WITH MANY SENSOR NODES
utt_0136 utt 289.33 289.94 -X AND
utt_0137 utt 290.55 304.44 -X EACH SENSOR RECORDS A CERTAIN ATTRIBUTE LET'S SAY THE TEMPERATURE OF A SPECIFIC GEOGRPHICAL REGION OVER THE SPAN OF AN YEAR SO IT MAY HAPPEN THAT SOME OF THE SENSORS MAY BE DEFECTED OR AND OR DAMAGED FOR WHICH
utt_0143 utt 304.44 312.34 -X SOME OF THE VALUES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY SENSOR FOR ANY SPECIFIC TIME SO USING THIS ALGORITHM ALGORITHM WE ARE TRYING TO
utt_0147 utt 313.20 315.45 -X RECONSTRUCT THOSE UNAVAILABLE VALUES
utt_0148 utt 316.28 330.14 -X IN OUR WORK WE HAVE MADE SOME PRIOR ASSUMPTIONS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ASSUME THAT THE GRAPH SIGNALS ARE SMOOTH IN SPACE AND TIME THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE NEARBY SENSORS HAVE SIMILAR READINGS AND CHANGES IN READINGS
utt_0154 utt 330.14 331.39 -X ARE NOT ABRUPT WITH TIME
utt_0155 utt 334.49 337.91 -X NOW WE MOVE INTO OUR WORK SO BASICALLY X IS A MATRIX
utt_0157 utt 338.87 344.19 -X OF TIME-VARYING GRAPH SIGNAL, WHERE EACH ELEMENT XT DENOTES THE SIGNAL VALUE AT TIME T
utt_0160 utt 344.60 359.07 -X HERE EACH ROW OF X REPRESENTS A TIME SERIES ON THE CORRESPONDING VERTICES IN two thousand and seventeen QIU AND OTHERS DEFINED THE SMOOTHNESS FUNCTION StwoX WHICH IS THE TRACE OF THE PRODUCT OF THE TRANSPOSE OF MATRIX X, THE LAPLACIAN
utt_0166 utt 359.07 366.33 -X AND THE MATRIX X ITSELF THE EXPRESSION HERE COMES FROM THE SUM OF ALL THE LAPLACIAN QUADRATIC FORM OF EACH GRAPH SIGNAL
utt_0170 utt 368.47 372.63 -X QIU AND OTHERS ALSO DEFINED A TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE OPERATOR DH AS
utt_0172 utt 373.40 374.36 -X SHOWN HERE
utt_0173 utt 374.84 376.52 -X THE TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE OPERATOR
utt_0174 utt 377.72 382.17 -X WHEN MULTIPLIED WITH THE MATRIX X GIVES THE TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE GRAPH SIGNAL
utt_0176 utt 382.42 386.06 -X SO THIS IS BASICALLY THE ARRAY OR THE MATRIX OF THE
utt_0178 utt 386.23 393.05 -X DIFFERENCE OF THE VALUES OF THE GRAPH SIGNALS BETWEEN EACH CONSECUTIVE TIME, FOR EXAMPLE HERE YOU CAN SEE IT IS Xtwo MINUS Xone, Xthree
utt_0182 utt 393.21 394.08 -X MINUS Xtwo
utt_0183 utt 394.49 399.69 -X SO BASICALLY EACH ELEMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF THE NEIGHBORING OR NEARBY
utt_0186 utt 400.06 406.48 -X GRAPH SIGNALS OR SENSOR READINGS IN OUR WORK THEY ALSO DEFINE OUR MATRIX J
utt_0189 utt 406.87 408.60 -X WHICH IS THE SAMPLING MATRIX
utt_0190 utt 410.39 416.99 -X IN two thousand and twenty, GIRALDO AND OTHERS DEFINED THE SOBOLEV NORM FOR TIME VARYING SIGNALS WHICH IS BASICALLY A TRACE MATRIX AS SHOWN HERE
utt_0194 utt 417.18 423.87 -X IT COMES FROM THE SUM OF ALL THE SOBOLEV NORM FOR EACH GRAPH SIGNAL AND L IS A SYMMETRIC MATRIX
utt_0197 utt 424.60 429.42 -X FINALLY WE FORMULATE THE SOBOLEV RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEM FOR TIME VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS
utt_0200 utt 429.72 435.10 -X BASED ON THE WORK OF GIRALDO AND OTHERS AS SHOWN HERE IT BASICALLY CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS
utt_0203 utt 437.75 449.18 -X THE FIRST PART HERE THAT IS THIS ONE WHICH IS BASICALLY ERROR TERM AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE SOBOLEV NORM TERM THE FIRST TERM WHICH IS BASICALLY THE MINIMIZATION FUNCTION BASICALLY IF IT RECONSTRUCTS
utt_0209 utt 449.88 454.01 -X THE ORIGINAL VALUES OF THE UNAVAILABLE VALUES OF THE SENSOR READINGS
utt_0211 utt 454.59 458.72 -X AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE USING THE AVAILABLE VALUES WE HAVE
utt_0213 utt 459.03 463.81 -X THE SECOND ONE INCORPORATES THE TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE OPERATOR SO BASICALLY
utt_0216 utt 464.79 470.08 -X THE TEMPORAL DIFFERENCE OPERATOR HELPS TO INCORPORATE THE SPATIAL AS WELL AS THE TEMPORAL INFORMATION
utt_0219 utt 470.62 474.69 -X SO BASED ON THESE TWO FUNCTIONS TWO TERMS AS SHOWN HERE
utt_0221 utt 476.25 480.57 -X WE FINALLY FORMULATED THE SOBOLEV RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM FOR TIME-VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS
utt_0224 utt 482.87 486.91 -X WHICH HELPS TO RECONSTRUCT THOSE UNAVAILABLE VALUES WITH THE ONES WE HAVE WITH US
utt_0226 utt 489.82 494.72 -X HELLO MY NAME IS MAYUKHMALI DAS AND I WILL BE PRESENTING THE REMAINING OF THE SLIDES
utt_0228 utt 495.48 499.84 -X WE HAVE EVALUATED OUR PROPOSED METHODS ON THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SETS LIKE
utt_0230 utt 499.96 502.56 -X MOLENE DATA SET AND INTEL LAB DATA SET
utt_0231 utt 502.71 516.80 -X THE MOLENE IS AN OPEN ACCESS DATA SET OF HOURLY WEATHER OBSERVATION IN BRITTANY FRANCE WHILE THE INTEL LAB DATA SET CONSISTS OF THE DATA COLLECTED FROM fifty-four SENSORS DEPLOYED IN THE INTEL BERKELEY RESEARCH LABORATORY
utt_0237 utt 517.27 524.80 -X WE HAVE COMPARED OUR PROPOSED METHOD AGAINST STATE OF THE ART DATA RECOVERY APPROACHES LIKE KNN EM LMRC AND PMF
utt_0240 utt 525.63 540.19 -X IN OUR WORK WE REMOVED RANDOM DATA POINTS FROM EACH OF THE DATA SETS AND THEN USING OUR FRAMEWORK WE TRIED RECONSTRUCTING THOSE MISSING VALUES THE VALUES THAT GENERATED WERE COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING ORIGINAL VALUES USING
utt_0246 utt 540.19 542.46 -X MATRIX LIKE MAE AND RMSE
utt_0247 utt 544.70 550.82 -X HERE WE SHOW THE QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF THE STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS VERSUS THE PROPOSED METHODS
utt_0250 utt 551.13 553.18 -X THE BEST RESULTS ARE IN BOLD
utt_0251 utt 554.11 562.21 -X HERE BY SAMPLING DENSITY WE MEAN THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE SAMPLING DENSITY OF zero point one MEANS
utt_0254 utt 562.62 569.82 -X THAT WE HAVE ONLY ten PERCENT OF THE DATA AVAILABLE AND WE NEED TO RECONSTRUCT THE REMAINING ninety PERCENT OF THE DATA
utt_0257 utt 576.57 583.81 -X HERE WE SHOW THE RMSE AND MAE PLOTS IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT EVEN UNDER LOWER SAMPLING DENSITY THE PROPOSED METHOD
utt_0260 utt 583.90 585.98 -X DELIVERS CONSISTENTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE
utt_0261 utt 590.49 599.91 -X FINALLY TO SUMMARIZE THE WHOLE WORK WE APPLY THE CONCEPT OF TIME VARYING GRAPH SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION TO RECOVER MISSING DATA IN SENSOR NETWORKS
utt_0265 utt 600.48 608.74 -X IT LEVERAGES THE CONCEPT OF A RECENTLY INTRODUCED METHOD BASED ON MINIMIZATION OF THE SOBOLE NORM OF TIME VARYING GRAPH SIGNALS
utt_0269 utt 609.02 618.69 -X THIS METHOD SURPASSES MULTIPLE PREVIOUS APPROACHES IN THE RECONSTRUCTION ACCURACY ESPECIALLY DURING THE UNAVAILABILITY OF A BIG CHUNK OF DATA
utt_0273 utt 618.97 623.55 -X IN FUTURE WE CAN EXTEND THE METHOD TO INCLUDE NON-SMOOTH SITUATIONS
utt_0275 utt 624.13 631.52 -X HERE WE MEAN SITUATIONS WHERE NEARBY LOCALITIES HAVE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE OR CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE ARE ABRUPT WITH TIME
utt_0279 utt 632.32 635.91 -X WE CAN APPLY GRAPH LEARNING BASED METHODS TO ATTAIN THIS CODE
utt_0281 utt 637.50 643.71 -X THANK YOU FOR LISTENING LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR WORK YOU
