utt_0000 utt 1.32 7.47 -X HI, THIS IS HYEONJUN AND JIHYONG FROM THE KOREA ADVANCED INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,
utt_0001 utt 7.47 12.37 -X THE FIRST AUTHORS OF “XVFI: EXTREME VIDEO FRAME INTERPOLATION”.
utt_0002 utt 12.37 16.53 -X WE’VE EQUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS WORK, ADVISED BY PROF. MUNCHURL KIM.
utt_0003 utt 16.81 23.34 -X I’LL BE NARRATING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS VIDEO, AND JIHYONG WILL NARRATE THE SECOND HALF.
utt_0004 utt 23.34 31.70 -X RECENT DEEP LEARNING-BASED VIDEO FRAME INTERPOLATION NETWORKS ARE OFTEN OPTIMIZED FOR EXISTING LOW-RESOLUTION AND LOW-FRAME-RATE DATASETS.
utt_0005 utt 31.79 38.64 -X THE LR-LFR DATASETS MAY LEAD TO POOR VFI PERFORMANCE FOR fourK OR HIGHER RESOLUTION VIDEO WITH LARGE MOTION.
utt_0006 utt 40.24 47.92 -X THUS, WE PROPOSE A NEW DATASET OF fourK one thousandFPS VIDEOS WITH AN EXTREME MOTION TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY.
utt_0007 utt 48.43 51.76 -X THE BELOW FIGURES SHOW THE EXAMPLE OF THE DATASET.
utt_0008 utt 53.01 58.39 -X WE ALSO PROPOSE AN EXTREME VFI NETWORK, CALLED XVFI-NET.
utt_0009 utt 58.39 64.15 -X IT HAS SEVERAL PROPERTIES SPECIALIZED FOR INTERPOLATING HIGH-RESOLUTION FRAMES.
utt_0010 utt 64.15 70.35 -X EVEN IF TRAINING IS ONCE OVER, OUR XVFI-NET IS SCALE ADAPTIVE TO THE VARIOUS SPATIAL RESOLUTION.
utt_0011 utt 71.50 77.11 -X AND XVFI-NET IS STRUCTURALLY EFFICIENT DURING INFERENCE AND ESTIMATES OPTICAL FLOW STABLY.
utt_0012 utt 78.89 85.65 -X FOR THE PROPOSED DATASET, WE PHOTOGRAPHED fourK RESOLUTION AT one thousandFPS WITH VARIOUS SCENES.
utt_0013 utt 86.00 95.54 -X THEN, WE BUILD THE DATASET CONSIDERING THE SCENE DIVERSITY AND DEGREE OF OCCLUSION AND OPTICAL FLOW EXTRACTED AS SHOWN IN THE BELOW FIGURE.
utt_0014 utt 95.92 104.69 -X AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE, OUR DATASETS CONTAIN COMPARABLE OCCLUSION BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER MOTION COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS VFI DATASETS.
utt_0015 utt 107.95 111.76 -X XfourKone thousandFPS CONSISTS OF X-TEST AND X-TRAIN.
utt_0016 utt 111.76 116.44 -X X-TEST CONTAINS fifteen SCENES OF fourK RESOLUTION TO EVALUATE VFI METHODS.
utt_0017 utt 116.44 124.40 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, X-TRAIN CONTAINS ABOUT four,zero CLIPS OF CROPPED PATCHES FOR THE TRAINING PHASE.
utt_0018 utt 124.72 128.40 -X OUR DATASETS ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AT GITHUB PAGE.
utt_0019 utt 130.38 134.58 -X THIS IS THE XVFI-NET FRAMEWORK.
utt_0020 utt 134.58 141.59 -X IT HAS A SHARED RECURSIVE MULTI-SCALE STRUCTURE THAT CAN ADAPT TO SPATIAL RESOLUTION AND DEGREE OF MOTION OF INPUT FRAMES.
utt_0021 utt 142.93 153.59 -X AFTER THE TRAINING, XVFI-NET CAN START FROM ANY DOWN-SCALED INPUT UPWARD, FROM AN EVEN SMALLER SCALE.
utt_0022 utt 154.26 161.62 -X AT THE SAME TIME, THE SECOND MODULE, BIOF-T, ONLY OPERATES AT THE ORIGINAL SCALE EFFICIENTLY AT INFERENCE.
utt_0023 utt 163.06 169.27 -X AND OUR METHOD ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE ON HR DATASETS WITH A LIGHTWEIGHT STRUCTURE.
utt_0024 utt 170.48 175.51 -X THIS FIGURE SHOWS THE ARCHITECTURE AT EACH SCALE.
utt_0025 utt 175.51 182.77 -X IN BIOF-I MODULE, BIDIRECTIONAL OPTICAL FLOWS BETWEEN INPUT FRAMES ARE ESTIMATED FROM RECURSIVELY DOWNSAMPLED FEATURES.
utt_0026 utt 183.12 187.92 -X THE PREDICTED OPTICAL FLOWS ARE PROVIDED TO THE NEXT SCALE LEVEL.
utt_0027 utt 188.75 197.94 -X AND IN BIOF-T MODULE, OPTICAL FLOWS FROM TIME T TO INPUT FRAMES ARE APPROXIMATED BY CFR WHICH WILL BE DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT SLIDE.
utt_0028 utt 198.48 205.72 -X THE APPROXIMATED OPTICAL FLOWS ARE REFINED AND USED TO WARP THE INPUT FRAMES TO INTERPOLATE THE TARGET FRAME.
utt_0029 utt 205.72 210.77 -X THE WARPED FRAMES ARE REFINED TO BE THE FINAL RESULT AT THIS SCALE LEVEL.
utt_0030 utt 211.25 219.32 -X AS DESCRIBED IN THE ARCHITECTURE SLIDE, OUR METHOD IS BASED ON THE WARPING OPERATION BY OPTICAL FLOW FROM TIME T TO INPUT FRAMES.
utt_0031 utt 219.32 227.93 -X THESE CAN BE OBTAINED BY THE FLOW REVERSAL OF THE OPTICAL FLOWS BETWEEN INPUT FRAMES.
utt_0032 utt 227.93 230.52 -X HOWEVER, THIS CAUSES HOLES TO APPEAR.
utt_0033 utt 231.41 235.93 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, TWO BIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.
utt_0034 utt 236.63 242.87 -X THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL FLOW APPROXIMATION CALLED COMPLEMENTARY FLOW REVERSAL, CFR.
utt_0035 utt 244.37 249.24 -X COMPARED TO THE FLOW REVERSAL, CFR IS HELPED BY THE COMPLEMENTARY FLOW,
utt_0036 utt 249.39 254.10 -X WHICH EFFECTIVELY REMOVES THE HOLES BY REDUCING THE POSSIBLE EMPTY SETS, None’S.
utt_0037 utt 256.40 259.77 -X JIHYONG WILL NOW EXPLAIN THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.
utt_0038 utt 260.69 263.38 -X FROM NOW ON, JIHYONG WILL NARRATE THE LAST HALF.
utt_0039 utt 263.38 269.66 -X WE COMPARE OUR XVFI-NET WITH THREE PREVIOUS VFI METHODS, WHOSE TRAINING CODES ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.
utt_0040 utt 269.81 278.94 -X FOR A FAIR COMPARISON, WE RETRAIN THE PREVIOUS METHODS ON X-TRAIN UNDER THEIR ORIGINAL HYPERPARAMETER SETTINGS WHILE SETTING THE SAME TOTAL ITERATIONS OF XVFI-NET.
utt_0042 utt 279.35 285.40 -X THIS TABLE SHOWS QUANTITATIVE COMPARISONS FOR MULTI-FRAME-INTERPOLATION ON BOTH X-TEST AND ADOBE DATASET.
utt_0043 utt 287.19 295.32 -X OUR XVFI-NET WITH S_{TST} SET TO BOTH three AND five CLEARLY OUTPERFORM ALL THE PREVIOUS METHODS WITH LARGE MARGINS ON BOTH DATASETS,
utt_0044 utt 295.60 301.50 -X EVEN THOUGH THE NUMBER OF MODEL PARAMETERS OF OUR MODEL IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE OTHERS.
utt_0045 utt 303.38 312.82 -X IT IS ALSO WORTHWHILE TO NOTE THAT OUR MODEL CAN OPERATE ON fourK FRAME AT ONCE, WITHOUT ANY PATCH-WISE ITERATION WITH THE HELP OF THE LIGHTER MODEL SIZE.
utt_0046 utt 312.82 320.02 -X ESPECIALLY FOR THE X-TEST WHICH CONTAINS EXTREME MOTIONS IN fourK FRAMES, OUR MODEL CAN EFFECTIVELY CAPTURE LARGE MOTION IN EARLIER STAGES.
utt_0047 utt 320.47 328.54 -X XVFI-NET CAN ALSO SYNTHESIZE TEMPORALLY CONSISTENT FRAMES DUE TO CFR, TO PRECISELY APPROXIMATE INTERMEDIATE FLOWS.
utt_0048 utt 329.20 339.48 -X CENTER-FRAME INTERPOLATION METHODS SUCH AS ADACOF, FEFLOW TEND TO SYNTHESIZE INTERMEDIATE FRAMES GENERALLY WORSE THAN THOSE OF ARBITRARY TIME VFI METHODS SUCH AS DAIN AND OURS.
utt_0049 utt 339.73 346.36 -X THE ERRORS OF THE CFI METHODS TEND TO BE ACCUMULATED ITERATIVELY DUE TO INACCURATE PREDICTIONS.
utt_0050 utt 346.52 350.81 -X OUR MODEL CAN ACCURATELY GENERATE INTERMEDIATE FRAMES AT ARBITRARY TIME T.
utt_0051 utt 352.92 361.72 -X THIS TENDENCY CAN CONSISTENTLY BE INSPECTED IN PSNR PROFILES FOR MULTI-FRAME-INTERPOLATION ON X-TEST, AS SHOWN IN THIS FIGURE.
utt_0052 utt 362.68 366.17 -X THIS FIGURE SHOWS THE VISUAL COMPARISON ON fourK X-TEST.
utt_0053 utt 367.38 371.29 -X THE FIRST COLUMN IMAGES SHOW OVERLAPPED TWO fourK INPUT FRAMES.
utt_0054 utt 371.29 376.79 -X AS SHOWN, HUGE PIXEL DISPLACEMENTS ARE OBSERVED, WHICH IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR VFI.
utt_0055 utt 377.75 385.98 -X OUR MODEL SURPRISINGLY CAPTURES VERY COMPLEX STRUCTURES OF OBJECTS WITH EXTREMELY FAST MOTIONS, WHICH ARE FAILED BY ALL THE PREVIOUS METHODS.
utt_0056 utt 387.22 397.43 -X THIS VISUAL COMPARISONS ALSO SHOW OUR XVFI-NET’S SUPERIORITY ON THE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS VFI BENCHMARK DATASET NAMED ADOBE DATASET WITH HD RESOLUTION.
utt_0057 utt 397.43 403.23 -X WE COMPARE THE THREE FLOW APPROXIMATIONS THAT ENABLE TO PRODUCE INTERMEDIATE FRAMES AT ARBITRARY TIME T.
utt_0058 utt 403.67 412.15 -X WE APPROXIMATED F_{Tzero} WITH THE THREE METHODS USING THE TWO BIDIRECTIONAL OPTICAL FLOWS WHICH ARE OBTAINED BY IRR-PWC BETWEEN THE INPUTS I_zero AND I_one.
utt_0059 utt 414.17 422.33 -X THE THREE METHODS ARE LINEAR COMBINATION, FLOW REVERSAL AND COMPLEMENTARY FLOW REVERSAL, CALLED CFR.
utt_0060 utt 423.61 432.32 -X THIS FIGURE VISUALIZES AN EXAMPLE OF THE APPROXIMATED OPTICAL FLOWS BY THE THREE METHODS AND THE PSEUDO GROUND TRUTH WHICH IS ESTIMATED BETWEEN I_T AND I_zero BY IRR-PWC.
utt_0061 utt 434.42 439.96 -X THE LINEAR APPROXIMATION REVEALS MISALIGNMENT DUE TO THE DIFFERENT ANCHOR FRAMES.
utt_0062 utt 439.96 448.09 -X THE FLOW REVERSAL RESOLVES THIS PROBLEM, BUT IS INFERIOR TO THE LINEAR APPROXIMATION BECAUSE IT CAUSES HOLES THAT ARE NOT PROJECTED FROM ANY FLOW VECTOR.
utt_0063 utt 449.08 456.32 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR PROPOSED CFR CAN APPROPRIATELY FILL IN THE HOLES SINCE THE BIDIRECTIONAL FLOWS COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.
utt_0064 utt 458.01 466.08 -X THE PREVIOUS VISUAL TENDENCY IS ALSO CONSISTENTLY SHOWN IN A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION BY ENDPOINT ERROR ON VIMEO DATASET.
utt_0065 utt 466.08 472.12 -X THE AVERAGED EPES FOR THE THREE METHODS ARE CALCULATED BETWEEN THE APPROXIMATED FLOWS AND THE PSEUDO GROUND TRUTH.
utt_0066 utt 472.63 480.41 -X WE ALSO TRAINED THREE VFI MODELS FROM SCRATCH BY ADOPTING EACH OF THE THREE FLOW APPROXIMATIONS IN THEIR BIOF-T MODULES.
utt_0067 utt 480.41 485.31 -X THIS COMPARISON ALSO SHOWS A SUPERIORITY OF OUR PROPOSED CFR FOR VFI.
utt_0068 utt 486.68 495.68 -X THE LOWEST SCALE DEPTH S_{TST} FOR THE INFERENCE CAN BE ADAPTIVE TO THE DEGREE OF MOTION MAGNITUDES AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE INPUT FRAMES, EVEN AFTER ONCE TRAINED.
utt_0069 utt 496.38 502.56 -X WE SHOW THE ADJUSTABLE SCALABILITY OF OUR FRAMEWORK FOR DIVERSE COMBINATIONS OF S_{TRN} AND S_{TST}.
utt_0070 utt 503.64 515.68 -X AS SHOWN IN THIS TABLE, THE PERFORMANCES ARE GENERALLY BOOSTED BY INCREASING S_{TST} WITH THE HELP OF EFFECTIVELY ENLARGING RECEPTIVE FIELD SIZES AND ELABORATELY REFINING THE RESULTING FLOWS.
utt_0071 utt 516.31 518.94 -X THIS TREND IS ALSO OBSERVED IN THIS FIGURE.
utt_0072 utt 519.58 526.59 -X THE DETAILS OF THE OBJECTS, LETTERS AND TEXTURES ARE MORE PRECISELY SYNTHESIZED FOR S_{TST} OF five THAN three VISUALLY.
utt_0073 utt 526.59 533.76 -X THIS FIGURE SHOWS THE VISUALIZATION OF LEARNED OPTICAL FLOWS AND OCCLUSION MASKS OF OUR NETWORK.
utt_0074 utt 534.17 539.26 -X AS EXPECTED, ESTIMATED FLOWS AT THE UPPER LEVEL SEEM FINER THAN THOSE AT THE LOWER LEVEL.
utt_0075 utt 539.83 545.63 -X THE COARSE-TO-FINE STRUCTURE GRADUALLY HELPS THE WHOLE XVFI FRAMEWORK BOOST THE FINAL VFI.
utt_0076 utt 547.83 554.11 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, THE OCCLUSIONS AND FLOW MAGNITUDES OF THE ADOBE DATASET ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF X-TEST.
utt_0077 utt 555.07 562.88 -X OUR MODEL CAN ADAPTIVELY SHOW BETTER PERFORMANCE ON THE ADOBE DATASET WITH SMALLER RESOLUTIONS THAN X-TEST BY REGULATING S_{TST},
utt_0078 utt 563.29 567.74 -X WHICH ALSO CLEARLY SUPPORTS THE EFFICACY OF OUR ADJUSTABLE SCALABILITY.
utt_0079 utt 568.03 578.43 -X TO SHOW THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR XVFI-NET FRAMEWORK FOR LR-LFR BENCHMARK DATASET, WE CONSTRUCT A VARIANT CALLED XVFI-NET_V FOR LOWER RESOLUTION.
utt_0080 utt 578.43 584.06 -X WE COMPARE IT WITH FOUR SOTA VFI METHODS IN TERMS OF PSNR, RUNTIME AND MODEL SIZE.
utt_0081 utt 584.38 591.36 -X AS SHOWN, OUR XVFI-NET_V OUTPERFORMS THESE THREE METHODS WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER MODEL SIZE,
utt_0082 utt 591.48 595.90 -X BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE RECURSIVE MULTI-SCALE AND SHARED STRUCTURE.
utt_0083 utt 595.90 606.53 -X HOWEVER, THE XVFI-NET_V SHOWS LOWER PERFORMANCES THAN THOSE OF FEFLOW BUT HAS A MUCH SMALLER MODEL SIZE ONLY WITH five point four% OF THE NUMBER OF THE FEFLOW’S PARAMETERS,
utt_0084 utt 606.53 609.60 -X THUS LEADING TO ABOUT seven TIMES FASTER RUNTIME.
utt_0085 utt 609.82 619.97 -X AS A RESULT, OUR XVFI-NET ALSO SHOWS ITS ROBUSTNESS TO THE LR-LFR BENCHMARK DATASET BY SIMPLY ADJUSTING MODULE SCALE FACTOR M, S_{TRN} AND S_{TST}.
utt_0086 utt 621.34 627.84 -X THIS VISUAL COMPARISON ALSO QUALITATIVELY SUPPORTS OUR FRAMEWORK’S ROBUSTNESS ON VIMEO DATASET.
utt_0087 utt 628.70 633.18 -X FOLLOWING DEMO VIDEOS SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOW FOUR fourK X-TEST VIDEO RESULTS.
utt_0088 utt 633.37 638.11 -X ALL eight TIMES LONGER RESULTS ARE ENCODED AT thirty FPS TO BE PLAYED AS SLOW MOTION VIDEO.
utt_0089 utt 638.56 644.64 -X THE INPUT FRAMES HAVE fourK RESOLUTION OF thirty FPS AND ARE CONVERTED TO 2four0 FPS BY EACH VFI METHOD.
utt_0090 utt 646.72 651.33 -X FOR THE FIRST SCENE WITH EVEN EXTREME BACK AND FORTH MOTIONS OF A PROPELLER WITH ZOOM-OUT,
utt_0091 utt 651.55 662.82 -X OUR XVFI-NET CAN SURPRISINGLY CAPTURE SUCH A COMPLEX MOTION, BUT THE SOTAS FAIL TO INTERPOLATE THE SOPHISTICATED TIPS OF THE PROPELLER, POINTED BY THE YELLOW ARROWS.
utt_0093 utt 663.61 667.20 -X FOR THIS SCENE, THE RIGHTMOST FRONT CAR MOVES VERY FAST,
utt_0094 utt 667.20 672.58 -X SO ALL THE PREVIOUS METHODS FAIL TO CAPTURE IT, DENOTED BY THE YELLOW ARROW, YIELDING SEVERE ARTIFACTS.
utt_0095 utt 672.77 678.02 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, XVFI-NET PRECISELY CAPTURES THE ESPECIALLY RIGHT EDGES OF THE RIGHTMOST CAR.
utt_0096 utt 678.17 681.31 -X FOR THE LAST SCENE, EVEN WHILE RIDING A FAST-MOVING CAR,
utt_0097 utt 681.44 692.32 -X XVFI-NET BETTER CAPTURES FAR TINY STRUCTURES SUCH AS ELECTRIC WIRES SEEN AT THE LEFT PART AND A CLOSER POLE WITH A LARGE PIXEL DISPLACEMENT, POINTED BY THE YELLOW ARROWS.
utt_0098 utt 693.15 700.77 -X ALL RELEVANT CODES INCLUDING THE PROPOSED DATASET ARE RELEASED ON GITHUB. PLEASE VISIT US AT SESSION eleven FOR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.
