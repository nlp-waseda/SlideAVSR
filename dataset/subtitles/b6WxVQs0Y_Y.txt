utt_0014 utt 59.06 62.26 -X IN THIS STUDY, WE TARGETED THREE KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
utt_0015 utt 62.26 66.14 -X one. FIRST, ARE PERIPHERAL GUIDES EFFECTIVE DURING INTERRUPTED WORK?
utt_0016 utt 66.42 70.60 -X PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS STUDIED FOCUSED TASKS AND IT’S STILL NOT CLEAR IF GUIDES CAN BE
utt_0018 utt 74.06 85.77 -X WORLD WORK. two. SECOND, DO PERIPHERAL GUIDES CREATE INCREASES IN HEART-RATE VARIABILITY (OR HRV, FOR SHORT), WHICH IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKER THAT UNDERLIES BENEFIT? PREVIOUS WORK HAS ONLY LOOKED FOR REDUCTIONS
utt_0021 utt 85.77 94.78 -X IN BREATHING RATE. HOWEVER, THE BENEFITS OF GUIDED BREATHING ACTUALLY ARISE FROM CHANGES IN HRV. SINCE OUR STUDY IS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED TO MIMIC REAL WORLD DISTRACTIONS THAT MAKE

utt_0025 utt 100.25 113.14 -X three. THIRD AND FINALLY, HOW SHOULD GUIDES BE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT ADOPTION AND USE IN THE WORKPLACE? EVEN IF SHOWN EFFECTIVE, MANY FACTORS WILL INFLUENCE IF AND HOW GUIDES ARE INCORPORATED INTO DAILY WORK (FOR EXAMPLE, WHETHER PEOPLE
utt_0029 utt 117.60 120.64 -X HOW BEST TO DESIGN GUIDES THAT SUPPORT WORKPLACE ADOPTION AND USE.
utt_0030 utt 120.99 129.03 -X TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, WE COMPARED FIVE DESIGNS FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH MANY GUIDES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED TO DATE, WE FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON DESIGNS THAT:
utt_0033 utt 131.36 138.05 -X two. ...WOULD NOT OBVIOUSLY INTERFERE WITH NEARBY CO-WORKERS, AND three. ...COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO COMMON DEVICES LIKE MOBILE PHONES OR COMPUTER DISPLAYS.
utt_0035 utt 139.01 151.68 -X THIS RESULTED IN THE FOLLOWING FIVE GUIDES: one. AN ONSCREEN BAR THAT RISES AND FALLS TO GUIDE BREATHING AT THE TARGET RATE two. AN ONSCREEN BRIGHTNESS GUIDE THAT CAUSES THE ENTIRE DISPLAY TO SUBTLY INCREASE AND DECREASE IN BRIGHTNESS
utt_0038 utt 151.68 165.38 -X three. A PHONE-BASED DESK WIDGET THAT ALSO USES A BRIGHTNESS-BASED CUE, BUT IS DELIVERED USING A MOBILE PHONE AS A SECONDARY DISPLAY. four. FADING HAPTIC VIBRATIONS THAT PULSED AT THE TARGET BREATHING RATE USING A MOBILE PHONE IN THE USER’S POCKET, AND
utt_0041 utt 165.47 171.03 -X five. AN AUDIO MELODY THAT GUIDED INHALES AND EXHALES WITH A SERIES OF RISING AND FALLING MUSIC NOTES
utt_0043 utt 172.32 176.14 -X OUR EVALUATION CONSISTED OF A MIXED-METHODS STUDY:
utt_0044 utt 176.14 185.83 -X FIRST, WE CONDUCTED A twenty-five PARTICIPANT, LAB-BASED COMPARISON TO DETERMINE IF GUIDES COULD INCREASE HRV DURING INTERRUPTED WORK, AND WHETHER THESE EFFECTS DIFFERED BETWEEN GUIDES.
utt_0046 utt 185.83 191.98 -X NEXT, AN INTERVIEW-BASED THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY WHICH DESIGN ELEMENTS INFLUENCED OPINIONS ABOUT ADOPTION AND USE.
utt_0048 utt 192.97 205.53 -X IN OUR PAPER WE PRESENT FINDINGS AND DESIGN INSIGHTS TO SUPPORT WORKPLACE PERIPHERAL BREATHING GUIDES. ONE CRITICAL FINDING OF OUR STUDY IS THAT ALL FIVE GUIDES INCREASED HRV DURING INTERRUPTED WORK, AND NONE PROVIDED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER
utt_0051 utt 205.53 210.54 -X EFFECTS. IMPORTANTLY, THIS OCCURRED DESPITE FREQUENT DISTRACTION AND BREATHING MISALIGNMENT.
utt_0052 utt 211.85 225.58 -X THIS INDICATES THAT A WIDE RANGE OF GUIDES CAN LEAD TO THE MARKERS OF BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH LONG TERM SUCCESS, EVEN WHEN PEOPLE AREN’T ABLE TO FOLLOW THE GUIDES AT ALL TIMES. OUR FUTURE WORK SEEKS TO DEPLOY BREATHING GUIDES FOR LONGER TERM USE OVER THE COURSE OF A FULL
utt_0055 utt 225.58 239.12 -X WORK DAY. THIS ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF HRV AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE, SINCE AN EVALUATION BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON OBSERVING SLOWED BREATHING RATES WOULD LIKELY OVERLOOK THIS BENEFIT. SECOND, DESPITE THE BENEFITS, OUR FINDINGS
utt_0058 utt 239.12 244.75 -X INDICATE THAT INTERRUPTIONS WERE A KEY PAIN-POINT. DECREASED HRV WAS OBSERVED AFTER EACH INTERRUPTION,
utt_0059 utt 244.75 247.60 -X AND PARTICIPANTS HAD DIFFICULTY RESYNCHRONIZING THEIR BREATH.
utt_0060 utt 247.92 261.23 -X THIS HIGHLIGHTS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE COMPARED TO FOCUSED EXERCISE - IN ADDITION TO BEING EASY AND INTUITIVE TO FOLLOW, PERIPHERAL GUIDES SHOULD ALSO SUPPORT FAST AND EFFICIENT RECOVERY WHEN MISALIGNMENTS OCCUR. FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE FOUND RESYNCING WITH THE BRIGHTNESS-BASED
utt_0063 utt 261.23 265.59 -X GUIDES DIFFICULT, BUT FOUND THE AUDIO GUIDE MUCH LESS CHALLENGING.
utt_0064 utt 265.59 277.53 -X FINALLY, PARTICIPANTS HIGHLIGHTED MANY PERSONAL AND CONTEXTUAL FACTORS THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THEIR WILLINGNESS FOR USE INCLUDING THE TYPE OF WORK THEY COMMONLY PERFORM, WHETHER THEY TYPICALLY WORK AROUND OTHERS, AND THEIR WORKPLACE CULTURE IN GENERAL.
utt_0067 utt 277.81 285.69 -X SINCE OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT A WIDE RANGE OF GUIDES CAN BE EFFECTIVE, DESIGNERS CAN CATER TO THESE FACTORS AND ADAPT TO USER NEEDS.
utt_0069 utt 285.69 296.28 -X IN CLOSING, OUR FINDINGS CONTRIBUTE IMPORTANT DESIGN INSIGHTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE ADOPTION AND USE OF WORKPLACE PERIPHERAL BREATHING GUIDES - A SIMPLE TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD PROVIDE BOTH IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND WELLNESS BENEFITS.
