utt_0000 utt 0.32 10.26 -X HI EVERYONE MY NAME IS LEIMA I'M A PHD STUDENT FROM WPI TODAY I'M PRESENTING GLORIA GRAPH-BASED THE SHARING OPTIMIZER FOR INVENTORY AND AGGREGATION
utt_0002 utt 10.32 17.30 -X THIS WORK IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN WPI INSTACART AND MICROSOFT LET'S START WITH THE MOTIVATION
utt_0003 utt 17.52 30.48 -X SO IN A CURRENT DATA AGE STREAMING DATA IS EVERYWHERE FOR EXAMPLE IN UBER USE CASE THE STREAM IS CONTINUOUSLY GENERATED CONSISTED OF UBER RELATED EVENTS WITH SUCH STREAM WE MAY CARE ABOUT
utt_0005 utt 30.48 36.72 -X QUESTIONS REVEALING BUSINESS INSIGHTS LIKE HOW MANY TRIPS FINISHED OR GET CANCELLED IN thirty MINUTES
utt_0006 utt 37.29 50.75 -X AND THESE QUESTIONS CAN BE FORMALIZED AS INVENTORY AND AGGREGATION QUERIES EACH QUERY SPECIFIES THE AGGREGATION FUNCTION THE PATTERN WHICH DEFINES THE COMPLEX EVENTS THE PREDICATES GROUP BY AND WINDOWS
utt_0008 utt 51.69 64.43 -X WITH THE EVENTS ARRIVING THE STREAM PROCESS ENGINE SEARCHES FOR MATCH THE INVENTORIES FOR EACH QUERY AND OUTPUTS THE AGGREGATION RESULTS HOWEVER WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS QUERIES IN A WORKLOAD
utt_0010 utt 64.43 77.36 -X THE PATTERNS OF THESE QUERIES COULD BE SIMILAR IF EACH QUERY IS EXECUTED SEPARATELY THE COMMENTS THE PATTERN WILL BE EXECUTED MULTIPLE TIMES TO AVOID SUCH A SCENARIO WE CONSIDER PATTERN SHARING
utt_0012 utt 77.36 82.45 -X TO REDUCE THE COMPUTATION SO THAT THE COMMENTS OF PATTERN CAN BE EXECUTED ONCE FOR ALL
utt_0013 utt 83.15 94.58 -X HOWEVER THE PATTERN SHARING COULD BE COMPLICATED DIFFERENT PATTERNS CAN OVERLAP ON ARBITRARY PART WHICH LEADS TO MANY POSSIBLE WORKLOAD SHARING PLANS OUR GOAL IS THAT GIVING
utt_0015 utt 94.58 104.75 -X A WORKLOAD CONTAINING BOTH SEQUENCE AND CLEANING PATTERNS WE FIND THE OPTIMIZED WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN OF PATTERN SHARING SO THAT THE AVERAGE LATENCY PER QUERY CAN BE MINIMIZED
utt_0017 utt 105.74 116.82 -X THIS PROBLEM HAS SEVERAL HARD CHALLENGES FIRST COMES FROM THE QUERY COMPLEXITY THE CLEANING OPERATORS LEAD TO AN EXPONENTIAL NUMBER OF MATCHED EVENT TRENDS IN A WORST CASE
utt_0019 utt 116.94 122.83 -X ALSO THE CLEANING PATTERNS COULD BE NESTED WHICH MAKES ANALYSIS OF THE SHARING OPPORTUNITIES HARDER
utt_0020 utt 124.05 134.55 -X THE SECOND CHALLENGE COMES FROM THE SHARING WE WANT THE SHARING OPPORTUNITIES CAN BE FULLY EXPLOITED WITHOUT ANY CONSTRAINTS ONLY IN THIS CASE THE OPTIMIZATION CAN BE FULLY LEVERAGED
utt_0022 utt 134.70 148.66 -X ALSO WE NEED AN ACCURATE COST MODEL TO CAPTURE THE EXECUTION COST OF DIFFERENT SHARING PLANS HOWEVER THE FLEXIBILITY OF ARBITRARY SHARING LEADS TO AN EXPONENTIAL SEARCH SPACE IN A WORST CASE THE STATE
utt_0024 utt 148.66 154.35 -X OF OUR METHODS DO NOT FULLY SOLVE THE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE AGGREGATION STRATEGY
utt_0025 utt 154.38 166.59 -X SOME METHODS ADOPT A TWO-STEP INSTEAD OF ONLINE AGGREGATION STRATEGY WHICH MEANS THAT THE INVENTORIES ARE CONSTRUCTED FIRST THEN AGGREGATED THIS WILL LEAD TO EXPONENTIAL COMPLEXITY FOR
utt_0027 utt 166.59 172.88 -X CLEANING PATTERNS IN TERMS OF CLINIC TYPE SOME OF THEM SUPPORT LIMITED OR EVEN NON-CLEANING PATTERNS
utt_0028 utt 173.04 186.45 -X AS FOR THE SHARING DECISIONS SOME METHODS APPLY CONSTRAINTS ON SHARING THEREFORE THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT FULLY EXPLOITED WE PROPOSE GLORIA A SHARING OPTIMIZER FOR INVENTION AGGREGATION
utt_0030 utt 186.51 191.51 -X SO ADOPTS THE EFFICIENT ONLINE AGGREGATION STRATEGY FOR THE CLEANING PATTERNS
utt_0031 utt 191.54 198.87 -X MEANWHILE BY PROVIDING FLEXIBLE SHARING DECISIONS GLORIA OPTIMIZES FOR THE SHARING PLAN OF WORKLOAD
utt_0032 utt 198.87 212.66 -X CONTAINING BOTH SEQUENCE AND COMPLICATED CLEANING PATTERNS THE FRAMEWORK OF GLORIA HAS TWO PARTS THE OPTIMIZER AND THE EXECUTOR IN HIGH LEVEL THE OPTIMIZER TAKES IN THE WORKLOAD OF QUERIES AND
utt_0034 utt 212.66 224.56 -X THE STREAM STATISTICS THEN GENERATES AN OPTIMAL WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN FOR THE EXECUTOR THEN THE EXECUTOR TAKES IN THE INPUT STREAM AND OUTPUT AGGREGATE AGGREGATION RESULTS FOR THE WORKLOAD
utt_0036 utt 225.07 237.11 -X OUR MAIN CONTRIBUTION LIES IN THE GLORIA OPTIMIZER WE FIRST TRANSFORM THE SEARCH SPACE INTO A GLOROGRAPH THAT'S THE OPTIMUM PATH IN THE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE OPTIMAL WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN
utt_0038 utt 237.23 243.09 -X THEN WITH THE COST MODEL WE PROPOSE PRUNING RULES THAT EFFECTIVELY PRUNES THE GRAPH
utt_0039 utt 243.18 248.28 -X THEN WITH THE PRUNE GRAPH THE SHARING PLAN FINDER FINDS THE OPTIMAL PATH IN THE GRAPH
utt_0040 utt 249.90 252.98 -X WE FIRST INTRODUCE WHAT IS THE WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN
utt_0041 utt 253.49 266.04 -X TO ANALYZE THE SHARING OPPORTUNITIES WE FIRST TRANSFORM THE WORKLOAD INTO A REPRESENTATION CALLED TEMPLATE EACH VERTEX IS THE EVENT TYPE AND THE TRANSITION BETWEEN TWO EVENT TYPE REPRESENTS
utt_0043 utt 266.04 272.10 -X AN OPERATOR LIKE SEQUENCE OR CLEANING EACH TRANSITION IS LABELED BY THE QUERIES THAT OWN IT
utt_0044 utt 272.91 283.83 -X GIVEN A TRANSITION WITH MULTIPLE QUERIES THE SHARING PLAN IN A TRANSITION LEVEL NEEDS TO DECIDE WHICH QUERIES TO SHARE TOGETHER THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A SET PARTITION PROBLEM
utt_0046 utt 284.15 291.22 -X IN OUR CASE THE SET OF THREE HAS FIVE PARTITIONS THE QUERIES IN A SAME SUBSET ARE SHARED TOGETHER
utt_0047 utt 291.31 304.02 -X SO IN GENERAL GIVING A TRANSITION OF N QUERIES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRANSITION SHARING PLANS IS THE BARE NUMBER OF IN IF WE ENUMERATE ALL THE SHARING PLANS FOR EACH TRANSITION
utt_0049 utt 304.15 311.13 -X THE WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN IS A SELECTION OF ONE TRANSITION SHARING PLAN ON EACH TRANSITION SO GIVE
utt_0050 utt 311.15 317.78 -X UH MM TRANSITIONS THE SIZE OF THE WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN SEARCH SPACE IS M TO THE NTH BAIL NUMBER
utt_0051 utt 318.67 332.61 -X HERE WE INTRODUCE THE CORE OF THE GLORY OPTIMIZER THE GRAPH MODEL TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE SEARCH SPACE MEANWHILE FINDING THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION WE TRANSFORM THE SEARCH SPACE INTO A GRAPH SO THAT
utt_0053 utt 332.61 344.53 -X THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION CORRESPONDS TO THE OPTIMAL PATH IN THE GRAPH IN THIS CASE PROPERTIES OF THE OPTIMAL PATH CAN BE LEVERAGED DURING GRAPH CONSTRUCTION PRUNING AND ALSO PASS SEARCH
utt_0055 utt 345.68 358.26 -X SO GIVE A TEMPLATE WITH MULTIPLE TRANSITIONS WE SEQUENTIALLY ENUMERATE THE TRANSITION SHARING PLANS FOR EACH TRANSITION AS NODES THE SET OF NODES FOR THE SAME TRANSITION IS CALLED A POOL IF
utt_0057 utt 358.26 371.77 -X TWO TRANSITIONS ARE CONSECUTIVE IN THE TEMPLATE WE CONNECT THE NODES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PORTS USING DIRECTED EDGES TO INDICATE THE START OF THE EXECUTION WE ADD A STAR NODE FOR EACH QUERY SAME
utt_0059 utt 371.77 385.24 -X AS NORMAL NODES THESE STAR NODES WILL BE CONNECTED TO ALL NODES OF THE SUCCEEDING POOL SIMILARLY WE CREATE AN END NODE FOR EACH QUERY AND SINCE ALL THREE QUERIES END WITH THE SAME INVITE TYPE WE
utt_0061 utt 385.24 391.80 -X ONLY HAVE ONE COMMON ENDNOTE HERE AND THIS WILL BE CONNECTED FROM THE ORDINALS IN THE PRECEDING POOL
utt_0062 utt 392.79 399.26 -X WITH THE GRAPH WE DEFINE A PATH AS IT STARTS FROM OR STAR NODES PASSING EACH POOL BY
utt_0063 utt 399.48 411.91 -X ONE NODE AND END WITH ALL IN NODES RECORD THAT A WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN IS A SELECTION OF A TRANSITION SHARING PLAN FOR EACH TRANSITION SO HERE EACH PATH IN A GLORIA GRAPH REPRESENTS A
utt_0065 utt 411.91 418.46 -X UNIQUE WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN TO FIND THE OPTIMAL WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN WITH MINIMUM EXECUTION COST
utt_0066 utt 418.48 423.21 -X WE ENCODE THE EXECUTION COST INTO THE GRAPH AS WEIGHTS OF THE AGES
utt_0067 utt 424.66 437.03 -X FOR EACH CONSECUTIVE FORCE THE EDGES ARE WEIGHTED BY THE EXECUTION COST OF THE COMMON EVENT TYPE FOR THE COMMON QUERIES USING THE TRANSITION SHARING PLANS ON ITS SIDE SUCH ENCODING MAKES SURE THAT
utt_0069 utt 437.03 442.94 -X THE EXECUTION COST OF EACH EVENT TYPE FOR EACH QUERY IS COVERED BY A CERTAIN SET OF EDGES
utt_0070 utt 444.44 457.21 -X AFTER THE ENCODING EACH PATH NOT ONLY REPRESENTS A UNIQUE WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN THE WEIGHT OF IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE EXECUTION COST OF THE SHARING PLAN THUS OUR GOAL IS TO FIND THE OPTIMAL PATH
utt_0072 utt 457.21 464.18 -X WITH THE MINIMUM WEIGHT IN A GRAPH BASED ON THE GLORY GRAPH MODEL WE INTRODUCED THE OPTIMIZER
utt_0073 utt 464.28 474.71 -X WE START WITH OPTIMIZATION OF SEQUENCE PATTERNS THE OPTIMIZATION OF CLEANING PATTERNS WILL BE INTRODUCED IN THE NEXT SECTION THE GOALS OF THE OPTIMIZATIONS
utt_0075 utt 474.71 481.72 -X ARE TWO-FOLD FIRST THE OPTIMIZER NEEDS TO REDUCE THE GRAPH SIZE WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE OPTIMALITY
utt_0076 utt 481.97 487.96 -X THEN WITH THE COMPACT GRAPH IT APPLIES THE PASSAGE ALGORITHM TO FIND THE OPTIMAL PATH
utt_0077 utt 489.81 503.99 -X FOR THE PHYSICAL GRAPH REDUCTION INSTEAD OF CONSTRUCT THEN PROOF WE PUSH THE REDUCTION FORWARD INTO THE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION PHASE THE GRAPH IS CONSTRUCTED PULL BY POOL ACCORDING TO A TEMPLATE
utt_0079 utt 505.14 518.83 -X FOR EACH PORT WE PROPOSE NO GENERATION RULES BASED ON THE COST MODEL TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF NODES NEED TO BE GENERATED FOR EACH POOL THEREAFTER IS GENERATED WE APPLY PRUNING RULES BASED ON THE
utt_0081 utt 518.83 533.63 -X OPTIMAL PASS PROPERTIES OF THE GRAPH THESE PRUNING RODS WILL REDUCE BOTH THE EDGES AND NODES OF THIS POOL AFTER THE CURRENT POOL IS PRUNED IT'S READY FOR EXTENSION FOR THE NEXT POOL DUE TO THE LIMITED
utt_0083 utt 533.63 540.83 -X TIME WE WILL FOCUS ON THE PRUNING RULES PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAPER FOR OTHER DETAILS SO AFTER
utt_0084 utt 540.83 549.15 -X A POOL IS CONSTRUCTED EACH NODE IN IT WILL HAVE MULTIPLE INCOMING EDGES FROM THE PRECEDING POOL
utt_0085 utt 549.15 564.03 -X HOWEVER WITH THE OPTIMAL PATH AS THE GOAL FOR A NODE IN THE OPTIMIZER ONLY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ONE PATH FROM THE STAR NODES TO END WITH THE MINIMUM WEIGHT ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE OTHER INCOMING
utt_0087 utt 564.03 570.81 -X AGES OF N THAT'S NOT ON THIS PATH CAN BE SAFELY PRUNED WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE OPTIMAL PATH
utt_0088 utt 573.46 586.36 -X IN TERMS OF NODE PRUNING GIVEN TWO NODES AND ONE AND Nthree IN A SAMPLE IF WE KNOW THAT A PAST PASSING ENTRY HAS HEAVIER WEIGHT THAN A PASS PASSING ON ONE THIS ENTRY CAN BE SAFELY IMPROVED
utt_0090 utt 586.87 599.35 -X HOWEVER WE ONLY KNOW THE DISTANCES FROM THE STAR NODE TO None AND Nthree SO FAR THEIR DISTANCES TO THE END NODES THEY ALL KNOW BEFORE THE GRAPH CONSTRUCTION IS FINISHED
utt_0092 utt 601.53 616.41 -X TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE DEFINE COMPARABLE NODES BASED ON THE COST MODEL ACCORDING TO THIS DEFINITION IF TWO NODES ARE COMPARABLE THEIR DISTANCES TO THE END NODES CAN BE COMPARED EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL VALUE
utt_0095 utt 617.11 624.57 -X SUPPOSE None AND three ARE COMPARABLE WE CAN DECIDE WHICH ONE HAS A LARGER DISTANCE TO THE END NODE
utt_0096 utt 624.57 632.22 -X BY OUR COST MODEL WITH THE ESTIMATION IF A NODE HAS BOTH HEAVIER PATHS TO THE START
utt_0097 utt 632.25 638.11 -X AND THE END NODE THIS NODE LEADS TO HEAVIER PATHS SO THAT IT CAN BE SAFELY PRUNED
utt_0098 utt 639.54 651.52 -X WITH THE PRUNING INSTEAD OF CONSTRUCTING A FULL CHLOROGRAPH ON THE LEFT THE OPTIMIZER ACTUALLY CONSTRUCTS A COMPACT GRAPH ON THE RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN APPLY THE PASS SEARCH ALGORITHM
utt_0100 utt 651.61 655.82 -X DUE TO A TIME LIMIT PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAPER FOR FURTHER DETAILS
utt_0101 utt 657.18 668.19 -X NOW WE FOCUS ON THE OPTIMIZATION OF CLEANING PATTERNS THE CLEANING INTRODUCES CYCLIC DEPENDENCIES IN THE OPTIMIZATION WHICH IS DIFFERENT WITH THE SEQUENTIAL OPTIMIZATION
utt_0103 utt 668.19 680.73 -X FOR SEQUENCE PATTERNS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE FIRST ISOLATE THE CLINIC PART WITH THE SEQUENCE PART IN THE TEMPLATE THEN THE GLORIA OPTIMIZER CONSTRUCTS THE GLORIOUS SUBGRAPH FOR THE SEQUENCE
utt_0105 utt 680.73 686.97 -X PART WHEN YOU REACHES A CLINIC PART IN A TEMPLATE IT WILL CONSTRUCT AN INDIVIDUAL SUBGRAPH FOR IT
utt_0106 utt 687.22 693.37 -X AFTER THAT THE TWO SUBGRAPHS WILL BE CONCATENATED SO THAT THE FURTHER PRUNING CAN BE APPLIED
utt_0107 utt 694.84 699.12 -X THEN A CHLOROGRAPH CAN BE EXTENDED FOR FOLLOWING PART
utt_0108 utt 700.47 703.96 -X HERE WE FOCUS ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CLINIC SUBGRAPH
utt_0109 utt 705.08 716.70 -X BASED ON OUR GLORIA GRAPH MODEL THERE ARE EDGES FROM PRECEDING POOR TO THE SUCCEEDING POOL IN THIS CASE EDGES ARE BOTH WAY THE BLUE NAILS INDICATE THE POOL A B AND THE YELLOW
utt_0111 utt 716.70 722.51 -X ONES INDICATE THE POOL BA THE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF THE NODES IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENT SHARING PLANES
utt_0112 utt 723.16 737.82 -X SO THERE ARE AGES FROM POOL A B TO B A AND VICE VERSA IN THIS CASE THE PATH IN THE SUBGRAPH IS A CYCLE AMONG ALL THE DIFFERENT CYCLES WE DEFINE CONSISTENT PSYCHOPATH A PATH PSYCHOPATH
utt_0114 utt 737.82 750.30 -X ONLY CONNECTS NODES IN A DIFFERENT POSE WITH THE SAME SHARING PLANE AND OUR LEMMA PROVES THAT ONLY THE CONSISTENT PATH ARE BENEFICIAL TO BE KEPT OTHER PATHS CAN BE SAFELY PRUNED
utt_0116 utt 751.96 753.42 -X BASED ON THIS RESULT
utt_0117 utt 755.13 767.90 -X WE HAVE THREE CYCLE PATHS LEFT IN THE CLINIC GRAPH CONNECTING NODES WITH DIFFERENT WITH SAME SHARING PLAN THEN IT WILL BE CONCATENATED WITH THE EXISTING SUBGRAPH OF THE PRECEDING SEQUENCE
utt_0119 utt 767.90 776.70 -X PART AS THE SOURCE OF THE EXTENSION EACH BLUE NODE CAN COMPUTE ITS DISTANCE TO THE STAR NODES
utt_0120 utt 776.70 790.30 -X AS THE WEIGHT OF THE PATH FROM THE STAR NODE TO ITSELF PLUS THE WEIGHT OF ITS CYCLE WITH THE DISTANCE WE APPLY THE NODE PRUNING RULE ON POOR A B THEN THIS GRAPH IS READY FOR EXTENSION
utt_0122 utt 795.03 807.42 -X AND IN THE EXPERIMENT PART WE EVALUATE BOTH THE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF OUR GLORIA OPTIMIZER ON MULTIPLE REAL DATA SETS IN THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY EXPERIMENTS
utt_0124 utt 807.42 820.03 -X WE VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRUNING RULES FOR BASELINE OPTIMIZERS WE HAVE ONE OPTIMIZER WITHOUT PRUNING AND ONE GREEDY OPTIMIZER WHICH ONLY SELECTS THE LOCAL OPTIMAL
utt_0126 utt 820.03 831.71 -X WITHOUT PASS SEARCHING WE MEASURE THE OPTIMIZATION TIME OF THE THREE OPTIMIZERS WHILE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF QUERIES IN THE LEFT AND INCREASING THE PERCENT OF CLEANING PATTERNS IN THE RIGHT
utt_0128 utt 831.90 846.85 -X THANKS TO THE PRUNING RULE WITH THE SAME WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN AS OUTPUT OUR GLORIA OPTIMIZER ACHIEVES A FIVE TO SIX FOLD OUT PERFORMANCE THAN THE OPTIMIZER WITHOUT PRUNING IN OUR OPTIMIZATION
utt_0130 utt 846.85 860.19 -X QUALITY EXPERIMENTS WE COMPARED EXECUTION OF THE GENERATED WORKLOAD SHARING PLAN TO STATE-OF-ART METHODS WHEN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF QUERIES THE SHARING PLAN GENERATED BY GLORIA OUTPERFORMS
utt_0132 utt 860.19 867.07 -X OTHER METHODS BY ten AND THREEFOLD PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAPER FOR FULL CONTENT OF THE EXPERIMENTS
utt_0133 utt 868.00 880.50 -X AS FOR THE CONCLUSION WE PROPOSED A GRAPH-BASED GENERAL OPTIMIZER THAT TRANSFORMED THE OPTIMAL WORKLOAD PLAN TO A PASS-THROUGH PROBLEM AND WE PROPOSED PRUNING RULES TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE
utt_0135 utt 880.50 885.89 -X THE SIZE OF THE CHLOROGRAPH SO THAT'S OUR PASSAGE ALGORITHM CAN FIND THE OPTIMAL PATH
utt_0136 utt 885.95 891.58 -X AND OUR EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE SCANS OVER THE STATE OF OUR METHODS
utt_0137 utt 892.12 898.66 -3.1925 HERE I WANT TO THANK OUR COLLABORATORS IN OUR FOUNDING AGENCY SO ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU
