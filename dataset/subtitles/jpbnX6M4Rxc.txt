utt_0000 utt 0.30 10.35 -X HEY GUYS IN THIS VIDEO I WILL PRESENT THE PAPER: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FEATURE ATTRIBUTION METHODS AND ITS CORRELATION WITH AUTOMATIC EVALUATION SCORES ACCEPTED AT NEURIPS two thousand and twenty-one.
utt_0002 utt 11.24 15.06 -X THIS WORK WAS DONE BY GIANG NGUYEN, DAEYOUNG KIM, AND ANH NGUYEN.
utt_0003 utt 15.88 21.20 -X OVER THE RECENT YEARS, AI HAS ACHIEVED REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE ON MANY DOMAINS,
utt_0004 utt 21.20 24.62 -X EVEN SURPASSING HUMANS IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION.
utt_0005 utt 25.71 31.67 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HERE, AI CAN PRECISELY IDENTIFY THIS IS CABBAGE BUTTERFLY.
utt_0006 utt 33.20 36.56 -X INTERESTINGLY, WITH EXPLAINABLE AI METHODS,
utt_0007 utt 36.56 41.81 -X WE HAVE CLUES INTO WHY AI THINKS THIS IS CABBAGE BUTTERFLY .
utt_0008 utt 42.77 50.19 -X THIS ATTRIBUTION MAP EXPLAINS THE WHITE WING MADE THE AI THINK THIS IS CABBAGE BUTTERFLY.
utt_0009 utt 51.02 57.17 -X THIS FEATURE ATTRIBUTION MAP CAN BE LEVERAGED TO TEACH US HOW TO CLASSIFY BUTTERFLY TYPES,
utt_0010 utt 57.17 62.90 -X LOCALIZE TUMORS IN X-RAY SCANS, OR HIGHLIGHT KEYWORDS IN WALLS OF TEXT.
utt_0011 utt 64.27 73.55 -X GIVEN THE EXPLANATION CAPABILITY OF AI, CAN AI TEAM UP WITH HUMANS TO IMPROVE HUMAN DECISION MAKING IN CHALLENGING OR HIGH-STAKES PROBLEMS?
utt_0013 utt 74.03 84.88 -X FEATURE ATTRIBUTIONS HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL IN IMPROVING USER PERFORMANCE ON TEXTUAL AND TABULAR DATA. HOWEVER, IN IMAGE DOMAIN, THERE WERE LESS SUCCESS STORIES.
utt_0015 utt 86.54 101.52 -X IN THE STANDARD IMAGENET IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, WHERE MANY ATTRIBUTION METHODS WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ATTRIBUTION MAPS IS UNKNOWN. THIS MOTIVATES US TO ASK: ARE ATTRIBUTION
utt_0018 utt 108.98 116.31 -X MOST OF THEM WERE ONLY TESTED ON AUTOMATIC EVALUATION METRICS, SUCH AS POINTING GAME, WEAKLY
utt_0020 utt 126.35 133.40 -X SO DO THESE PROXY EVALUATION METRICS CORRELATE WITH HUMAN ACCURACY IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION?
utt_0021 utt 133.46 135.61 -X IS OUR SECOND RESEARCH QUESTION.
utt_0022 utt 137.55 143.73 -X SO TO ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS, WE PERFORM A USER STUDY ON BOTH LAY AND EXPERT USERS.
utt_0023 utt 144.18 149.56 -X WE COMPARE USER ACCURACY WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN NO EXPLANATIONS,
utt_0024 utt 149.56 153.69 -X OR STATE-OF-THE-ART HEATMAPS EXPLANATIONS AND NEAREST NEIGHBORS.
utt_0025 utt 154.03 160.79 -X TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS, WE USED BOTH REAL AND ADVERSARIAL IMAGES,
utt_0026 utt 161.04 175.93 -X WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE CHALLENGING TO MACHINES AND ALSO HUMANS. WE COME TO OUR FINDINGS. FIRST, WE FOUND THAT HUMAN-AI TEAMS ONLY OUTPERFORM AI ALONE IF HUMANS HAVE EXPERTISE. MORE PRECISELY,
utt_0028 utt 175.93 182.36 -X IN EVERYDAY OBJECTS OF NATURAL IMAGENET, HUMAN-AI TEAMS BEAT AI ALONE BY AROUND six point five PERCENTS. THE
utt_0029 utt 184.05 191.26 -X STORY CHANGED ENTIRELY WHEN HUMANS WERE ASKED TO CLASSIFY DOGS. IT SHOWS A DECREASE OF three point one PERCENTS.
utt_0030 utt 192.85 206.55 -X SECOND, WE ALSO FOUND THAT FEATURE ATTRIBUTION IS NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VERY SIMPLE THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS. IN PARTICULAR, USERS WITH HEATMAPS PERFORM SIMILARLY ON NATURAL IMAGENET BUT MUCH
utt_0032 utt 206.55 215.83 -X WORSE ON STANFORD DOGS AND ADVERSARIAL IMAGENET. IN NATURAL IMAGENET, THEY PERFORM SIMILARLY BUT
utt_0033 utt 215.83 223.29 -X THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS MAY BE MORE INFORMATIVE. CAN YOU GUESS THE NAME OF THIS OBJECT? AI THINKS
utt_0034 utt 223.32 231.39 -X THIS IS LADLE! THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS, IN THIS CASE, INFORM USERS THAT LADLE CAN HAVE A WEIRD SHAPE
utt_0035 utt 231.45 240.09 -X AND HELP USERS CORRECTLY ACCEPT AI PREDICTION OF LADLE. IN NATURAL STANFORD DOGS, THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS
utt_0036 utt 240.09 247.85 -X IS MUCH MORE USEFUL THAN ATTRIBUTION MAPS, WHICH KEEPS HIGHLIGHTING THE DOG FACE REGARDLESS OF WHEN
utt_0037 utt 247.85 256.47 -X MODEL IS CORRECT OR WRONG. IN ADVERSARIAL IMAGENET, HUMANS STILL FOUND THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS MUCH BETTER.
utt_0038 utt 257.62 264.35 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HERE, THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS CONTRAST A LORIKEET AND BEE EATER WHILE
utt_0039 utt 264.41 277.50 -X HEATMAPS DO NOT HELP. OUR THIRD FINDING IS VISUAL EXPLANATIONS CAN EVEN HURT THE HUMAN AI TEAM PERFORMANCE IN CHALLENGING TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE, HERE, ADVERSARIAL STANFORD
utt_0041 utt 277.50 286.40 -X DOGS IS PRETTY DIFFICULT WHEN USERS DO NOT HAVE EXPERTISE AND INPUTS ARE ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES.
utt_0042 utt 287.58 294.46 -X NOT ONLY ATTRIBUTION MAPS BUT THREE NEAREST NEIGHBORS ALSO FAILED IN THIS CHALLENGING SCENARIO. HERE, IT
utt_0044 utt 303.16 309.15 -X WE FOUND USERS OF NEAREST NEIGHBORS PERFORMED SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER THAN ALL OTHER METHODS
utt_0046 utt 315.39 320.35 -X WHO ARE MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCHERS FAMILIAR WITH ATTRIBUTION METHODS AND NEAREST NEIGHBORS.
utt_0047 utt 320.47 325.63 -X INTERESTINGLY, EXPERTS ALSO FOUND NEAREST NEIGHBORS TO BE BETTER THAN GRADCAM.
utt_0054 utt 349.73 352.29 -X INTERESTINGLY, HUMANS CAN STILL MAKE A LOT OF CORRECT DECISIONS
utt_0059 utt 370.56 374.34 -6.3404 RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF), KAIST, AND AUBURN UNIVERSITY.
