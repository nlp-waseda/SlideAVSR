utt_0000 utt 0.06 6.86 -X J: WELCOME TO NATURAL QUESTIONS, THE HOT NEW GAME SHOW WHERE QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEMS ARE EVALUATED ON GOOGLE QUERIES.
utt_0002 utt 6.86 8.91 -X I’M YOUR HOST, EXACT MATCH!
utt_0003 utt 8.91 14.99 -X LET’S START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION: “WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF APPLE?”
utt_0004 utt 15.02 16.85 -X DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER, CONTESTANT one?
utt_0005 utt 16.85 19.03 -X B: TIM COOK J: WRONG!
utt_0007 utt 24.53 25.87 -X J: WRONG!
utt_0008 utt 26.13 28.82 -X HOW ABOUT YOU, CONTESTANT eight hundred and eighty-eight?
utt_0009 utt 28.82 31.92 -X C: TIMOTHY DONALD COOK J: AND THAT’S CORRECT!
utt_0010 utt 33.07 36.82 -X B: BUT TIM COOK AND TIMOTHY DONALD COOK ARE THE SAME PERSON!
utt_0011 utt 36.82 38.74 -X J: I’M SORRY, BUT THAT’S NOT WHAT I HAVE HERE.
utt_0013 utt 40.95 53.52 -X C: THIS IS AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE FROM THE WIDELY-USED NATURAL QUESTIONS DATASET, WHERE YOUR MODEL GIVES A CORRECT ANSWER, BUT DOESN’T EARN THE POINTS, BECAUSE THE GOLD ANSWER ANNOTATION
utt_0015 utt 53.52 55.96 -X DOES NOT CONSIDER EQUIVALENT ANSWERS.
utt_0016 utt 56.59 60.98 -X TO IMPROVE THIS SITUATION, WE INTRODUCE OUR WORK - ‘WHAT’S IN A NAME?
utt_0017 utt 60.98 63.25 -X ANSWER EQUIVALENCE FOR OPEN-DOMAIN QUESTION ANSWERING’.
utt_0018 utt 63.25 72.85 -X AS YOU CAN SEE FROM OUR INTRODUCTION, MOST QA DATASETS, SUCH AS NATURAL QUESTIONS AND SQUAD, ASSUME THAT THERE IS A SINGLE GOLD ANSWER TO EACH QUESTION.
utt_0020 utt 72.85 80.31 -X NOTE THAT TRIVIQA ALSO RELEASED A SET OF ALIASES FOR THE GOLD ANSWER, WHICH WE WILL USE LATER IN OUR AUGMENTED TRAINING AND EVALUATION.
utt_0022 utt 80.31 86.04 -X AS A RESULT, MODEL PREDICTIONS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT SURFACE FORMS BUT REFER TO THE SAME ENTITY,
utt_0023 utt 86.04 88.63 -X ARE CONSIDERED WRONG DURING EVALUATION.
utt_0024 utt 88.63 98.36 -X OUR IDEA IS QUITE SIMPLE: WE’RE GOING TO FIND ALTERNATE WAYS OF REFERRING TO AN ANSWER (SO “TIM COOK” JOINS “TIMOTHY DONALD COOK”) AND ADD THEM TO THE SET OF ACCEPTABLE ANSWERS!
utt_0027 utt 98.36 101.56 -X WE DO THIS ON THREE DATASETS: NATURAL QUESTIONS, SQUAD, AND TRIVIAQA.
utt_0028 utt 101.56 107.80 -X BEFORE WE CAN TELL YOU HOW WE ADD IN ALIASES, WE FIRST HAVE TO DO A BRIEF REFRESHER ON THE OPEN-DOMAIN QA PIPELINE.
utt_0030 utt 107.92 112.63 -X THEY ANSWER QUESTIONS AS FOLLOWS: A QUESTION COMES IN, AND THEN A DENSE PASSAGE RETRIEVER
utt_0031 utt 112.72 120.28 -X TURNS THAT QUESTION INTO A VECTOR IN A VECTOR SPACE THAT IS ALSO HOME TO PASSAGES THAT COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION.
utt_0033 utt 120.28 126.07 -X A BERT-BASED MODEL THEN ENCODES BOTH THE QUESTION AND PASSAGE, AND WE TAKE THE CLOSEST PASSAGE AS OUR ANSWER.
utt_0035 utt 126.07 130.07 -X WE APPLY SPAN SELECTION TO FIND THE SNIPPET OF THE PASSAGE TO EXTRACT THE ANSWER.
utt_0036 utt 130.23 135.58 -X SPAN SELECTION IS TRAINED TO HIGHLIGHT THE RIGHT ANSWER TO EXTRACT BASED ON TRAINING DATA.
utt_0038 utt 136.44 141.95 -X SO EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE MANY WAYS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION, ONLY ONE OF THESE IS VIEWED AS CORRECT.
utt_0040 utt 143.06 149.37 -X THIS SPAN, WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY EQUIVALENT, IS AS WRONG AS THIS SPAN TO THE TRAINING ALGORITHM.
utt_0041 utt 149.37 151.55 -X LET’S SEE HOW WE CAN FIX THIS WITH ANSWER ALIASES.
utt_0042 utt 151.55 155.29 -X FOR ANSWER EXPANSION, WE LOOK UP THE ORIGINAL ANSWER IN FREEBASE.
utt_0043 utt 155.58 160.57 -X FOR EXAMPLE, FOR THE ANSWER ENTITY SUN LIFE STADIUM, WE EXTRACT THE FOLLOWING ALIASES:
utt_0045 utt 164.64 167.68 -X WE CAN ADD ALL OF THEM INTO THE ANSWER SET.
utt_0046 utt 167.68 171.36 -X THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR EXPANDED ANSWER SET.
utt_0047 utt 171.36 177.21 -X THE EASIEST THING IS TO JUST RE-EVALUATED TRAINED QA MODELS ON THE EXPANDED ANSWER SETS.
utt_0048 utt 177.43 186.05 -X SPECIFICALLY, WE COMPUTE THE EXACT MATCH SCORE OF THE MODEL PREDICTION WITH RESPECT TO EVERY GOLD ANSWER IN THE ANSWER SET AND REPORT THE HIGHEST EM SCORE.
utt_0050 utt 186.05 187.77 -X BUT WE CAN ALSO USE THIS DURING TRAINING!
utt_0051 utt 187.77 196.64 -X WHEN WE INCORPORATE THE ALIAS ENTITIES IN TRAINING, WE TREAT EACH RETRIEVED PASSAGE AS POSITIVE IF IT CONTAINS EITHER THE ORIGINAL ANSWER OR THE EXTRACTED ALIAS ENTITIES.
utt_0053 utt 196.64 201.12 -X AS A RESULT, SOME ORIGINALLY NEGATIVE PASSAGES BECOME POSITIVE SINCE THEY MAY CONTAIN THE ALIASES.
utt_0055 utt 201.12 204.77 -X THEN, WE TRAIN ON THIS AUGMENTED TRAINING SET IN THE STANDARD QA PIPELINE.
utt_0056 utt 204.77 206.75 -X NOW, LET’S SEE IF THIS ACTUALLY HELPS!
utt_0057 utt 206.75 208.29 -X FIRST, HOW MANY NEW ANSWERS DO WE HAVE?
utt_0058 utt 208.29 212.80 -X QUITE A FEW MORE, ESPECIALLY ON NQ AND TRIVIAQA WHERE MOST ANSWERS ARE ENTITIES.
utt_0059 utt 212.80 216.38 -X FOR NQ, IT INCREASES FROM one point seven four TO thirteen point zero four, FOR TRIVIAQA IT INCREASES FROM one TO one4.03.
utt_0060 utt 216.38 219.55 -X AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE QUESTIONS ALSO INCREASES FOR ALL DATASETS.
utt_0061 utt 219.55 227.97 -X AS A RESULT OF THE ANSWER EXPANSION, SOME QUESTIONS ALREADY DON’T HAVE PASSAGES CONTAINING ANY ANSWER SPANS NOW HAVE SUCH MATCHES.
utt_0063 utt 227.97 233.19 -X WE CAN SEE AN INCREASE IN SUCH NEW POSITIVE QUESTIONS IN THE LAST TWO ROWS IN THE TABLE.
utt_0064 utt 233.19 238.27 -X LET’S FIRST SHOW WHAT HAPPENS TO ACCURACY WHEN YOU ADD MORE ANSWERS TO THE CORRECT SET.
utt_0065 utt 238.27 245.15 -X FOR REFERENCE, HERE’S WHAT ACCURACY LOOKS LIKE WITH CONVENTIONAL EVALUATION: WHEREVER ANSWERS ARE THERE FROM THE DATASET.
utt_0067 utt 245.15 249.67 -X EXACT MATCH INCREASES AS WE INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE ANSWER SET.
utt_0068 utt 249.67 251.14 -X BUT THIS SHOULDN’T SURPRISE YOU!
utt_0069 utt 251.14 255.65 -X WE COULD GET PERFECT ACCURACY BY ENUMERATING ALL FINITE STRINGS AND ADDING THEM TO THE ANSWER SET.
utt_0071 utt 255.65 262.50 -X WE THINK THAT WE’RE ADDING REASONABLE THINGS TO THE ANSWER SET, BUT LET’S SEE HOW THIS AFFECTS A TRAINED MODEL.
utt_0074 utt 265.54 269.57 -X IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS UNFAIR TO OUR APPROACH IF YOU AGREE THAT OUR ANSWERS ARE REASONABLE.
utt_0075 utt 269.57 278.31 -X BUT EVEN WITH THE CARDS STACKED AGAINST US, AUGMENTED TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES MODEL PERFORMANCE ON NQ, IMPROVES A LITTLE BIT FOR TRIVIAQA, BUT DECREASES ON SQUAD.
utt_0078 utt 278.79 284.58 -X YOU CAN GET A REASONABLE JUMP IN NQ ACCURACY JUST BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOME THINGS HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES.
utt_0080 utt 284.58 289.93 -X NOW THAT WE’VE GONE THROUGH THE NUMBERS, LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME EXAMPLES TO SEE WHAT’S ACTUALLY GOING ON.
utt_0082 utt 289.93 297.89 -X WE TAKE A LOOK AT TRAINING PASSAGES THAT DIDN’T HAVE A CORRECT ANSWER BUT NOW HAVE A CORRECT ANSWER SPAN FROM THE AUGMENTED ANSWER SET.
utt_0084 utt 297.89 302.02 -X WHILE MOST EXAMPLES ARE VALID, WE IDENTIFY SOME EXAMPLES THAT ARE NOT VALID.
utt_0085 utt 302.02 303.72 -X AND HERE ARE THE EXAMPLES.
utt_0086 utt 303.72 309.26 -X FOR THE FIRST EXAMPLE, THE ALIAS FRANCE IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AT THE GOLD ANSWER PARIS.
utt_0087 utt 309.38 315.50 -X FOR THE SECOND EXAMPLE, THE CONTEXT FROM WHICH THE ALIAS IS FROM, IS NOT REALLY ANSWERING THE QUESTION.
utt_0089 utt 315.50 321.90 -X FOR THE LAST EXAMPLE, THE QUESTION IS ASKING FOR A SPECIFIC ALIAS, WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ALIAS IN THE ANSWER SET.
utt_0091 utt 321.90 327.14 -X AFTER EXAMINING fifty RANDOMLY SAMPLED QUESTIONS, WE CLASSIFY THEM INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: CORRECT,
utt_0092 utt 327.14 333.29 -X DEBATABLE, AND WRONG ANSWERS, AS WELL AS INVALID QUESTIONS THAT ARE ILL-FORMED OR UNANSWERABLE DUE TO ANNOTATION ERROR.
utt_0096 utt 336.97 344.01 -X HOWEVER, AUGMENTATION OFTEN SURFACES WRONG AUGMENTED ANSWERS FOR SQUAD, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THE EM SCORE DROPS WITH AUGMENTED TRAINING.
utt_0098 utt 344.01 348.68 -X AND WE ALSO SHOW THE BREAKDOWN OF THE WRONG AUGMENTATION TYPES IN THE TABLE.
utt_0099 utt 348.68 354.41 -X AND WE FURTHER BREAKDOWN THE WRONG AUGMENTATION INTO THREE TYPES: (one) NON- EQUIVALENT ENTITIES,
utt_0100 utt 354.41 363.02 -X WHERE THE UNDERLYING KNOWLEDGE BASE HAS A MISTAKE, WHICH IS RARE IN HIGH QUALITY KBS (two) WRONG CONTEXT, WHERE THE CORRE- SPONDING CONTEXT IS NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION (three)
utt_0102 utt 363.50 370.48 -X WRONG ALIAS, WHERE THE QUESTION ASKS ABOUT SPECIFIC ALTERNATE FORMS OF AN ENTITY BUT THE PREDICTION IS AN- OTHER ALIAS OF THE ENTITY.
utt_0104 utt 370.48 371.44 -X THIS IS MORE COMMON IN SQUAD.
utt_0105 utt 371.44 375.12 -X YOU CAN ALSO REFER TO THE EXAMPLES HERE IN THIS TABLE (SLIDE - TABLE six).
utt_0106 utt 375.12 381.68 -X NEXT, WE SAMPLE FIFTY TEST EXAMPLES THAT MODELS GET WRONG UNDER THE ORIGINAL EVALUATION BUT THAT ARE CORRECT UNDER AUGMENTED EVALUATION.
utt_0109 utt 386.77 390.80 -X THIS SUGGESTS THAT OUR AUGMENTED EVALUATION IS INDEED RELIABLE.
utt_0110 utt 391.31 400.08 -X SO, IN SUMMARY, OUR WORK EXPLORES THE IDEA OF INCORPORATING ALIAS ANSWERS IN BOTH MODEL EVALUATION AND TRAINING, AND OBSERVED POSITIVE RESULTS.
utt_0112 utt 400.20 406.64 -X THAT BEING SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE, ESPECIALLY FOR ANSWERS THAT ARE NOT ENTITIES.
