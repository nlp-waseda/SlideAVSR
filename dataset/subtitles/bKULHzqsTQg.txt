utt_0000 utt 0.24 6.58 -X HI I'M TICHA SETHAPAKDI AND TODAY I WILL TALK ABOUT OUR SYSTEM FOR DESIGNING AND FABRICATING POLARIZED LIGHT MOSAICS
utt_0010 utt 41.90 47.76 -X YOU CAN MAKE ONE YOURSELF BY SANDWICHING PIECES OF THE BIREFRINGENT MATERIAL BETWEEN TWO POLARIZERS
utt_0011 utt 48.40 55.09 -X BUT WHAT'S MOST COMPELLING ABOUT POLARIZED LIGHT MOSAICS IS THE EASE WHICH WHICH YOU CAN CREATE COLOR CHANGING EFFECTS
utt_0013 utt 55.15 59.49 -X FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE EFFECT HERE BY ROTATING THE IMAGE LAYER
utt_0014 utt 60.21 64.15 -X AND YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE EFFECT HERE BY ROTATING ONE OF THE POLARIZERS
utt_0015 utt 65.84 68.02 -X HOWEVER, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE,
utt_0018 utt 77.65 82.65 -X TO EXPERIMENTATION BEFORE THEY KNOW WHAT COLORS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OR WHAT EFFECTS ARE FEASIBLE
utt_0019 utt 83.31 86.55 -X IN PRACTICE, VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EXPLORED THIS MEDIUM IN
utt_0021 utt 90.42 101.27 -X THIS VIDEO SHOWS A MASTER POLARIZED LIGHT MOSAICIST AT WORK AND YOU CAN SEE HOW IT'S QUITE AN INTRICATE PROCESS SO TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES AND LOWER THE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR MAKING
utt_0024 utt 101.27 109.88 -X POLARIZED LIGHT MOSAICS, WE BUILT AN END-TO-END SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS USERS TO DESIGN AND FABRICATE THESE MOSAICS WITH CUSTOM COLOR-CHANGING BEHAVIORS
utt_0026 utt 110.36 115.96 -X IN THIS WORK, WE FORMALIZE THE SET OF MOSAIC CONSTRUCTIONS AND THE COLOR CHANGING EFFECTS ENABLED BY THEM
utt_0028 utt 116.05 123.72 -X I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THEM TODAY, BUT I JUST WANTED TO GO THROUGH THE BASIC WORKING PRINCIPLE AND THE MOST ARCHETYPAL EXAMPLES
utt_0030 utt 124.47 130.17 -X THE MOST BASIC MOSAIC USES A SINGLE LAYER OF CELLOPHANE SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO POLARIZERS,
utt_0031 utt 130.17 132.33 -X WHICH RESULTS IN A SINGLE COLORED DESIGN
utt_0032 utt 132.53 137.10 -X FOR CLARITY, WE USE THE TERM ANALYZER TO REFER TO THE TOPMOST POLARIZER
utt_0033 utt 137.37 141.50 -X WHEN BOTH POLARIZERS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE CELLOPHANE STRAIN DIRECTION,
utt_0034 utt 141.50 147.10 -X THE MOSAIC WILL APPEAR COLORLESS, AND AT forty-five DEGREES IT REACHES MAXIMUM SATURATION
utt_0035 utt 147.25 152.12 -X THE MOSAIC ALTERNATES BETWEEN COVERED AND COLORLESS AT forty-five DEGREE INCREMENTS
utt_0036 utt 152.57 163.36 -X SINCE THE OPACITY OF THE MOSAIC DEPENDS ON ITS ANGLE RELATIVE TO THE POLARIZERS, YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT BY EITHER ROTATING THE MOSAIC OR ROTATING BOTH POLARIZERS AT THE SAME TIME
utt_0038 utt 164.76 170.36 -X THE ORIENTATION OF THE POLARIZERS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER ALSO AFFECTS THE APPEARANCE OF THE DESIGN
utt_0040 utt 170.87 175.31 -X COLORS UNDER PARALLEL AND ORTHOGONAL POLARIZERS ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER
utt_0041 utt 175.48 180.45 -X NOTICE HOW THE BACKGROUND CHANGES TO BLACK WHEN THE POLARIZERS ARE ORTHOGONAL TO EACH OTHER
utt_0042 utt 180.73 187.01 -X THIS IS BECAUSE THE ORTHOGONAL POLARIZERS BLOCK LIGHT WHILE PARALLEL POLARIZERS LET LIGHT PASS THROUGH
utt_0044 utt 188.95 195.42 -X WE CAN CREATE MULTI-COLORED DESIGNS BY STACKING MULTIPLE PIECES OF CELLOPHANE TOGETHER AND THEN ARRANGING THEM TO FORM AN IMAGE
utt_0046 utt 195.55 198.30 -X THE AFOREMENTIONED COLOR EFFECTS WORK IN THE SAME WAY
utt_0047 utt 200.47 204.22 -X WHAT HAPPENS IF WE WANTED TO FADE TWO MOSAICS INTO EACH OTHER?
utt_0048 utt 204.22 209.18 -X RECALL THAT MOSAICS ARE COLORLESS AT zero DEGREE ROTATIONS AND REACH FULL SATURATION
utt_0049 utt 209.44 212.48 -X AT forty-five DEGREE ROTATIONS RELATIVE TO THE POLARIZERS
utt_0050 utt 212.76 216.74 -X BY POSITIONING THE MOSAICS AT A forty-five DEGREE OFFSET TO EACH OTHER,
utt_0051 utt 216.74 227.58 -X WE ENSURE THAT ONE MOSAIC IS FULLY SATURATED ONLY WHEN THE OTHER IS FULLY COLORLESS THE LAST EFFECT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS MASKING
utt_0053 utt 228.12 233.49 -X THE MASK IS JUST A THIRD POLARIZER THAT IS INSERTED BETWEEN THE TOPMOST MOSAIC AND ANALYZER
utt_0054 utt 233.50 237.46 -X ITS VISIBILITY DEPENDS ON ITS ALIGNMENT RELATIVE TO THE ANALYZER
utt_0055 utt 237.76 248.48 -X REMEMBER THAT POLARIZERS WILL BLOCK LIGHT WHEN THEY ARE ORTHOGONAL TO EACH OTHER: THUS, THE MASK IS FULLY OPAQUE WHEN IT IS ORTHOGONAL TO THE ANALYZER AND TRANSPARENT WHEN THEY ARE PARALLEL
utt_0057 utt 250.85 254.40 -X NOW THAT YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIC COLOR-CHANGING EFFECTS,
utt_0058 utt 254.40 266.76 -X HERE IS A BRIEF WALKTHROUGH OF HOW A DESIGNER MIGHT USE OUR SYSTEM TO CREATE A MOSAIC UPON STARTUP, POLAGON STUDIO SHOWS USERS DESIGN TEMPLATES BASED ON THE FOUR CORE POLYGON CONSTRUCTIONS
utt_0061 utt 267.30 271.43 -X THE TEMPLATE THAT THE USER PICKS DETERMINES THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR FINAL DESIGN
utt_0062 utt 272.03 277.09 -X SO IN THIS CASE, THE USER IS PICKING A DOUBLE MOSAIC AND MASK CONSTRUCTION
utt_0063 utt 277.86 280.23 -X ONCE USERS SELECT A DESIGN TEMPLATE,
utt_0064 utt 280.23 289.96 -X POLAGON STUDIO LOADS THE TEMPLATE FILES INTO THE MAIN WINDOW USERS CAN THEN MODIFY THE EXISTING TEMPLATE FILES OR LOAD CUSTOM DESIGNS INTO THE INTERFACE
utt_0066 utt 291.30 303.85 -X SO IN THIS CASE, THE USER IS REPLACING THE TEMPLATE DESIGN WITH ONE THAT THEY MADE WHEN THE USER IMPORTS THEIR DESIGN, THE INTERFACE MAPS THE COLORS IN THE DESIGN TO THE CLOSEST MATCHING COLORS UNDER ALIGNED POLARIZERS
utt_0069 utt 305.83 313.35 -X IN THIS SCREEN, THE USER CAN EXPLORE THE AVAILABLE COLOR PALETTE BASED ON THEIR SUPPLY OF CELLOPHANE AND ADJUST THE COLORS IN THEIR MOSAIC
utt_0071 utt 314.47 321.91 -X HOVERING OVER A SWATCH IN THE AVAILABLE COLOR PALETTE SHOWS A TOOL TIP THAT SHOWS THE QUANTITY AND THE TYPES OF CELLOPHANE THAT THE COLOR IS MADE FROM
utt_0073 utt 323.01 328.10 -X THE USER CAN ALSO SWITCH BETWEEN USING THE COLORS UNDER ALIGNED OR ORTHOGONAL POLARIZERS,
utt_0074 utt 328.16 331.88 -X AS WELL AS FILTER COLORS IF THEY WANT TO WORK WITH A MORE RESTRICTED PALETTE
utt_0075 utt 336.55 339.37 -X THEY CAN ALSO CHANGE SPECIFIC COLOR ASSIGNMENTS
utt_0076 utt 341.13 355.15 -X IF THEY ARE SATISFIED WITH THE COLORS IN THEIR NEW DESIGN, THE MAIN WINDOW IS UPDATED ACCORDINGLY WE ALSO PROVIDE AN INTERACTIVE MODE WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO BUILD INTUITION ON THE COLOR-CHANGING EFFECTS
utt_0079 utt 355.33 368.75 -X THE LEFT SIDE OF THE INTERACT WINDOW SHOWS THE MOSAIC DECOMPOSED INTO ITS CONSTITUENT COMPONENTS, REPRESENTED AS ADJUSTABLE KNOBS THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS THE EFFECT THAT THOSE ROTATIONS HAVE ON THE POLAGON'S APPEARANCE
