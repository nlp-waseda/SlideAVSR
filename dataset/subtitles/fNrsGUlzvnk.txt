utt_0000 utt 0.42 3.98 -X GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR HAVING ME FOR THIS WORKSHOP.
utt_0001 utt 3.98 7.50 -X I'LL JUMP RIGHT IN TO COVER WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
utt_0002 utt 7.50 20.78 -X TODAY I'M GOING TO FIRST POSITION INTERACTIVE LEARNING SYSTEM ON A TWO BY TWO MATRIX TO MAKE MY ARGUMENTS AND THEN DEVELOP A LIVE DEMO OF A SELF CALIBRATING INTERFACE, SHOW HOW IT WAS APPLIED TO BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE,
utt_0005 utt 20.78 25.09 -X AND THEN GO BACK TO MY POSITIONING TO EXPLAIN A FEW CHALLENGES I THINK
utt_0006 utt 25.39 28.72 -X MIGHT BE INTERESTING FOR THE COMMUNITY.
utt_0007 utt 28.78 35.70 -X SO MY POSITIONING START WITH ON THE X AXIS, ON THE SIDE, YOU HAVE AN INTERACTION SYSTEM WHERE THE USER HAS TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT.
utt_0009 utt 35.70 40.40 -X IT'S KIND OF, I WANT TO TEACH A MACHINE, BUT THE INTERFACE TO USE IT, I HAVE TO LEARN IT AS A USER.
utt_0011 utt 40.52 49.58 -X AND ON THE OTHER SIDE IS MORE, I START TEACHING THE MACHINE HOW I WANT, AND THE MACHINE HAS TO FIGURE OUT THE WAY I DECIDE TO INTERACT WITH THEM.
utt_0014 utt 52.40 53.65 -X DIFFERENT, AND SO YOU NEED TO LEARN.
utt_0015 utt 54.00 58.83 -X AND IN THE MIDDLE, THERE IS ALWAYS CO ADAPTATION, WHERE IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF A BIT OF BOTH.
utt_0017 utt 60.91 64.88 -X ON THE Y AXIS, I WANT TO HAVE A SCALE OF USABILITY IN TERMS OF TIMING.
utt_0018 utt 64.88 66.19 -X SO CAN I USE IT RIGHT NOW?
utt_0019 utt 66.19 67.92 -X CAN IT WORK LIKE RIGHT NOW?
utt_0020 utt 67.98 79.67 -X OR DO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS UNTIL WE KIND OF CONVERGE TO EITHER I DON'T HAVE TO USE IT AND IT TAKES ME SOME TIME OR THE MACHINE WANTS TO UNDERSTAND ME, BUT IT TAKES THE MACHINE SOME TIME.
utt_0023 utt 80.56 88.50 -X I'LL POSITION A FEW SYSTEMS, TRY TO UNDERSTAND, MAKE SOME SORT OF EXPERIMENTS TO JUSTIFY WHAT A SELF CALIBRATING INTERFACE MIGHT BE.
utt_0025 utt 90.19 96.18 -X SO SOME EXAMPLES ON THE TOP LEFT, YOU HAVE CLASSIC AN APP WHERE IT'S EASY TO USE.
utt_0026 utt 96.18 102.39 -X THE USER JUST LEARNS HOW TO, YOU KNOW, USE AN APP, BUT IT'S MADE TO BE USED IMMEDIATELY.
utt_0028 utt 102.39 106.16 -X IN THE MIDDLE, YOU HAVE SOMETHING A BIT MORE COMPLEX, LIKE A REMOTE CONTROL
utt_0030 utt 108.85 111.19 -X YOU NEED TO LEARN.
utt_0031 utt 111.19 115.95 -X AND THE EXTREME CASE IS LIKE A COCKPIT OF A PLANE WHERE YOU TAKE YEARS,
utt_0032 utt 115.95 119.22 -X LITERALLY YEARS, TO LEARN TO USE IT.
utt_0033 utt 119.22 122.39 -X ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE, SO THAT'S ALL THE USER HAS TO LEARN.
utt_0034 utt 122.96 136.37 -X ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE MACHINE HAS TO LEARN, YOU HAVE MORE LIKE A BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACE, WHERE IT'S VERY EASY TO DRIVE A WHEELCHAIR TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE WHEELCHAIR WORKS, BUT THE MACHINE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR BRAIN WORKS.
utt_0037 utt 136.37 138.74 -X IT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO...
utt_0038 utt 139.28 143.25 -X SAY TO HIM, GO FORWARDS OR GO BACKWARDS, AND THAT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU AND FOR ME.
utt_0039 utt 143.63 145.84 -X AND IT TAKES QUITE A LOT OF TIME TO CALIBRATE.
utt_0040 utt 145.84 147.44 -X SO WE'RE IN THAT CORNER.
utt_0041 utt 147.44 153.20 -X AND I WANT ALSO TO SPECIFY THAT NOT ALL MACHINE LEARNING IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE, RIGHT?
utt_0043 utt 153.20 158.00 -X ANY INTERFACE THAT HAS PRE TRAINED MACHINE LEARNING MODELS, THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED
utt_0044 utt 158.03 165.78 -X ON MILLIONS OF DATA OF EVERYONE AND USES LIKE SOMETHING WE HAVE AS A SHARED EXPERIENCE, LIKE LANGUAGE, LIKE ENGLISH.
utt_0046 utt 165.78 170.71 -X SO IF YOU TAKE AN ALEXA AND YOU SPEAK IN ENGLISH, EVERYBODY CAN USE IT, RIGHT?
utt_0047 utt 170.71 174.32 -X THERE IS NO NEED FOR THE MACHINE TO RELEARN HOW YOU SPECIFICALLY SPEAK.
utt_0048 utt 174.42 178.64 -X AND IF ANY, IF ANYTHING, YOU HAVE TO LEARN WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT KEYWORDS.
utt_0049 utt 178.64 183.54 -X SO THAT WOULD BE MORE ON THE LEFT SIDE AND WE CAN DEBATE THIS, BUT LET'S FOLLOW MY THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS HERE.
utt_0051 utt 184.69 187.57 -X AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO BE IN CO ADAPTATION A BIT IN THE MIDDLE.
utt_0052 utt 187.57 190.52 -X YOU KIND OF BRING ELEMENTS FROM WHAT WE'VE JUST FOUND.
utt_0053 utt 190.67 197.52 -X AND YOU HAVE EXAMPLE LIKE GLOVETALK THAT I KNOW WHICH, WHICH CAN BOTH STARTS FROM SCRATCH AND THEN ADAPTS TO THE USER.
utt_0055 utt 199.92 200.85 -X AND THAT'S IT.
utt_0056 utt 200.85 205.24 -X SO IF, IF, IF WE FOLLOW THIS LOGIC, WE CAN REACH ANYTHING WITHIN THIS TRIANGLE.
utt_0057 utt 205.24 217.08 -X AND I WANT TO GO A BIT DEEPER IN THAT TO SHOW THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF, AS AN ASSUMPTION I'M MAKING, THERE'S SOME SORT OF UNDERLYING IDEALITY OF HOW THIS SPACE LOOKS LIKE.
utt_0060 utt 217.08 222.90 -X SO IF WE TAKE A DEVICE LIKE THE TV AND A REMOTE CONTROL WITH BUTTONS, WE COULD DO SOME EXPERIMENTS, USER EXPERIMENTS.
utt_0062 utt 222.90 224.72 -X WE COULD GO AND SEE EXPERIMENTS AND ASK THEM.
utt_0063 utt 225.07 227.06 -X WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS DEVICE?
utt_0064 utt 227.06 229.30 -X SO WE BUILD ONE AND WE ASK THEM, IS IT, DO YOU LIKE IT?
utt_0065 utt 229.30 231.51 -X IS IT EFFICIENT OR IS IT HARD TO USE?
utt_0066 utt 231.86 236.95 -X ONE SUCH DEVICE COULD BE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH VERY SIMPLE, JUST DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AND A CONFIRM BUTTON.
utt_0068 utt 236.95 238.52 -X AND THEY'LL USE IT FOR A WHILE.
utt_0069 utt 238.52 242.48 -X IT WOULD BE REALLY EASY TO USE IMMEDIATELY, BUT IN TERMS OF POWER,
utt_0070 utt 242.80 248.63 -X IT WOULD BE LIMITED BECAUSE THERE IS SOME FUNCTION THAT WILL BE REALLY CUMBERSOME TO FIND AND USE.
utt_0072 utt 248.63 249.84 -X IT WOULD TAKE MANY CLICKS.
utt_0073 utt 250.42 258.29 -X ON THE OTHER EXTREME, YOU HAVE A REMOTE CONTROL WITH EVERY BUTTON POSSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THE TV CAN DO, AND THAT WOULD BE CUMBERSOME BECAUSE YOU'D HAVE
utt_0075 utt 258.35 261.24 -X A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE TO USE THIS.
utt_0076 utt 261.36 273.33 -X ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE, YOU'D HAVE A BLANK REMOTE CONTROL WHERE YOU'D BE ASKED TO TELL WHAT EVERY BUTTON IS SUPPOSED TO DO, SO IT COMES TOTALLY BLANK STATE AND YOU PROGRAM IT YOURSELF.
utt_0079 utt 273.33 278.61 -X THAT WOULD BE REALLY CUMBERSOME, OF COURSE, BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY START USING IT, BEFORE SOME TIME.
utt_0081 utt 278.61 282.17 -X AND ON THE TOP RIGHT IS SOMETHING A BIT MORE INVASIVE THAT WE ARE NOT USED TO.
utt_0082 utt 282.17 286.17 -X AND I HOPE TO SHOW YOU A DEMO OF WHAT THIS MIGHT BE, LATER TODAY.
utt_0083 utt 286.17 290.58 -X AND THAT WOULD BE A DEVICE WITH JUST TWO BUTTONS WHERE YOU JUST START USING IT.
utt_0084 utt 290.58 297.27 -X YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BUTTONS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT AS YOU USE IT, THE MACHINE LEARNS WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO AND KIND OF DOES IT.
utt_0086 utt 297.30 302.77 -X AND, AND, AND, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD ADAPT LIKE YOU AND ME WOULD HAVE THE SAME REMOTE, BUT IT WOULD NOT WORK THE SAME WAY.
utt_0088 utt 302.77 306.20 -X IF I TAKE YOUR REMOTE, I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE IT'S TAILORED TO YOU.
utt_0089 utt 306.20 317.72 -X AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NORMAL REMOTE, WHICH IS WHAT, YOU KNOW, DESIGNERS HAVE CONVERGED WITH, AND IT'S, IT'S MORE EFFICIENT BECAUSE IT'S A BIT OF, OF MIX OF THE, YOU HAVE SOME QUICK BUTTON, ACCESS BUTTON, AND SOME, BUTTONS YOU
utt_0092 utt 317.72 326.93 -X CAN PROGRAM MAYBE, AND, AND SOME OF THEM ARE MORE TAILORED TO WHAT PEOPLE DO MOST OF THE TIME, JUST HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED AND PEOPLE LIKE IT BETTER.
utt_0094 utt 326.93 337.17 -X AND SO IF YOU FOLLOW THAT, WE COULD MAYBE BUILD ALL THESE MILLIONS OF DEVICES THAT ARE FINE GRAINED INTO THE SCALE, DO THE EXPERIMENTS, AND HAVE AN IDEALITY MAP UNDERNEATH, RIGHT?
utt_0097 utt 337.17 343.19 -X AND THEN THERE IS QUESTIONS LIKE, DOES AN OPTIMAL MAPPING EXIST, RIGHT?
utt_0098 utt 343.19 346.01 -X IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO BE USING?
utt_0099 utt 346.01 351.83 -X I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO, BUT WHAT, WHAT MOST STARTUP PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT IT'S TOP LEFT CORNER.
utt_0101 utt 353.23 356.41 -X LIKE, YOU WANT SOMETHING FIXED THAT USER CAN LEARN IMMEDIATELY.
utt_0102 utt 356.41 360.41 -X AND IS VERY EFFICIENT AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE TARGET CONVENIENCE CORNER.
utt_0103 utt 360.41 363.22 -X AND I THINK IT'S NICE, IT'S A NICE TARGET TO GET WHEN IT'S FEASIBLE.
utt_0104 utt 363.22 370.49 -X I DON'T THINK IT'S ALWAYS FEASIBLE, BUT I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY ONLY WORKING FOR MODALITIES THAT WE ARE CONSCIOUSLY IN CONTROL, RIGHT.
utt_0106 utt 370.49 372.18 -X THAT ARE EXPLICIT.
utt_0107 utt 372.18 380.73 -X AND WE GO TO THE IMPLICIT PART JUST NOW, ESPECIALLY SPEECH OR TOUCH OR GESTURES WHERE IF I, IF YOU ASK ME TO WAVE, I KNOW HOW TO WAVE.
utt_0109 utt 380.73 383.32 -X IF YOU ASK ME TO SAY HELLO, I KNOW HOW TO SAY HELLO.
utt_0110 utt 383.32 386.62 -X I DON'T HAVE TO LEARN HOW DO IT, AND I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
utt_0111 utt 386.87 390.04 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE INTERFACES LIKE NEURAL INTERFACES.
utt_0112 utt 390.04 393.43 -X THAT'S ONE SUB SAMPLE OF INTERFACE WE DON'T KNOW, RIGHT?
utt_0113 utt 393.43 396.44 -X IF YOU ASK ME TO GENERATE SPECIFIC SPIKES ON SPECIFIC NEURONS,
utt_0114 utt 396.44 397.94 -X I WON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.
utt_0115 utt 397.94 402.97 -X OR SPECIFIC PATTERNS ON MY, MUSCLES INPUTS, I WON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT EXACTLY.
utt_0116 utt 403.70 408.82 -X AND THOSE ARE CASES WHERE, I DO THINK THE UNDERLYING IDEALITY MAP IS MORE LIKE THIS.
utt_0117 utt 409.01 413.91 -X IT'S MORE LIKE, OBVIOUSLY YOU WANT IT AS YOU CAN, HIGHER UP AS YOU CAN, SO YOU CAN USE IT QUICKLY.
utt_0119 utt 414.68 418.01 -X BUT YOU DO NEED TO ADAPT TO EVERY PERSON, BECAUSE EVERY PERSON IS DIFFERENT.
utt_0120 utt 418.01 424.89 -X AND YOU ALSO DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE IT SOMEHOW OUT OF THE BOX, SO THE USER STILL NEEDS TO KIND OF LEARN HOW TO USE IT.
utt_0122 utt 425.24 430.62 -X SO WE ARE MORE THERE, AND OF COURSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE MORE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT EXISTS.
utt_0124 utt 431.22 433.82 -X AND THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE, RIGHT?
utt_0125 utt 433.82 435.35 -X HOW DO WE GET TO THIS?
utt_0126 utt 435.44 439.99 -X SOME ANSWERS ARE LIKE WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON IS PRE TRAINED AVERAGE DECODERS.
utt_0128 utt 440.37 448.06 -X YOU LEARN SOME SORT OF AVERAGE BASE DECODER THAT WORKS FOR ON AVERAGE DATA YOU COLLECTED ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.
utt_0130 utt 448.06 454.33 -X YOU TRAIN A DECODER AND THEN YOU FINE TUNE FOR THAT SPECIFIC PERSON THROUGH MAYBE AN ONBOARDING STAGE.
utt_0132 utt 454.42 455.42 -X THAT WORKS.
utt_0133 utt 455.42 456.06 -X OKAY.
utt_0134 utt 456.06 456.86 -X THAT WORKS QUITE WELL.
utt_0135 utt 456.86 466.17 -X BUT THE QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, AS A SCIENTIST, AS A CURIOUS PERSON, HOW CAN WE GO FURTHER THAN THIS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE PRE TRAINING JUST WON'T WORK, RIGHT?
utt_0137 utt 466.17 468.25 -X JUST SOME PEOPLE HAVE OPPOSITE WAY TO USE IT.
utt_0138 utt 468.25 477.05 -X PEOPLE USE THE MOUSE SCROLLING UP TO GO DOWN OR DOWN TO GO UP OR, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE JUST INHERENTLY DIFFERENT WAYS TO APPROACH PROBLEMS.
utt_0140 utt 477.81 485.95 -X AND THE QUESTION THEN IS, WHERE IS THIS, WHERE IS THIS OTHER CORNERS THAT HAVE NOT TOUCH YET AND I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER OF WHAT THAT IS.
utt_0142 utt 485.95 487.13 -X I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR EXAMPLE.
utt_0143 utt 487.61 495.55 -X BUT I KNOW THAT FROM WORK I'VE DONE AND WORK I'VE SEEN, THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME SORT OF MEASURE OF USER'S INTERNAL CONSISTENCY.
utt_0145 utt 496.41 503.13 -X AND THAT MEANS THAT, ONE DEFINITION THAT YOU COULD THINK OF IS THAT USERS PERFORM SIMILAR ACTIONS TO MEAN SIMILAR THINGS.
utt_0147 utt 503.13 506.71 -X THEY ARE SOMEHOW INTERNALLY CONSISTENT WITH THEMSELVES.
utt_0148 utt 506.71 511.16 -X LIKE THEY HAVE A MENTAL MODEL OF WHAT TO DO AND THEY DO IT IN REPETITION.
utt_0149 utt 511.51 517.72 -X AND ANOTHER DEFINITION OF CONSISTENCY IS BY DEFINING THE OPPOSITE OF LIKE BEING A LACK OF CONTRADICTION.
utt_0151 utt 517.72 521.37 -X LIKE USERS MORE LIKELY WON'T CONTRADICT THEMSELVES.
utt_0152 utt 521.37 522.84 -X THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DEBATED.
utt_0153 utt 522.84 525.56 -X AND I KNOW WE HAVE INTERESTING TALKS TODAY ON THIS TOPIC.
utt_0154 utt 525.85 531.71 -X BUT, BUT I, I WANT TO STICK WITH THAT FOR A MINUTE AND SHOW YOU HOW THIS HAS BEEN PUT TO USE RECENTLY IN DIFFERENT WORKS.
utt_0156 utt 531.71 534.33 -X AND I SELECTED FOUR WORKS THAT I'VE PUT IN THE CORNER.
utt_0157 utt 534.33 536.47 -X THEY'RE ALL REALLY ON THE SAME SPIRIT.
utt_0158 utt 536.47 538.33 -X FIRST ONE IS CALLED FIRST CONTACT.
utt_0159 utt 538.33 541.21 -X IT'S BEEN LAST YEAR IN RIPS.
utt_0160 utt 542.01 546.55 -X AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY, THEY REALLY TRIED TO CONTROL A ROVER WITH YOUR HANDS.
utt_0161 utt 546.55 550.04 -X SO YOU HAVE A CONTROLLER BETWEEN HOW YOU MOVE YOUR HANDS AND HOW THIS ROVER MOVES.
utt_0162 utt 550.04 556.25 -X AND THEY EVOLVED THIS CONTROLLER, BUT WITHOUT A REWARD FUNCTION THAT IS EXPLICIT ON THE TASK, RIGHT?
utt_0164 utt 556.25 559.61 -X WITHOUT SAYING, WE'RE GOING TO EVOLVE THE BEST CONTROLLER SO THE LANDER DOESN'T CRASH NOW.
utt_0166 utt 559.61 563.77 -X THEY SAID, WE'RE GOING TO EVOLVE THE BEST CONTROLLER SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAXIMIZE
utt_0167 utt 563.93 569.71 -X MUTUAL INFORMATION BETWEEN MOVEMENT THAT THE USER IS DOING AND THE KIND OF
utt_0168 utt 569.91 572.41 -X STATE TRANSITION MOVEMENT OF THIS ROVER.
utt_0169 utt 572.95 581.75 -X AND THAT IS TO SAY THAT IF I'M DOING, IF THE ROVER IS BEHAVING LIKE I WANT IT TO DO, I'M GOING TO ACT CONSISTENTLY WITH IT, RIGHT?
utt_0171 utt 581.75 585.27 -X LIKE WHEN I DO SOMETHING, I WON'T KEEP JUST CHANGING ALL THE TIME WHAT I'M DOING,
utt_0172 utt 585.27 587.16 -X BECAUSE IT WILL DO WHAT I EXPECT IT TO DO.
utt_0173 utt 587.41 591.03 -X AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY DID THAT AND IT WORKED, LIKE THEY DID
utt_0174 utt 591.41 593.56 -X HAVE TO GIVE THEM A TASK TO TEST.
utt_0175 utt 593.56 599.16 -X BUT IT WAS NOT INCENTIVIZED ON THAT TASK AND THEY COULD SUCCESSFULLY LAND THE ROVER.
utt_0177 utt 600.18 604.83 -X ABOUT fifty% OF THE TIME, WHICH IS GREAT IMPROVEMENT FROM BASELINE.
utt_0178 utt 604.83 607.13 -X SECOND WORK IS THE ARCHITECT BUILDER PROBLEM.
utt_0179 utt 608.06 612.83 -X two thousand and twenty-one THAT I THINK HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ALSO ICML OR ANOTHER SIMILAR CONFERENCE.
utt_0180 utt 612.83 615.36 -X WHERE YOU HAVE AN ARCHITECT AND A BUILDER.
utt_0181 utt 615.74 617.85 -X AND THERE'S A KIND OF SIMULATED BOTH SIDES.
utt_0182 utt 617.85 622.81 -X YOU HAVE THE TEACHER AND THE LEARNER IN THE ROOM, BUT THEY ONLY CAN COMMUNICATE THROUGH UNKNOWN SIGNALS, RIGHT?
utt_0184 utt 622.81 625.68 -X SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SIGNAL MEANS AND ALL THEY COULD RELY ON
utt_0185 utt 626.07 628.03 -X SOME SORT OF OTHER METRICS LIKE.
utt_0186 utt 628.38 630.30 -X SOME SORT OF INTERNAL CONSISTENCY.
utt_0187 utt 630.30 633.15 -X IT'S HARD TO ANALYZE WHAT WAS GOING ON, BECAUSE IT WAS A SETUP THAT WAS,
utt_0188 utt 633.82 637.44 -X UNSCIENTIFIZED, AT A LEVEL THAT, THAT, THAT'S NOT THAT EXPLICIT.
utt_0189 utt 637.44 650.24 -X BUT, IF YOU GO AND LOOK INTO THE SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS, THEY HAVE A FIGURE THAT SHOWS EVOLUTION OF MUTUAL INFORMATION, AND THE OBSERVATIONS THAT MUTUAL INFORMATION INCREASES, WHICH MAKES SENSE, BUT THAT COULD HAVE
utt_0192 utt 650.24 654.14 -X BEEN THE TARGET, MAYBE, OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING, LIKE THE OTHER WORK DID.
utt_0193 utt 654.42 659.90 -X THEN WE HAVE INTERACTION GROUNDED LEARNING, WHICH IS A WORK FROM MICROSOFT RESEARCH.
utt_0195 utt 659.90 664.51 -X AND I THINK PAUL IS TALKING TODAY, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN THIS, FURTHER.
utt_0196 utt 665.69 668.99 -X I'LL BE HONEST THAT IT'S VERY TECHNICAL PAPER, A LOT OF MATH.
utt_0197 utt 669.75 671.45 -X I DO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON.
utt_0198 utt 671.45 677.47 -X SO YOU HAVE A TASK THAT IS, YOU HAVE A NUMBER, YOU THINK OF A NUMBER, WE SHOW YOU A NUMBER AND WE WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S A NUMBER YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT.
utt_0200 utt 677.47 683.74 -X AND, AND, AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN IT'S NOT THE NUMBER YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT, THERE WOULD BE SOME SORT OF MISMATCH JUDGMENT SIGNAL IN THE BRAIN.
utt_0202 utt 683.74 689.08 -X AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS, BUT WE, WE DON'T HAVE AN EXPLICIT WAY TO KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
utt_0204 utt 689.08 693.02 -X THERE IS NEVER A BUTTON THAT SAYS, THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO THINK.
utt_0205 utt 693.02 703.84 -X AND THEY SOLVE THIS WITH SOME CONTRASTIVE LEARNING AND THE CONTRASTIVE LEARNING IDEA IS REALLY TO SAY, TO PULL APART, LIKE FIND A LACK OF CONSISTENCY, LIKE FIND THINGS THAT COMES TOGETHER AND IDENTIFY SOME PATTERN.
utt_0208 utt 704.28 707.29 -X MIGHT RUN INTO SYMMETRY ISSUES, THAT'S QUITE TECHNICAL.
utt_0209 utt 707.29 711.39 -X BUT THEY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN WITHOUT ANY CALIBRATION,
utt_0210 utt 711.39 712.77 -X WITHOUT ANY REWARD SIGNALS.
utt_0211 utt 713.43 715.01 -X THAT IS KNOWN, THAT IS.
utt_0212 utt 715.01 722.37 -X AND THEN WE HAVE WORK ON SELF CALIBRATION, THAT'S MY WORK, AND WORK I'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY, SO, WITH PIERRE-YVES, THAT'S PROBABLY IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY,
utt_0214 utt 722.37 723.81 -X AND OTHER PEOPLE YOU MIGHT KNOW.
utt_0215 utt 724.15 732.09 -X AND I HAVE DIFFERENT SETUP, BUT IN THAT CASE IT'S MOSTLY, TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE ON A MAP OR TRYING TO TYPE A SPECIFIC NUMBER, A SPECIFIC TARGET,
utt_0217 utt 732.09 738.88 -X AND YOU DO A TURN TAKING WITH THE MACHINE TO GET WHERE YOU WANT TO GO OR TO WRITE WHAT YOU WANT TO TYPE.
utt_0219 utt 738.88 742.91 -X SO IT'S A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SETTING THAN THE OTHER BEFORE, IT'S MORE TURN TAKING.
utt_0220 utt 742.91 752.41 -X AND THE WAY WE SOLVE THIS IS TO FIND, WE HAVE A SET OF HYPOTHESES OF WHAT YOU MIGHT TRY TO DO, AND THE WAY WE PRINT OUT WITHOUT HAVING AN EXPLICIT GROUND TRUTH
utt_0222 utt 752.99 758.53 -X IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT'S A MORE CONSISTENT CLASSIFIER, WHICH IS WHAT, IN A WAY,
utt_0223 utt 758.53 760.57 -X WHAT, WHERE IS A LACK OF CONTRADICTION.
utt_0224 utt 760.57 762.43 -X AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO DEMO YOU.
utt_0225 utt 762.55 769.28 -X DEFINE A SELF CALIBRATING INTERFACE AS ONE THAT CAN IDENTIFY USERS INTENT WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO CLASSIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR.
utt_0227 utt 769.28 776.80 -X THERE'S A PAPER ON ARXIV THAT REALLY DOES A WALKTHROUGH ON HOW THIS WORKS, AND THERE'S A LOT OF DEMO ONLINE WHERE YOU CAN TRY IT AT HOME.
utt_0229 utt 776.80 778.97 -X SO IF YOU'RE CURIOUS, DO HAVE A LOOK.
utt_0230 utt 778.97 781.50 -X I'M GOING TO RUN YOU THROUGH THE INTERFACE.
utt_0231 utt 781.50 783.93 -X IT'S A VERY SIMPLE INTERFACE WHERE YOU TYPE A CODE ON TOP.
utt_0232 utt 784.35 786.81 -X YOU HAVE NUMBERS DISPLAYED, BUT YOU DON'T CLICK ON THEM.
utt_0233 utt 786.81 788.06 -X THEY'RE JUST FOR INFORMATION.
utt_0234 utt 788.06 790.75 -X AND THE MACHINE JUST DISPLAYS INFORMATION, WHICH IS A COLUMN.
utt_0235 utt 790.75 794.27 -X AND YOU VOTE, IF YOU TYPE A ONE, YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR, IT'S YELLOW,
utt_0236 utt 794.27 795.84 -X LIKE YOU TELL HIM IT'S YELLOW.
utt_0237 utt 795.84 802.43 -X AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS YOU, IF YOU WANT TO ENTER THE FIRST DIGIT INSIDE THE MACHINE, ALL DIGITS ARE POSSIBLE.
utt_0239 utt 802.43 806.85 -X THE MACHINE SHOWS YOU COLOR ON THE DIGITS YOU VOTE, YOU SAY YELLOW.
utt_0240 utt 806.85 809.18 -X AND SO WE CAN SAY IT'S NOT THE GRAY ONE.
utt_0241 utt 809.18 811.97 -X SO WE CAN UPDATE THE MODEL OF WHICH ONE THERE IS.
utt_0242 utt 811.97 817.79 -X AND WE REFINE THIS FURTHER STEP BY STEP BY CHANGING THE COLORING ACCORDING TO WHAT WE KNOW.
utt_0244 utt 817.95 820.35 -X AND SLOWLY WE CAN GET TO ONE ANSWER.
utt_0245 utt 820.35 823.78 -X OKAY, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS WHEN WE KNOW WHAT THE BUTTON MEANS.
utt_0246 utt 824.16 826.40 -X OF COURSE, THAT'S, THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE IS.
utt_0247 utt 826.40 829.92 -X I'LL DO A DEMO JUST TO MAKE SURE WE AGREE AND WE ALIGN OF HOW THIS WORKS.
utt_0248 utt 829.92 837.06 -X I'M GOING TO TYPE A TWO AND I'M GOING TO DO GRAY, GRAY, YELLOW.
utt_0249 utt 837.12 838.43 -X JUST TYPE THE TWO.
utt_0250 utt 838.43 840.86 -X IF I WANT TO TYPE A SIX, SIX IS GRAY.
utt_0251 utt 840.86 842.59 -X I DO GRAY, YELLOW.
utt_0252 utt 842.59 847.01 -X I'M LOOKING AT SIX, GRAY, GRAY, AND I'M JUST TYPED A SIX.
utt_0253 utt 847.61 849.57 -X SO THAT'S HOW THE INTERFACE WORKS.
utt_0254 utt 850.01 851.68 -X AND THAT'S A EASY BIT.
utt_0255 utt 851.68 853.15 -X IT'S PRE CALIBRATED.
utt_0256 utt 853.28 853.95 -X RIGHT?
utt_0257 utt 853.95 855.26 -X SO WE KNOW WHAT THE BUTTON MEANS.
utt_0258 utt 855.26 857.89 -X SO WHERE IS THE SELF CALIBRATION PART IN THERE?
utt_0259 utt 857.89 864.67 -X WELL, WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS YOU HAVE TO REMOVE ONE OF THE INFORMATION WHICH IS WHAT THOSE, THOSE BUTTONS MEAN.
utt_0261 utt 864.67 869.44 -X SO WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU, I NEED TO NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
utt_0262 utt 869.44 871.20 -X SO I REMOVE THE COLOR ON THE BUTTONS.
utt_0263 utt 871.20 872.90 -X AND I'LL GO EVEN ONE STEP FURTHER.
utt_0264 utt 873.37 876.83 -X I'LL NOT EVEN USE BUTTONS, I JUST LET YOU DRAW SOMETHING.
utt_0265 utt 876.89 886.11 -X AND SO IMAGINE THAT FOR YELLOW YOU WANNA DRAW CROSS AND FOR GRAY YOU WANNA DRAW A CIRCLE, BUT YOU'RE FREE TO DO THAT 'CAUSE THAT'S ON THE PREMISES.
utt_0267 utt 886.11 887.87 -X YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT YOU USE.
utt_0268 utt 887.87 891.74 -X SO MAYBE YOU'LL USE Y FOR YELLOW AND A G FOR GRAY.
utt_0269 utt 892.80 901.15 -X MAYBE YOU USE A GRAY, A G FOR YELLOW AND A Y FOR GRAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, OR YOU KNOW, OR WHATEVER.
utt_0271 utt 901.15 903.14 -X YEAH, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
utt_0272 utt 903.14 906.11 -X AND THAT'S WHAT SELF CALIBRATION IS, IS YOU CAN START USING IT.
utt_0273 utt 906.11 911.30 -X YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, AND THE MACHINE WILL STILL FIGURE OUT BOTH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT.
utt_0275 utt 911.30 913.09 -X LET'S DO IT.
utt_0276 utt 914.65 917.57 -X THAT'S THE INTERFACE, YOU CAN TRY IT ONLINE.
utt_0277 utt 917.57 923.43 -X I'M GOING TO DO, I DON'T KNOW, I'M GOING TO DO TYPE ONE AND I'M GOING TO DO A CROSS FOR GRAY.
utt_0279 utt 923.81 924.48 -X RIGHT?
utt_0280 utt 924.48 928.51 -X SO ONE IS GRAY, I'M DOING A CROSS AND FOR A YELLOW, I'M DOING A CIRCLE.
utt_0281 utt 928.51 930.18 -X LOOK AT YELLOW AND I'M GOING TO DO A CIRCLE.
utt_0282 utt 930.18 931.97 -X ONE IS YELLOW, I'M GOING TO DO A CIRCLE.
utt_0283 utt 931.97 933.92 -X ONE IS GREY, I'M GOING TO DO A CROSS.
utt_0284 utt 934.27 936.10 -X ONE IS YELLOW, I'M GOING TO DO A CIRCLE.
utt_0285 utt 936.10 940.10 -X AND OBVIOUSLY YOU SEE HOW MY CIRCLES ARE IMPERFECT, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.
utt_0286 utt 940.10 941.54 -X MY GREY ARE CROSSES.
utt_0287 utt 941.54 942.72 -X I'M CONFIDENT.
utt_0288 utt 942.88 944.03 -X AND IT WORKED.
utt_0289 utt 944.03 946.82 -X I JUST TYPED A ONE, WHAT I TOLD YOU I WAS ABOUT TO DO.
utt_0290 utt 946.91 948.96 -X AND LOOK AT WHAT THE MACHINE FOUND OUT.
utt_0291 utt 948.96 954.24 -X THE MACHINE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS DOING CROSSES FOR GREY AND CIRCLES FOR YELLOW.
utt_0292 utt 957.15 958.50 -X THAT'S KIND OF MAGIC.
utt_0293 utt 958.50 959.65 -X I INVITE YOU TO READ THE PAPER.
utt_0294 utt 959.65 962.27 -X I'M GOING TO DO IT ONCE MORE, DIFFERENT SIDE.
utt_0295 utt 962.27 963.65 -X I'M GOING TO DO A SEVEN.
utt_0296 utt 963.65 968.45 -X I'M GOING TO DO A J, G FOR GRAY AND Y FOR YELLOW, JUST FOR YELLOW.
utt_0297 utt 970.88 972.23 -X I'M DOING A Y, YELLOW.
utt_0298 utt 973.02 974.02 -X I'M DOING A Y.
utt_0299 utt 974.02 974.91 -X I'M LOOKING AT SEVEN.
utt_0300 utt 974.91 975.55 -X I'M DOING A G.
utt_0301 utt 975.55 977.09 -X I'M LOOKING AT SEVEN.
utt_0302 utt 977.09 979.62 -X I'M DOING A G LOOKING AT SEVEN.
utt_0303 utt 979.62 980.35 -X I'M DOING A G.
utt_0304 utt 980.35 980.80 -X IT'S GRAY.
utt_0305 utt 980.80 981.54 -X I'M LOOKING AT SEVEN.
utt_0306 utt 981.54 982.08 -X IT'S YELLOW.
utt_0307 utt 982.08 983.78 -X WE'VE GOT SEVEN.
utt_0308 utt 983.78 984.29 -X IT'S YELLOW.
utt_0309 utt 985.15 988.48 -X IT'S SEVEN, IT'S GRAY, WE'LL GET THERE.
utt_0310 utt 988.48 991.75 -X I'M DOING AT SEVEN, IT'S A GRAY, SEVEN IS YELLOW.
utt_0311 utt 991.75 992.74 -X IT TAKES A BIT MORE TIME.
utt_0312 utt 992.83 997.57 -X NOT SAYING IT'S A ULTIMATE INTERFACE YET, BUT LOOK, I'VE JUST TYPED A SEVEN,
utt_0313 utt 997.57 999.30 -X WHICH IS A DIFFERENT NUMBER THAN BEFORE.
utt_0314 utt 999.30 1000.03 -X I'M NOT CHEATING.
utt_0315 utt 1000.03 1008.67 -X AND I USE DIFFERENT, THE SAME INTERFACE, DIFFERENT WAYS TO EXPRESS WHAT I WANTED TO SAY, AND THE MACHINE UNDERSTOOD BOTH.
utt_0317 utt 1008.67 1011.78 -X SO THAT IS GETTING CLOSER TO WHAT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER IS.
utt_0318 utt 1011.87 1017.70 -X IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, I HAVE VERY NICE VISUAL TUTORIALS AVAILABLE ONLINE.
utt_0319 utt 1017.70 1021.60 -X IF YOU READ THAT PAPER OR ASK ME, THAT EXPLAIN YOU HOW THIS WORKS.
utt_0320 utt 1022.65 1025.89 -X THAT IS WHAT WE APPLY TO BRAIN COMPUTER INTERFACES.
utt_0321 utt 1025.89 1026.24 -X SO.
utt_0322 utt 1027.01 1028.45 -X MORE COMPLEX PROBLEMS.
utt_0323 utt 1028.67 1035.01 -X WE HAVE A PAPER ON SIMULATED DATA FROM two thousand and fourteen AND WE HAVE A PAPER ON REAL DATA
utt_0324 utt 1035.42 1040.26 -X FROM two thousand and fifteen THAT SHOWS YOU THAT IT WORKS LIVE WITH USERS AND IN REAL TIME.
utt_0325 utt 1042.34 1044.58 -X SO WHAT IS THIS TELLING US?
utt_0326 utt 1044.58 1052.20 -X IT'S TELLING US THAT, YES, I THINK WITH RECENT WORK WE CAN GET A BIT CLOSER TO THIS PART ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER.
utt_0328 utt 1052.86 1061.70 -X ON ONE SIDE, PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO MAXIMIZE MUTUAL INFORMATION, ON THE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO IDENTIFY MOST COHERENT HYPOTHESIS BY SORTING OUT, CONSISTENCY.
utt_0330 utt 1061.70 1068.93 -X I'LL HAVE A LOOK AT THOSE PAPERS TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT THAT IS, BUT, BUT I THINK THERE IS STILL A LIMIT, RIGHT?
utt_0332 utt 1069.50 1071.56 -X ON ONE SIDE, IT TAKES TIME.
utt_0333 utt 1071.56 1077.41 -X IT'S JUST SLOW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ITERATING TO FIND THE BEST HYPOTHESIS, RIGHT?
utt_0335 utt 1077.47 1080.52 -X ONE HYPOTHESIS AT A TIME, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DISPLAY,
utt_0336 utt 1080.52 1081.67 -X WE HAVE TO INTERACT WITH IT.
utt_0337 utt 1081.92 1083.84 -X SO IT'S SLOW, RIGHT?
utt_0338 utt 1083.84 1088.45 -X SO REALLY, THOSE ARE PROBABLY A BIT SLOWER, LIKE A BIT LOWER ON THE SCALE.
utt_0339 utt 1088.45 1093.35 -X AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT THERE NO DIRECT CONTROL,
utt_0340 utt 1093.35 1098.63 -X LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF DOING A BACK AND FORTH, YOU'RE JUST REACTING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING, YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL REALLY.
utt_0342 utt 1098.63 1101.64 -X AND THAT IS NOT ALSO, IT'S NOT REALLY NATURAL, RIGHT?
utt_0343 utt 1101.64 1111.04 -X THAT'S, THAT'S A LIMIT TO HOW IMMEDIATELY USABLE IT IS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS TURN TAKING, AND YOU CANNOT, YOU KNOW, THE MACHINE HAS TO WAIT THAT IT UNDERSTAND TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING, RIGHT?
utt_0346 utt 1111.04 1114.82 -X THE DIGIT IS NOT SHOWN AFTER A FEW STEPS, TAKES TIME, WHICH.
utt_0347 utt 1114.82 1116.29 -X IN A WAY, IT MAKES SENSE.
utt_0348 utt 1116.29 1117.09 -X IT'S A HARD PROBLEM.
utt_0349 utt 1117.09 1118.88 -X BUT COULD WE DO BETTER?
utt_0350 utt 1118.88 1119.78 -X COULD WE DO BETTER?
utt_0351 utt 1119.78 1122.40 -X SO, WELL, HOW, HOW DO WE GET HERE?
utt_0352 utt 1122.40 1124.61 -X AND THAT'S MY CHALLENGE FOR THE COMMUNITY.
utt_0353 utt 1124.93 1135.91 -X AND TO CONCLUDE, I WANT TO SAY THAT WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME IS THAT I'M TRYING TO WORK ON EMG SIGNALS, ON THIS NICE SENSOR WITH DRY ELECTRODES.
utt_0355 utt 1136.13 1138.63 -X I'M TRYING TO USE THAT TO DO A DIRECT CONTROL TASK.
utt_0356 utt 1138.63 1144.49 -X AND I HAVE SOME PARTNERSHIPS ALREADY IN PLACE WITH IMPERIAL COLLEGE ON NEW, LIKE.
utt_0357 utt 1144.49 1151.65 -X INNOVATIVE MATHEMATICAL METHODS TO ANALYZE THOSE DATA THAT MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE DOWNSTREAM SELF CALIBRATION TASK.
utt_0359 utt 1151.65 1158.41 -X AND IF YOU'RE IN THE ROOM AND ARE INTERESTED IN THIS AS AN INDUSTRIAL PARTNER OR AN ACADEMIC PARTNER, PLEASE DO REACH OUT.
utt_0361 utt 1158.72 1161.29 -X MY CONTACTS ARE HERE.
utt_0362 utt 1161.73 1166.98 -X AND IF YOU WANT TO FEEDBACK ON THIS TALK, THERE IS ALSO A FEEDBACK FORM OR GET IN TOUCH.
utt_0364 utt 1167.04 1167.88 -2.0133 THANK YOU.
