utt_0000 utt 4.08 11.22 -X IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE, YOU ARE INTEGRATED WITH A COMPUTER TO NAVIGATE THE ENVIRONMENT
utt_0001 utt 11.34 12.27 -X LIKE THIS,
utt_0003 utt 16.69 20.39 -X LIKE THIS? ... BUT, MORE DISCREETLY
utt_0004 utt 22.00 23.35 -X OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
utt_0006 utt 28.01 30.35 -X IS NOT, LET ME TELL YOU WHY
utt_0007 utt 32.17 37.67 -X IN THIS WORK, WE EXPLORE INTEGRATED EXERTION, THIS IS THE DESIGN SPACE
utt_0008 utt 37.81 46.16 -X AT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN, HUMAN-COMPUTER INTEGRATION, WHERE THE USER AND THE SYSTEM CO-OPERATE IN A PARTNERSHIP
utt_0009 utt 46.54 54.16 -X AND EXERTION SUPPORT, WHERE THE USER INVESTS PHYSICAL EFFORT AS PART OF THE USER EXPERIENCE.
utt_0010 utt 54.90 64.37 -X AND IN THE EXPERIENCE OF INTEGRATION, THE SYSTEM IS CONSTANTLY SENSING AND INTERPRETING DATA IN ORDER TO ACT IN THE EXPERIENCE
utt_0011 utt 65.20 75.05 -X AND THE DATA THAT WE EXPLORE IN THIS WORK IS THE USER'S NEUROLOGICAL DATA READ VIA EEG FROM THE OCCIPITAL REGION
utt_0012 utt 75.57 83.16 -X THAT IS THE ORANGE PART ON THE BACK OF THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR VISION PROCESSING
utt_0013 utt 83.16 92.47 -X READING THIS DATA CAN TELL US WHEN A USER IS, OR IS NOT, IN A STATE OF PERIPHERAL AWARENESS IN REAL-TIME, AND THIS IS WHAT WE BUILT
utt_0018 utt 108.37 109.82 -X zero point seven six AND one point one nine MICROVOLTS
utt_0020 utt 114.10 116.95 -X THESE CORRESPOND TO THE RIDER'S FIELD OF VIEW
utt_0025 utt 131.45 132.60 -X IN THIS CASE,
utt_0029 utt 142.22 144.92 -X WHERE INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED
utt_0037 utt 178.59 185.70 -X OUR WORK INTRODUCES AND DEMONSTRATES PERIPHERAL AWARENESS AS A NEUROLOGICAL STATE TO HCI
utt_0038 utt 187.36 198.27 -X THIS IS A NEW APPROACH WE CAN USE TO STUDY USER'S OF OUR SYSTEMS THROUGH A NON-INVASIVE NEURO-PHYSIO LIGHTWEIGHT AND REAL-TIME APPROACH
utt_0040 utt 198.78 203.15 -X FOR EXAMPLE, TO INFORM FUTURE HEALTH INTEGRATIONS
utt_0041 utt 203.26 208.03 -X THAT HELP USER'S IN DEVELOPING PRACTICE TO REACH PERIPHERAL AWARENESS
utt_0042 utt 208.25 211.75 -X AND HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ABILITIES
utt_0043 utt 214.11 215.55 -X TAKE AWAY TWO,
utt_0049 utt 237.34 242.95 -X THIS IS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS, SUCH AS,
utt_0050 utt 242.95 246.15 -X NAVIGATING THE ENVIRONMENT, OPERATING MACHINERY
utt_0051 utt 246.56 250.55 -X EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TEAM OPERATIONS
utt_0052 utt 250.75 255.11 -X WHERE THE USER BENEFITS FROM HAVING A WIDER AWARENESS
utt_0053 utt 255.30 259.62 -X OF THE ENVIRONMENT TAKE AWAY THREE,
utt_0055 utt 261.22 268.26 -X INTEGRATION DIRECTLY FROM THE USER'S BRAIN CAN FACILITATE A SYMBIOTIC-LIKE EXPERIENCE
utt_0057 utt 269.16 278.01 -X AND TO TALK ABOUT THIS, I'M GOING TO USE THIS CHART FROM PREVIOUS WORK WHERE WE SEE THE SYSTEM AS AN EQUAL TO THE USER
utt_0059 utt 279.08 286.31 -X IN THIS CASE THE USER AND THE SYSTEM HAVE THEIR OWN SENSING ABILITIES THAT THAT CAN COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER
utt_0061 utt 287.14 292.20 -X IN WHAT FAROOQ AND GRUDIN CALLED, WORKING AS PARTNERS
utt_0062 utt 292.49 297.03 -X AND PARTNERS IMPLIES TWO AGENTS, HOWEVER,
utt_0063 utt 297.38 303.98 -X MANN, PREVIOUSLY SAID THAT ONCE COMPUTERS SYSTEMS REACH MORE ADVANCE ABILITIES
utt_0064 utt 304.20 307.93 -X THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE SYSTEM WAS GOING TO BLUR
utt_0065 utt 308.07 310.99 -X AND THE USER AND THE SYSTEM WOULD BECOME ONE
utt_0066 utt 311.94 313.58 -X IN LIGHT OF THIS VISION,
utt_0067 utt 314.15 321.77 -X WE SEE NOW IN THIS WORK THE SYSTEM AND THE USER ARE ONE AND BECAUSE IN THE sixty'S LICKLIDER ALSO TOLD US ABOUT
