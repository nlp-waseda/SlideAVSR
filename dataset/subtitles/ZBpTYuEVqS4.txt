utt_0000 utt 0.22 11.09 -X HI, MY NAME IS VINCENT, AND I'M FROM THE SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING LAB AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON. ON BEHALF OF MY CO-AUTHORS CHRISTINE AND PATRICK,
utt_0002 utt 11.09 18.26 -X I WILL BE PRESENTING OUR ICASSP PAPER POLYNOMIAL EVD OF SPHERICAL HARMONICS FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT.
utt_0003 utt 22.70 35.70 -X SPEECH ENHANCEMENT IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY APPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEARING AIDS TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ASR, AND VOICE CONTROL HOME SYSTEMS. IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS, HOWEVER,
utt_0005 utt 35.70 41.52 -X THE SPEECH SIGNAL IS OFTEN DEGRADED BY BACKGROUND NOISE AND REVERBERATION,
utt_0006 utt 41.52 51.79 -X WHICH WILL OFTEN REDUCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS. AS SUCH, THE PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHMS TO PROCESS THE RECEIVED SIGNALS.
utt_0008 utt 53.04 60.05 -X BECAUSE PRIOR INFORMATION OF THE TARGET SPEECH AND ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT ARE UNAVAILABLE,
utt_0009 utt 60.05 66.99 -X BLIND AND UNSUPERVISED APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED.
utt_0010 utt 66.99 70.13 -X EXISTING SUBSPACE APPROACHES FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT
utt_0011 utt 71.02 78.93 -X USE AN EVD TO DECORRELATE SPECTRALLY AND SPATIALLY FOR A SINGLE CHANNEL AND MULTI-CHANNEL SYSTEM,
utt_0012 utt 78.93 92.98 -X RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, AN EVD CAN ONLY DECORATE INSTANTANEOUSLY, WHICH IS INADEQUATE FOR SPEECH SIGNALS THAT NATURALLY EXHIBIT TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT MICROPHONES.
utt_0014 utt 94.64 108.43 -X THE PROPOSED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT BASED ON POLYNOMIAL EVD CAN IMPOSE SPATIAL DECORRELATION OVER A RANGE OF TIME SHIFTS. THE APPROACH IS EFFECTIVE FOR NOISE REDUCTION AND DEREVERBERATION
utt_0016 utt 108.62 121.49 -X USING VARIOUS MICROPHONE ARRAY GEOMETRIES. THE COMPLEXITY, HOWEVER, DOES NOT SCALE WELL WITH THE NUMBER OF SIGNALS USED IN THE PROCESSING. IN THIS TALK, WE WILL FOCUS
utt_0018 utt 121.49 132.47 -X ON SPHERICAL MICROPHONE ARRAYS AND EXPLAIN HOW TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SIGNALS USED FOR PROCESSING.
utt_0019 utt 132.47 146.07 -X USING THE REVERBERANT CHANNEL MODEL, THE RECEIVED SIGNALS X CAN BE DECOMPOSED INTO THE SPEECH COMPONENTS IN BLUE, WHICH COMPRISES THE DIRECT PATH AND EARLY REFLECTIONS, AS WELL AS THE
utt_0021 utt 146.09 153.33 -X NOISE COMPONENT IN RED, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE LATE REFLECTIONS AND ADDITIVE NOISE COMPONENTS.
utt_0022 utt 154.83 163.38 -X ACROSS Q SENSORS, THE DATA VECTOR IS WRITTEN AS THE FOLLOWING.
utt_0023 utt 163.38 166.10 -X THE PEVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM IS PRESENTED HERE,
utt_0024 utt 166.42 172.37 -X AND THE GOAL IS TO OBTAIN AN ENHANCED OUTPUT USING ONLY THE MICROPHONE OBSERVATIONS X.
utt_0025 utt 172.37 179.38 -X THE RECEIVED SIGNALS FOR ALL MICROPHONES ARE THEN USED TO COMPUTE THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX,
utt_0026 utt 179.38 192.34 -X WHICH IS THEN USED AS THE INPUT INTO THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM TO GENERATE THE EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES. THE RECEIVED SIGNALS ARE THEN FILTERED THROUGH
utt_0028 utt 192.34 196.79 -X THE EIGENVECTOR FILTERBANK TO PRODUCE THE ENHANCED SIGNALS.
utt_0029 utt 198.77 211.64 -X FOR SPHERICAL MICROPHONE ARRAYS, THE SPHERICAL HARMONICS PROVIDE A COMPACT REPRESENTATION OF AN ORDER-LIMITED THREE-DIMENSIONAL SOUND FIELD. THE SHT CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
utt_0031 utt 211.64 218.20 -X SIGNALS USED TO REPRESENT THE SOUND FIELD WHERE CALLIGRAPHIC L IS TYPICALLY MUCH SMALLER THAN Q.
utt_0032 utt 219.44 227.64 -X WITH POLYNOMIAL EVD APPLIED TO L INSTEAD OF Q, THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED.
utt_0033 utt 227.64 237.72 -X THE SPHERICAL HARMONIC DECOMPOSITION (SHD) OF THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE L-TH ORDER
utt_0034 utt 237.81 243.32 -X M-TH DEGREE BASIS FUNCTION R IS GIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING.
utt_0035 utt 244.53 249.20 -X THE INVERSE TRANSFORM, WHICH ALLOWS US TO RECOVER THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS,
utt_0036 utt 249.20 257.88 -X USES A WEIGHTED SUM OF THE SPHERICAL HARMONIC BASIS. REGULAR L DENOTES THE MAXIMUM
utt_0037 utt 257.91 264.37 -X SPHERICAL HARMONIC ORDER OF THE SOUND VIEW, AND CALLIGRAPHIC L IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EIGEN BEAMS.
utt_0038 utt 267.92 271.83 -X THIS SLIDE VISUALIZES THE SPHERICAL HARMONIC BASIS FUNCTIONS.
utt_0039 utt 272.59 276.12 -X FOR AN ORDER ONE APPROXIMATION OF THE SOUND FIELD,
utt_0040 utt 276.47 285.75 -X THERE ARE FOUR EIGEN BEAMS, AND SIMILARLY, FOR AN ORDER two APPROXIMATION, WE WILL HAVE nine EIGEN BEAMS.
utt_0041 utt 288.02 296.12 -X WE NOW USE AN EXAMPLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE COMPRESSION ABILITY OF THE SHD. USING DIFFERENT
utt_0042 utt 296.12 303.13 -X SPHERICAL HARMONIC ORDERS TO APPROXIMATE THE SOUND VIEW MEASURED BY A thirty-two MICROPHONE SPHERICAL ARRAY,
utt_0043 utt 303.13 314.77 -X WE FIND THAT THE APPROXIMATION IMPROVES AS WE USE MORE EIGEN BEAMS AS EXPECTED. MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS ALSO CAPTURED USING A MODEST ORDER WITH LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT
utt_0045 utt 314.90 327.19 -X ERROR. USING DIFFERENT SPHERICAL HARMONIC ORDER ALSO AFFECTS THE COMPUTATIONAL SAVINGS ATTAINED BY USING SMALLER NUMBER OF SIGNALS FOR THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM.
utt_0047 utt 329.55 342.36 -X THIS SLIDE SUMMARIZES OUR PROPOSED ALGORITHM. INSTEAD OF APPLYING THE POLYNOMIAL EVD TO THE thirty-two MICROPHONE SIGNALS DIRECTLY, WE FIRST APPROXIMATE THE SOUND FIELD WITH LOW
utt_0049 utt 342.36 348.09 -X ORDER SPHERICAL HARMONICS. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS WILL GENERATE A SMALLER NUMBER OF EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS
utt_0050 utt 348.21 361.11 -X ON WHICH THE PEVD CAN NOW OPERATE AT REDUCED COMPLEXITY. THE GENERATED EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRIX IS THEN USED BY THE EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS TO GENERATE THE ENHANCED OUTPUT.
utt_0052 utt 365.59 379.67 -X ASSUMING STATIONARITY, THE EIGEN BEAMS ARE USED TO COMPUTE THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX. EACH ELEMENT IS THE CROSS-CORRELATION FUNCTION BETWEEN THE BEAMS, AND TAU IS THE TIME SHIFT PARAMETER.
utt_0054 utt 379.67 385.53 -X THE Z TRANSFORM OF THIS COVARIANCE MATRIX GIVES US A PARA-HERMITIAN
utt_0055 utt 385.78 396.66 -X MATRIX EXPRESSED AS THE FOLLOWING. IN THIS TALK, WE WILL USE THE REGULAR FONT TO DENOTE MATRICES AND CALLIGRAPHIC FONT TO DENOTE POLYNOMIAL MATRICES.
utt_0057 utt 396.66 405.05 -X HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FIRST-ORDER EIGEN BEAMS AND THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0058 utt 405.43 416.47 -X DIAGONALS ARE COMPUTED USING THE AUTOCORRELATION FUNCTIONS OF THE EIGEN BEAMS, WHEREAS THE OFF-DIAGONAL ELEMENTS ARE COMPUTED USING THE CROSS-CORRELATION
utt_0060 utt 416.47 425.62 -X BETWEEN EIGEN BEAMS. SO THIS WOULD BE BETWEEN BEAM ONE AND TWO, ONE AND THREE, ONE AND FOUR.
utt_0061 utt 425.62 432.44 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD OF THIS SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX IS GIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING EXPRESSION,
utt_0062 utt 432.82 438.94 -X WHERE LAMBDA AND U ARE THE EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES,
utt_0063 utt 440.08 443.16 -X SUPERSCRIPT P IS THE PARA-HERMITIAN
utt_0064 utt 443.38 449.02 -X OPERATOR, WHICH INVOLVES THE HERMITIAN TRANSPOSE OPERATION FOLLOWED BY A TIME-REVERSAL.
utt_0065 utt 453.01 456.47 -X BECAUSE THE SPEECH AND NOISE COMPONENTS ARE UNCORRELATED,
utt_0066 utt 457.21 463.58 -X POLYNOMIAL EVD DECOMPOSES THE MATRIX INTO ORTHOGONAL SIGNAL AND NOISE SUBSPACES.
utt_0067 utt 466.74 471.77 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD OF THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX COMPUTED EARLIER IS SHOWN.
utt_0068 utt 471.77 475.35 -X ON THE LEFT, WE HAVE THE EIGENVALUE, AND ON THE RIGHT,
utt_0069 utt 475.35 479.10 -X WE HAVE THE EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRIX, WHICH WILL BE USED LATER.
utt_0070 utt 481.72 486.65 -X TO COMPUTE THE POLYNOMIAL EVD, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED.
utt_0071 utt 490.20 502.81 -X THE EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS ARE FILTERED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK U(Z) TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUTS Y THAT ARE STRONGLY DECORATED. BECAUSE WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING A SINGLE SPEAKER,
utt_0073 utt 502.97 505.91 -X THE ENHANCED SPEECH CAN BE RECOVERED IN THE FIRST CHANNEL
utt_0074 utt 506.13 510.17 -X BY A WEIGHTED RECONSTRUCTION USING THE SPEECH SUBSPACE.
utt_0075 utt 510.17 521.91 -X SO, THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT ON THE RIGHT IS GENERATED BY FILTERING THE EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS ON THE LEFT
utt_0076 utt 522.26 525.82 -X THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTER BANK GENERATED EARLIER.
utt_0077 utt 529.33 543.32 -X THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT SETUP IS USED. WE SIMULATE THE ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSES USING THE SMIRGEN TOOL, THE SPEECH SOURCE SIGNALS ARE OBTAINED FROM TIMIT, AND THE SOURCE AND
utt_0079 utt 543.32 551.07 -X MICROPHONE ARRAYS ARE PLACED ALONG THE X-AXIS. IN THIS SCENARIO, THERE IS zero DB WHITE NOISE.
utt_0080 utt 555.96 570.43 -X WE COMPARE TWO VERSIONS OF OUR PROPOSED ALGORITHM, WHICH USES THE FIRST-ORDER AND SECOND-ORDER SPHERICAL HARMONICS DECOMPOSITION. CONSEQUENTLY, WE WILL HAVE four AND nine EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS FOR THE
utt_0082 utt 570.43 577.39 -X POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM. TWO EIGEN BEAMS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED, THE OMNIDIRECTIONAL BEAM \CHI
utt_0083 utt 577.39 587.04 -X OF ZERO ZERO AND THE DIRECTIONAL BEAM \CHI OF ONE ONE THAT IS DIRECTED AT THE SOURCE. KLT IS APPLIED
utt_0084 utt 587.04 595.96 -X TO THE OMNIDIRECTIONAL BEAM. THE RAW PEVD, WHICH OPERATES ON ALL thirty-two MICROPHONES, IS ALSO USED.
utt_0085 utt 595.96 605.02 -X THE ENHANCEMENT MEASURES INCLUDE THE FREQUENCY WEIGHTED SEGMENTAL SNR, STOI,
utt_0086 utt 606.14 610.01 -X PESQ, AND THE BARK SPECTRAL DISTORTION (BSD).
utt_0087 utt 613.43 619.74 -X THIS TABLE SUMMARIZES THE PERFORMANCE. POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHMS PERFORM COMPARABLY,
utt_0088 utt 619.93 624.19 -X WITH PEVD Ltwo PERFORMING BEST IN ALL METRICS.
utt_0089 utt 624.19 629.12 -X WE WILL FIRST LISTEN TO THE NOISY SIGNAL BEFORE LISTENING TO RAW PEVD AND PEVD Ltwo.
utt_0090 utt 629.12 629.98 -X THE NOISY SIGNAL.
utt_0091 utt 629.98 640.06 -X (BUT NOW SHE'S SAYING LOWER TO THE LEFT ANOTHER BRAND OF INDEFINITE REFERENCE ARISES OUT OF THE USE OF THE DOUBLE VERB SHIFT BUILDING IS THE MOST FASCINATING PROCESS THE ROLE)
utt_0093 utt 640.06 646.20 -X RAW PEVD (BUT NOW SHE'S SAYING GLOWER TO THE ROCK ANOTHER BRAND OF INDEFINITE REFERENCE ARISES OUT OF THE USE OF THE DOUBLE VERB SHIPBUILDING IS THE MOST FASCINATING PROCESS)
utt_0096 utt 646.20 646.43 -X PEVD Ltwo
utt_0099 utt 657.50 663.77 -X AFTER PEVD Ltwo, THE EIGEN BEAM THAT'S DIRECTED AT THE SOURCE \CHI ONE ONE HAS THE BEST STOI. WE NOW LISTEN TO \CHI ONE ONE.
utt_0101 utt 665.21 674.24 -X (NOW SHE'S SAYING GLOWER TO THE ROCK ANOTHER BRAND OF INDEFINITE REFERENCE ARISES OUT OF THE USE OF THE DOUBLE VERB SHIFT BUILDING IS THE MOST FASCINATING PROCESS)
utt_0103 utt 674.24 679.10 -X APPLYING THE KLT TO THE OMNI-BEAM IMPROVES ALL MEASURES EXCEPT FOR STOI.
utt_0104 utt 679.10 683.58 -X IN THIS SMIRGEN SCENARIO, THE SOURCE AND MICROPHONE ARRAY LIE ALONG THE SAME X-AXIS.
utt_0105 utt 683.58 688.41 -X WE NOW CONSIDER THE CASE WHERE THEY DON'T LIE ON THE SAME AXIS.
utt_0106 utt 688.41 693.02 -X TO DO THAT WE USE THE ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSES AND NOISE SIGNALS MEASURED IN THE ACE CORPUS.
utt_0107 utt 693.02 696.70 -X \CHI ONE ONE NO LONGER PERFORMS WELL IN STOI BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER
utt_0108 utt 698.55 703.26 -X DIRECTED AT THE SOURCE AND MAY PICK UP WEAKER REVERBERANT COMPONENTS ALONG WITH NOISE.
utt_0109 utt 703.26 718.24 -X AT - ten DB SNR, PEVD Lone, AND Ltwo PERFORM BETTER THAN THE RAW PEVD BECAUSE THE GENERATED EIGEN BEAMS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NOISE REDUCTION OFFERED BY THE SIGNAL INDEPENDENT SPHERICAL HARMONICS PROCESSING BUT THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE TO RAW PEVD.
utt_0112 utt 718.24 730.94 -X AT OTHER SNRS, THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHMS PERFORM COMPARABLY WELL EVEN THOUGH PEVD Lone AND Ltwo USE four AND nine EIGEN BEAM SIGNALS COMPARED TO THE thirty-two MICROPHONE SIGNALS USED IN THE RAW PEVD APPROACH.
utt_0114 utt 730.94 741.25 -X IN THIS TALK, (WE HAVE SHOWN THAT) THE POLYNOMIAL EVD OF EIGEN BEAMS IS EFFECTIVE FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT IN NOISY REVERBERANT ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0116 utt 741.25 750.88 -X THE PROPOSED APPROACH PERFORMS ALMOST IDENTICALLY AND SOMETIMES EVEN BETTER THAN RAW PEVD. THIS IS ACHIEVED USING ONLY A FRACTION OF THE COMPLEXITY FACTOR OF RAW PEVD.
utt_0118 utt 750.88 760.08 -X THIS PROPOSED APPROACH IS ALSO ROBUST EVEN WHEN EIGEN BEAMS ARE NOT STEERED TOWARDS THE SPEAKER
utt_0119 utt 760.64 765.47 -X AND IS A COMPLETELY BLIND AND UNSUPERVISED METHOD.
utt_0120 utt 765.47 769.70 -X THESE ARE THE REFERENCES USED IN THIS TALK.
