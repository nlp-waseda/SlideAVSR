utt_0000 utt 0.22 5.94 -X HI EVERYBODY, MY NAME IS KONSTANTIN KLAMKA AND TODAY, I WILL PRESENT “RAPID IRON-ON USER INTERFACES”.
utt_0001 utt 5.96 15.89 -X THIS PROJECT IS JOINT WORK WITH RAIMUND DACHSELT FROM THE INTERACTIVE MEDIA LAB AT THE TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN AND JÜRGEN STEIMLE FROM THE HCI LAB AT SAARLAND UNIVERSITY.
utt_0003 utt 17.04 20.02 -X SO, LET US START WITH THE EMERGING TREND OF E-TEXTILES.
utt_0004 utt 20.02 30.48 -X RECENT ADVANCES IN FUNCTIONAL TEXTILES AND ELECTRONIC MINIATURIZATION ARE BRINGING A NEW GENERATION OF WEARABLE USER INTERFACES THAT ARE DEEPLY INTEGRATED INTO OUR CLOTHING.
utt_0006 utt 30.48 36.43 -X FURTHER APPLICATIONS CAN BE FOUND IN THE FIELDS OF FASHION, SMART WORKWEAR, MEDICAL APPLICATIONS,
utt_0007 utt 36.43 38.93 -X ACTIVE SPORT WEAR AND ACCESSORIES.
utt_0008 utt 39.25 46.61 -X BUT A REMAINING QUESTION HERE IS HOW TECHNOLOGY-ENTHUSIASTIC MAKERS AND INNOVATIVE DESIGNERS COULD TAKE PART IN THIS DEVELOPMENT?
utt_0010 utt 48.11 53.43 -X WHILE MAKERS HAVE GREAT TECHNICAL SKILLS AND THE CAPABILITIES TO INNOVATE AND PROTOTYPE
utt_0011 utt 53.49 56.40 -X THEY OFTEN USE MANUAL SEWING TECHNIQUES.
utt_0012 utt 56.40 61.14 -X HOWEVER, THE MANUAL FABRICATION ON THE YARN-LEVEL IS QUITE TIME-CONSUMING AND CUMBERSOME.
utt_0013 utt 63.37 67.75 -X IN ADDITION, TEXTILE AND FASHION DESIGNER REQUIRE WEARABLE PROTOTYPING TOOLKITS
utt_0014 utt 67.76 69.52 -X FOR EARLY DESIGN STAGES.
utt_0015 utt 69.52 72.72 -X BUT THEY COMMONLY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERT MACHINERY.
utt_0016 utt 72.85 76.95 -X THESE KINDS OF MACHINES ARE TYPICALLY OUTSIDE THE REALM OF A PROTOTYPING SPACE.
utt_0017 utt 78.38 85.91 -X BY LOOKING AT EMERGING MATERIALS LIKE CONDUCTIVE OR RESISTIVE FABRICS AS WELL AS THE CONTINUOUS PROGRESS IN FLEXIBLE AND PRINTED ELECTRONICS,
utt_0019 utt 85.91 92.02 -X WE THOUGHT ABOUT HOW CAN WE DEVELOP AN EASY AND SKETCHING-LIKE FABRICATION APPROACH?
utt_0020 utt 92.02 97.17 -X INSPIRED BY THE SKETCHING-LIKE INTERACTION OF HANDHELD CORRECTION TAPE OR PACKAGING TAPE DISPENSER,
utt_0021 utt 97.17 105.84 -X WE INTRODUCE RAPID IRON-ON USER INTERFACES – A NOVEL FABRICATION TECHNIQUE TO COMBINE DESIGN AND FABRICATION INTO A SINGLE PROCESS.
utt_0023 utt 107.38 114.10 -X THEREFORE, WE DEVELOPED A HANDHELD IRONING TOOL THAT DIRECTLY TRANSFERS ADHESIVE FUNCTIONAL TAPES AND PATCHES ONTO FABRICS.
utt_0025 utt 114.38 119.41 -X THE DEVICE USES AN IRON THAT COULD BE PUSHED FOR BONDING TAPES VIA HEAT ACTIVATION.
utt_0026 utt 119.70 122.87 -X THE TAPES ITSELF ARE ROLLED ON SPOOLS WITH A CARRIER LAYER.
utt_0027 utt 123.12 130.36 -X AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE VIDEO IT IS POSSIBLE TO IRON-ON TRACES IN A SKETCHING-LIKE FASHION.
utt_0028 utt 130.36 135.93 -X FURTHER, WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL COMPONENTS THAT COULD BE IRONED AND INTRODUCED A COMPRESSIVE LIBRARY OF COMPONENTS.
utt_0030 utt 137.59 146.97 -X TO DEMONSTRATE THE VERSATILITY OF OUR TOOLKIT, WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED APPLICATIONS FOR UBIQUITOUS AND WEARABLE COMPUTING.
utt_0032 utt 146.97 150.93 -X FINALLY, WE CONDUCTED TECHNICAL EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS EXPERT REVIEWS.
utt_0033 utt 151.06 156.28 -X BUT BEFORE I GO INTO DETAILS, I WILL BRIEFLY POSITION OUR WORK IN THE CONTEXT OF PRIOR RESEARCH.
utt_0034 utt 157.91 167.25 -X SO, IF WE LOOK AT CRAFTING TECHNIQUES, BUECHELY AND COLLEAGUES PIONEERED THE LILYPAD PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS TO CONNECT ELECTRONICS WITH CONDUCTIVE YARNS AND LASER-CUT FABRICS.
utt_0036 utt 167.79 172.41 -X IN ADDITION, KIT-OF-NO-PARTS INTRODUCES AN APPROACH OF CRAFTING ELECTRONICS
utt_0037 utt 172.53 174.87 -X RATHER THAN DESIGNING DISCRETE COMPONENTS.
utt_0038 utt 174.87 177.56 -X SCHNITTMUSTER DISCUSSES A META TOOLKIT.
utt_0039 utt 179.09 185.02 -X IN CONTRAST, READY-MADE TOOLKITS ALLOW PROTOTYPING WITH PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS.
utt_0040 utt 185.17 193.18 -X RESEARCH LIKE I*CATCH, MAKERWEAR AND BODYHUB BUILD ON THE IDEA OF CUSTOMIZABLE BODY-WORN BUILDING BLOCKS.
utt_0042 utt 193.18 200.76 -X FINALLY, ZPATCHES ENABLE RESISTIVE AND CAPACITIVE SENSING AND CAN BE IRONED ONTO TEXTILES.
utt_0043 utt 200.76 206.81 -X FURTHERMORE, PROJECTS, LIKE JACQUARD, DEMONSTRATE HOW SMART TEXTILES COULD BE PRODUCED AT LARGE-SCALE.
utt_0044 utt 206.81 211.99 -X SMARTSLEEVE AND RESI INTRODUCE ON-CLOTHING INTERACTION BASED ON RESISTIVE SENSING MATRICES.
utt_0045 utt 212.63 221.75 -X SOFT INKJET CIRCUITS DEMONSTRATES HOW MULTI-MATERIAL INKJET PRINTING ENABLES CIRCUITS ON A VARIETY OF SUBSTRATES INCLUDING IRON-ON TEXTILE FILMS.
utt_0047 utt 223.12 228.79 -X SINCE OUR WORK IS INSPIRED BY CUTTABLE SMART TAPES, WE ALSO LOOKED INTO THIS RESEARCH:
utt_0048 utt 228.79 231.80 -X WHILE SHAPETAPE AND SENSORTAPE CAPTURE ITS DEFORMATION,
utt_0049 utt 231.80 234.62 -X TOUCHTAPE ALLOW TO SENSE THE HANDS POSITION.
utt_0050 utt 234.62 240.60 -X AMOHR TAPES ARE COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE HIGH-CONDUCTIVE AND STRETCHABLE TEXTILE RIBBONS.
utt_0051 utt 240.60 244.28 -X FINALLY, RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE IN INTERACTIVE FABRICATION AND CONSTRUCTION.
utt_0052 utt 244.37 249.91 -X MOST RELATED TO OUR WORK IS SKETCH&AMPSTITCH THAT COMBINE THE DESIGN OF COMPONENTS BY SKETCHING
utt_0053 utt 249.94 253.63 -X AND THE FABRICATION BY USING AN AUTOMATED EMBROIDERY MACHINE.
utt_0054 utt 255.00 260.54 -X LET’S GET BACK TO OUR RAPID IRON-ON TOOLS AND SEE HOW THE IRONING PROCESS WORKS IN DETAIL.
utt_0055 utt 260.54 265.15 -X THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE WAY HOW WE CONSTRUCTED THE MATERIAL SPOOLS.
utt_0056 utt 267.32 271.23 -X THE IRON-ON MATERIAL STACK BASICALLY CONSISTS OF THREE LAYERS.
utt_0057 utt 271.96 276.76 -X A CARRIER LAYER, A FUNCTIONAL LAYER AND AN ADHESIVE LAYER.
utt_0058 utt 277.53 286.59 -X THE FIRST LAYER SERVES US AS CARRIER FOR ALL IRON-ON SPOOLS AND IS MADE OF HEAT-RESISTIVE BAKING PAPER THAT WE COATED WITH STICKY GLUE.
utt_0060 utt 287.86 293.98 -X THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SPOOLS IS THE FUNCTIONAL LAYER THAT CONSISTS OF MATERIALS LIKE ULTRA-THIN CONDUCTIVE FABRICS.
utt_0062 utt 293.98 297.53 -X MOST SPOOL MATERIALS ARE FABRICATED WITH A VINYL- OR LASER CUTTER,
utt_0063 utt 297.53 303.80 -X BUT AS WE WILL SEE LATER IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE ROLLABLE PRINTED ELECTRONIC OR SANDWICHED MATERIALS.
utt_0064 utt 305.21 310.01 -X THE LAST ADHESIVE LAYER IS MADE OF FUSIBLE WEB THAT IS BONDED WITH THE FUNCTIONAL LAYER.
utt_0065 utt 310.42 314.97 -X WE TRANSFERRED ALL DESIGNS TO THE CARRIER LAYER AND ROLLED IT ONTO SPOOLS.
utt_0066 utt 317.18 319.93 -X BUT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE RAPID IRON-ON TOOL?
utt_0067 utt 319.93 323.61 -X LET US START BY LOOKING AT THE FABRICATION OF TRACES AND CIRCUITS.
utt_0068 utt 324.76 332.54 -X WORKING WITH TRACES AND CIRCUITS HAD TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE ACTION INCLUDING CREATING, CONNECTING, BRIDGING OR DELETING TRACES.
utt_0070 utt 332.95 342.62 -X ON THE OTHER SIDE, THEY REQUIRE SPECIAL PROPERTIES LIKE A GOOD CONNECTIVITY, AN EASY ARRANGEMENT AND SPECIAL SHIELDING, STRETCHABLE AND MULTI-LAYER PROPERTIES –
utt_0072 utt 342.81 350.65 -X WOW, THIS IS LOT, BUT LET US SEE HOW WE CAN TACKLE THIS CHALLENGES WITH THE RAPID IRON-ON APPROACH!
utt_0073 utt 350.65 357.89 -X WE FABRICATED DIFFERENT TRACE SPOOLS INCLUDING STANDARD TRACES AS WELL AS STRETCHABLE ONES IN DIFFERENT SIZES.
utt_0074 utt 358.78 362.09 -X STANDARD TRACES CONSIST OF HIGH-CONDUCTIVE FABRIC
utt_0075 utt 362.17 367.61 -X WITH A THICKNESS OF one hundred and ten MICRONS AND HAVE A PITCH OF A FIFTH OF AN INCH.
utt_0076 utt 368.86 376.25 -X TO FINISH THE SKETCHING PROCESS, THE DESIGNER CAN PUSH A BUTTON TO CUT THE TRACE WITH AN ACTUATED BLADE THAT WE INTEGRATED INTO THE TOOL.
utt_0078 utt 377.27 383.45 -X IN ADDITION, WE EXPLORE HOW COMMERCIAL ELASTIC RIBBONS CAN BE USED WITH OUR RAPID IRON-ON DISPENSER TOOL
utt_0079 utt 383.90 392.77 -X AS WELL AS DESIGN AND FABRICATE OUR OWN ULTRA-THIN, STRETCHABLE TRACE BY COMBINING A HORSE-SHOE PATTERN WITH HIGH-CONDUCTIVE FABRICS.
utt_0081 utt 394.56 399.81 -X FURTHERMORE, WE INTRODUCE SHIELDED TRACES THAT CONSISTS OF A CONDUCTIVE OUTER SHIELD
utt_0082 utt 400.06 404.13 -X AND A CORE TRACE THAT IS SANDWICHED BY TWO ISOLATION TAPES.
utt_0083 utt 405.95 411.58 -X THE WHOLE TAPE IS JUST three hundred and fifty MICRONS THICK AND VERY FLEXIBLE.
utt_0084 utt 411.58 414.78 -X NEXT, I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HOW TRACES CAN BE CONNECTED.
utt_0085 utt 415.10 422.18 -X SINGLE-WIRE TRACES CAN BE CONNECTED QUITE EASILY BY CREATING A NEW ONE ON TOP THAT OVERLAPS WITH AN EXISTING ONE.
utt_0087 utt 422.43 428.38 -X THE GREAT THING HERE IS, THAT CONNECTIONS DID NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE OVERALL RESISTANCE
utt_0088 utt 428.41 430.98 -X AS WE HAVE SHOWN IN TECHNICAL EXPERIMENTS.
utt_0089 utt 430.98 434.94 -X MULTI-WIRE TRACES CAN BE EXTENDED IN THE SAME DIRECTION.
utt_0090 utt 434.94 440.16 -X BUT HOW TO REALIZE ANGLES AND CROSSING FOR MULTI-WIRE TRACES?
utt_0091 utt 440.16 444.13 -X IF A USER WANTS TO ATTACH AN ANGLED CONNECTION TO EXISTING TRACES,
utt_0092 utt 444.16 450.34 -X A CONNECTOR STENCIL COULD BE PLACED ABOVE, IRONED-ON BY USING OUR TOOL IN IRONING MODE,
utt_0093 utt 450.81 454.02 -X AND FINALIZED BY PEELING OFF ITS PROTECTION LAYER.
utt_0094 utt 457.63 462.02 -X IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE SKETCHING THE DESIGNER HAD TO INSERT A TRACE SPOOL
utt_0095 utt 462.69 467.78 -X AND CHECK WHETHER THE AXIS MOVE CORRECTLY.
utt_0096 utt 467.78 471.65 -X NEXT, THE USER CAN PLACE AND ALIGN THE TOOL AND CONTINUE SKETCHING.
utt_0097 utt 474.72 481.06 -X AS A RESULT, ALL TRACES ARE BRIDGED BUILDING A HIGH CONDUCTIVE CONNECTION.
utt_0100 utt 489.69 492.71 -X BASED ON OUR RAPID IRON-ON FABRICATION APPROACH,
utt_0101 utt 492.71 498.21 -X WE INTRODUCE A CONNECTION ZIPPER THAT CAN BE USED AS A MULTI-TRACE CONNECTOR TO PHYSICALLY BRIDGE TRACES.
utt_0102 utt 498.21 503.56 -X THEREFORE, THE DESIGNER CAN LITERALLY IRON THE TRACES TO THE TEETH OF THE ZIPPERS.
utt_0103 utt 504.45 515.04 -X ZIP-ON CONNECTIONS CAN BE USEFUL AS EXCHANGEABLE MECHANISM FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES LIKE DETACHING ELECTRONICS PARTS BEFORE WASHING OR CHANGING MODULES DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT.
utt_0105 utt 516.03 521.57 -X IN ADDITION TO THE CONDUCTIVE FABRIC, WE ALSO EXPLORED HOW OTHER MATERIAL SPOOLS CAN BE USED,
utt_0106 utt 521.82 525.54 -X FOR EXAMPLE, FOR BUILDING A CUSTOM PRESSURE-TOUCH SENSING MATRIX.
utt_0107 utt 526.34 529.83 -X THEREFORE, THE DESIGNER FIRST HAD TO SKETCH SENSING ROWS
utt_0108 utt 530.59 535.88 -X AND THEN CHANGE THE MATERIAL SPOOL TO PIEZOELECTRIC FABRIC AND SKETCH AGAIN ABOVE.
utt_0109 utt 537.57 541.06 -X TO FINALIZE THE SENSOR A LAST TRACE LAYER IS APPLIED.
utt_0110 utt 542.21 548.29 -X THE RESULT IS A CUSTOM-SHAPED FOUR BY FOUR PRESSURE-SENSITIVE MATRIX THAT WORKS VIA RESISTIVE SENSING.
utt_0111 utt 549.35 554.76 -X AS COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES, OUR APPROACH SUPPORTS THE ARRANGEMENT OF DIFFERENT SPOOL SIDE-BY-SIDE,
utt_0112 utt 555.27 558.47 -X AND LAYERING OF TAPES AND PATCHES,
utt_0113 utt 558.47 561.45 -X AS WELL AS THE UTILIZATION OF TEXTILE ACCESSORIES.
utt_0114 utt 561.95 564.74 -X SO FAR, WE HAVE LEARNED TO MANAGE WIRING, RIGHT?
utt_0115 utt 564.74 568.52 -X BUT WHAT ABOUT FURTHER INPUT, OUTPUT AND COMPUTING COMPONENTS?
utt_0116 utt 569.19 580.68 -X WITH OUR WORK, WE ALSO INTRODUCED A COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY OF COMPONENTS WHICH ARE MOSTLY REALIZED AS FUNCTIONAL PATCHES TO BE IRONED ON IN THE SAME MANNER.
utt_0118 utt 580.68 588.13 -X THEREFORE, WE EXPLORE HOW THE VERSATILITY OF AVAILABLE FLEXIBLE COMPONENTS CAN BE MADE READY-TO-USE FOR THE RAPID IRON-ON APPROACH.
utt_0120 utt 588.16 592.97 -X IN THE FOLLOWING, I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS SELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH CLASS.
utt_0121 utt 593.92 600.58 -X SO AS BASIC TOUCH INPUT WE FABRICATED READY-TO-USE CAPACITIVE INPUT CONTROLS INCLUDING BUTTONS AND SLIDERS.
utt_0122 utt 600.64 604.68 -X THEY CAN BE SIMPLY PLACED AND IRONED.
utt_0123 utt 604.68 613.45 -X FURTHERMORE, OUR LIBRARY ALSO INCLUDES PRE-FABRICATED PRESSURE AND BEND SENSORS THAT ARE MADE OF A STACK OF CONDUCTIVE AND PIEZOELECTRIC FABRIC.
utt_0125 utt 614.66 621.03 -X IN ADDITION, A DESIGNER CAN PLACE AN IDENTIFICATION PATCH, THEN IRON THE TAG USING OUR RAPID IRON-ON TOOL
utt_0126 utt 621.09 624.17 -X AND FINALLY PEEL OF THE PROTECTION LAYER.
utt_0127 utt 624.17 630.38 -X THE RESULT IS A FLEXIBLE AND STRONGLY CONNECTED TAG THAT COULD BE USED, FOR INSTANCE, INSIDE A LAB COAT FOR ACCESS CONTROL.
utt_0129 utt 634.85 639.94 -X BUT HOW CAN WE IRON MORE RIGID SEMI-FLEX ELECTRONICS LIKE THIS SMD-LED TAPE?
utt_0130 utt 641.48 645.22 -X WE FABRICATED DIFFERENT IRONS WITH UNIQUE CUT OUTS.
utt_0131 utt 645.54 650.99 -X IF WE LOOK, FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE U-SHAPED IRON, IT IS POSSIBLE TO AVOID CONTACT WITH THE SMALL LEDS
utt_0132 utt 651.33 654.51 -X AND ONLY IRON THE EDGES OF THE TAPE.
utt_0133 utt 654.51 658.06 -X THIS TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US TO IRON-ON SMD-LED TAPES.
utt_0134 utt 659.56 663.95 -X FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO HAVE RESISTIVE HEATING PATCHES AND TAPES.
utt_0135 utt 664.61 671.34 -X IN ORDER TO SUPPORT COMPUTING COMPONENTS, WE COMBINE FLEXIBLE SOLAR CELLS WITH FUSIBLE WEB TO MAKE IT IRON ABLE.
utt_0137 utt 671.40 676.01 -X THE TAPE IS CUTTABLE AT ANY POSITION AND PROVIDE ENOUGH POWER TO CHARGE A BATTERY.
utt_0138 utt 677.19 680.52 -X TO SEE HOW THE TOOLKIT WORKS FOR REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS,
utt_0139 utt 680.55 683.34 -X WE ALSO REALIZED THREE APPLICATION EXAMPLES.
utt_0140 utt 683.34 688.78 -X OUR FIRST ONE IS A SMART CUFF BUTTON THAT ACTS AS A DIRECT AND DISCREET INPUT DEVICE,
utt_0141 utt 688.78 692.36 -X FOR EXAMPLE, FOR CONTROLLING A SLIDE DECK DURING A BUSINESS PRESENTATION.
utt_0142 utt 692.77 697.18 -X THE INTERACTIVE METAL BUTTON CAN BE SLIGHTLY DISPLACED IN ALL DIRECTIONS
utt_0143 utt 697.19 701.26 -X AND SNAPS BACK ELASTICALLY, WHILE SENSING ITS POSITION.
utt_0144 utt 701.26 709.16 -X TECHNICALLY, WE USED A CAPACITIVE FOUR-WAY SLIDER BUTTON PATCH THAT WE IRONED UNDER A CUFF METAL BUTTON.
utt_0146 utt 709.16 716.43 -X FURTHERMORE, WE IRONED AN E-INK DISPLAY AND A NFC TAG ON A DOCTOR’S WHITE COAT PROVIDING ACCESS AND PAGER NOTIFICATIONS.
utt_0148 utt 716.65 724.20 -X THIS EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES HOW ADVANCED ELECTRONICS CAN BE INTEGRATED ONTO TEXTILES.
utt_0149 utt 724.20 728.75 -X FINALLY, WE REALIZED AN INTERACTIVE MESSENGER BAG WITH SOLAR TAPES AT THE STRAP.
utt_0150 utt 729.13 733.29 -X THE BAGS’ INSIDE LIGHTS UP IF SOMEONE OPENS IT.
utt_0151 utt 733.29 736.36 -X THEREFORE, WE USED A BEND SENSOR AND A LED TAPE.
utt_0152 utt 737.03 743.95 -X IN ADDITION, WE INTEGRATED A MOISTURE SENSOR AT THE BAGS BOTTOM TO SENSE WHETHER A BOTTLE LEAKS.
utt_0153 utt 743.95 749.55 -X FINALLY, A MUSIC PLAYER CONTROL MADE OF CAPACITIVE TOUCH WIDGETS IS INTEGRATED AT THE SHOULDER PAD.
utt_0154 utt 749.77 754.41 -X THE MICROCONTROLLER CAN BE ZIPPED-OFF TO REUSE IT IN OTHER CONTEXTS.
utt_0155 utt 756.20 762.51 -X SO, AFTER WE HAVE SEEN THE TOOLKIT IN ACTION, I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THREE EXPERT REVIEWS THAT WE CONDUCTED.
utt_0156 utt 762.51 767.98 -X IN ORDER TO SPEAK WITH TEXTILE AND FASHION DESIGN EXPERTS WE DROVE TO A FRENCH DESIGN UNIVERSITY,
utt_0157 utt 767.98 772.05 -X PHYSICALLY PRESENTED OUR TOOLKIT AND CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS.
utt_0158 utt 772.71 785.23 -X IN ADDITION, WE ALSO VISITED A TEXTILE MACHINERY RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN GERMANY WHERE WE ASKED A MACHINERY &AMP FIBER EXPERT TO TEST AND REVIEW THE RAPID IRON-ON APPROACH IN AN INTERACTIVE HANDS-ON SESSION.
utt_0160 utt 785.23 787.31 -X EACH INTERVIEW TOOK AROUND sixty MINUTES.
utt_0161 utt 789.00 791.82 -X THE TEXTILE AND FASHION EXPERTS STATE THAT
utt_0162 utt 791.88 799.44 -X “THE IRON-ON ROLL &AMP PATCH APPROACH IS IN-BETWEEN LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION AND MANUAL CRAFTING – THIS MAKES ABSOLUTELY SENSE”
utt_0163 utt 799.66 804.69 -X HOWEVER, THEY HAVE ALSO CONCERNS ABOUT ADDING TAPES AND PATCHES SINCE THEY THINK THAT IT IS
utt_0164 utt 804.84 811.92 -X “IMPORTANT TO WORK FROM THE BEGINNING WITH FINAL MATERIALS TO CONSIDER THE VISUAL AND SENSORY QUALITIES IN THE WHOLE DESIGN PROCESS.”
utt_0165 utt 812.59 818.58 -X IN ADDITION, THE MACHINERY AND FIBER EXPERT COMPARED THE RAPID IRON-ON APPROACH WITH OTHER E-TEXTILE SOLUTIONS.
utt_0167 utt 818.73 825.30 -X HE STATED THAT THE PRODUCTION TIME, REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS COSTS ARE CLEAR ADVANTAGES,
utt_0168 utt 825.30 827.31 -X THE SCOPE OF FUNCTIONALITY IS COMPARABLE
utt_0169 utt 827.40 831.54 -X AND THE DURABILITY AND DEGREE OF INTEGRATION IS LESS GOOD.
utt_0170 utt 833.07 845.62 -X SO, LET US CONCLUDE, WITH OUR WORK RAPID IRON-ON USER INTERFACES WE PRESENTED A NOVEL FABRICATION APPROACH FOR INTERACTIVE TEXTILE PROTOTYPES THAT ALLOWS TO ENHANCE FABRICS WITH RICH DIGITAL FUNCTIONALITIES.
utt_0172 utt 845.71 852.94 -X THEREFORE, WE DEVELOPED A HANDHELD IRONING TOOL THAT DIRECTLY TRANSFERS ADHESIVE FUNCTIONAL TAPES AND PATCHES ONTO FABRICS.
utt_0174 utt 852.94 857.71 -X WITH OUR COMPREHENSIVE LIBRARY OF COMPONENTS, WE DEMONSTRATED THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY
utt_0175 utt 857.87 859.92 -X AND ITS WIDESPREAD APPLICABILITY.
utt_0176 utt 860.49 871.54 -X WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED APPLICATIONS FOR UBIQUITOUS AND WEARABLE COMPUTING AND REPORTED FINDINGS FROM EXPERT REVIEWS THAT IDENTIFIED BENEFITS, LIMITATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE WORK.
utt_0178 utt 871.85 878.77 -X AS A NEXT STEP, WE PLAN TO RUN WORKSHOPS IN DESIGN SCHOOLS AND MAKER SPACES TO INVESTIGATE ADOPTION AND USAGE PRACTICE.
utt_0180 utt 880.17 886.42 -X THANK YOU FOR WATCHING OUR PRESENTATION AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER IT VIA MAIL.
utt_0181 utt 886.42 891.95 -4.6527 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR PROJECT PAGE.
