utt_0000 utt 0.68 3.50 -X HI, EVERYONE. MY NAME IS GENTA YOSHIMURA.
utt_0001 utt 4.08 10.16 -X I'M A RESEARCHER AT AIST AND MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION IN JAPAN. TODAY,
utt_0002 utt 10.16 18.80 -X I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MY SOLUTION AT THE KDD CUP two thousand and twenty-one MULTI-DATASET TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION.
utt_0003 utt 18.80 26.80 -X THIS PRESENTATION HAS FOUR PARTS. FIRST, I'LL INTRODUCE THE PROBLEM SETTING OF THE COMPETITION.
utt_0004 utt 26.80 40.47 -X SECOND, I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN AN OVERVIEW OF MY SOLUTION. THIRD, I'M GOING TO LOOK AT SOME ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTIONS FOR DETECTING ANOMALIES. FINALLY, I'LL FINISH WITH A BRIEF SUMMARY.
utt_0006 utt 42.00 49.27 -X LET ME START WITH THE INTRODUCTION. IN THIS COMPETITION, A TOTAL OF two hundred and fifty DATASETS WERE
utt_0007 utt 49.52 58.02 -X PROVIDED. FOR EACH DATASET, A REAL-VALUED UNIVARIATE TIME SERIES X OF LENGTH T AND
utt_0008 utt 58.02 72.98 -X THE LOCATION T_zero TO SPLIT X INTO TRAIN AND TEST DATA ARE GIVEN. FOR EVALUATION, THE GROUND TRUTH LOCATION OF ANOMALY IS GIVEN AS AN INTERVAL, WHICH WAS UNKNOWN DURING THE COMPETITION.
utt_0010 utt 74.07 80.18 -X THIS ASSUMES THAT EVERY TIME SERIES HAS EXACTLY ONE ANOMALY IN THE TEST DATA.
utt_0011 utt 80.98 92.49 -X YOU WILL GET ONE POINT IF THE IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES LOCATION T_HAT IS WITHIN THE GROUND TRUTH INTERVAL WITH MARGINS ON BOTH SIDES. THE GOAL OF THE
utt_0013 utt 92.49 98.46 -X COMPETITION IS TO PRODUCE A SINGLE ALGORITHM THAT CAN FIND THE ANOMALIES OF ALL DATASETS.
utt_0014 utt 100.63 115.61 -X NEXT, I'M GOING TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF MY SOLUTION. IT'S A QUITE SIMPLE ALGORITHM BECAUSE ITS PROCEDURE HAS ONLY TWO STEPS. IN STEP one, IT COMPUTES MULTIPLE NON-NEGATIVE ANOMALY SCORES.
utt_0016 utt 116.02 123.58 -X IN STEP two, IT SELECTS THE ANOMALY SCORE WITH THE MOST PROMINENT PEAK. IN THE NEXT TWO SLIDES
utt_0017 utt 123.58 132.31 -X I'LL DESCRIBE THE DETAIL OF PROCESS IN EACH STEP. STEP one CONSISTS OF TWO PHASES. FIRST,
utt_0018 utt 132.31 139.48 -X SUBSEQUENCES IN THE TEST DATA ARE QUANTIFIED INTO ANOMALY SCORES USING A SLIDING WINDOW.
utt_0019 utt 140.31 148.06 -X ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTION F RETURNS A NON-NEGATIVE ANOMALY SCORE Y_T FOR A SUBSEQUENCE OF LENGTH W.
utt_0020 utt 149.21 154.08 -X TO DEAL WITH VARIOUS LENGTHS AND TYPES OF ANOMALIES IN THE DATASETS,
utt_0021 utt 155.10 161.18 -X I TRIED thirty-two DIFFERENT WINDOW LENGTHS W AND eleven DIFFERENT ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTIONS F.
utt_0022 utt 162.07 166.33 -X I'LL SHOW YOU SOME DETAILED EXAMPLES OF ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTIONS LATER.
utt_0023 utt 168.06 176.38 -X THEN, THE ANOMALY SCORES ARE SMOOTHED USING A MOVING AVERAGE. THIS REDUCES NOISE OF ANOMALY
utt_0024 utt 176.38 183.84 -X SCORES TO IMPROVE THE STABILITY OF ANOMALY DETECTION. IN THIS WAY, I OBTAIN A SCORE S_T
utt_0025 utt 184.25 190.78 -X THAT REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE ANOMALY SCORE WITHIN THE OPEN INTERVAL FROM T-W TO T+W.
utt_0026 utt 194.11 202.59 -X STEP two ALSO CONSISTS OF TWO PHASES. FIRST, A PROMINENCE IS COMPUTED FOR EACH ANOMALY SCORE S.
utt_0027 utt 203.58 210.24 -X THE PROMINENCE IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE FIRST PEAK TO THE SECOND PEAK IN THE TEST DATA.
utt_0028 utt 211.20 218.11 -X BECAUSE OF THE ASSUMPTION THAT EVERY TIME SERIES HAS EXACTLY ONE ANOMALY IN THE TEST DATA,
utt_0029 utt 218.49 223.43 -X THE LARGER THE PROMINENCE, THE MORE APPROPRIATE THE ANOMALY SCORE.
utt_0030 utt 225.73 239.59 -X AFTER COMPUTING THE PROMINENCE OF ALL ANOMALY SCORES, THE ANOMALY SCORE THAT MAXIMIZES THE PROMINENCE IS SELECTED. FINALLY, THE FIRST PEAK LOCATION OF THIS ANOMALY SCORE
utt_0032 utt 239.68 247.30 -X IS DETECTED AS AN ANOMALY LOCATION. HERE YOU SEE A LIST OF eleven DIFFERENT ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTIONS
utt_0033 utt 247.49 255.30 -X USED IN MY SOLUTION. I'LL EXPLAIN THREE ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTIONS PAINTED IN LIGHT BLUE IN THE NEXT
utt_0034 utt 255.30 262.92 -X THREE SLIDES. LET ME BEGIN WITH THE SIMPLEST ANOMALY SCORE FUNCTION. A PEAK TO PEAK VALUE
utt_0035 utt 262.92 270.92 -X REPRESENTS THE AMPLITUDE OF A SUBSEQUENCE. IT CAN BE COMPUTED EFFICIENTLY BY TAKING THE DIFFERENCE
utt_0036 utt 270.92 279.72 -X BETWEEN THE ROLLING MAX AND MIN. I COMPUTED IT NOT ONLY FOR THE ORIGINAL TIME SERIES X, BUT ALSO FOR
utt_0037 utt 279.72 287.69 -X THE FIRST- AND SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENCE OF X .THESE FUNCTIONS CAN DETECT ANOMALIES WHERE THE POSITION,
utt_0038 utt 287.69 296.39 -X VELOCITY, OR ACCELERATION IS LOCALLY LARGE. NEXT I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN THE SECOND SCORE FUNCTION
utt_0039 utt 296.39 303.69 -X NAMED MATRIX PROFILE (MP), WHICH IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR TIME SERIES DATA MINING.
utt_0040 utt 303.69 310.92 -X THE MP IS DEFINED AS THE Z-NORMALIZED EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE TO THE CLOSEST SUBSEQUENCE.
utt_0041 utt 310.92 325.67 -X IN THIS EQUATION, ALL SUBSEQUENCES WITHIN THE TEST DATA ARE COMPARED TO ALL SUBSEQUENCES IN THE TRAINING DATA. THIS IS REFERRED TO AS AN AB-JOIN AND CAN BE USED FOR THE NOVELTY DETECTION.
utt_0043 utt 326.85 334.03 -X I ALSO COMPUTED A SELF-JOIN FOR THE OUTLIER DETECTION, WHERE ALL SUBSEQUENCES WITHIN THE
utt_0044 utt 334.03 343.08 -X TRAINING AND TEST DATA ARE COMPARED WITH ITSELF. THERE ARE SEVERAL ALGORITHMS FOR COMPUTING THE MP
utt_0045 utt 343.08 350.70 -X EFFICIENTLY. IN THIS COMPETITION, I USED STUMPY, WHICH IS A POWERFUL AND SCALABLE PYTHON LIBRARY.
utt_0046 utt 351.50 359.53 -X ALTHOUGH THE MP IS A PROMISING ANOMALY SCORE, IN SOME CASES, THE MP VALUES OF NORMAL SUBSEQUENCES
utt_0047 utt 359.56 364.84 -X BECOME LARGE, WHICH LEADS TO FALSE DETECTION OF THE NORMAL SUBSEQUENCE.
utt_0048 utt 366.18 372.30 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PROBLEM ARISES WHEN THE NOISE IN THE NORMAL TIME SERIES IS LARGE.
utt_0049 utt 373.93 381.63 -X TO DEAL WITH THIS, I PROPOSED A NOVEL ANOMALY SCORE WHICH I CALL NORMALIZED MATRIX PROFILE
utt_0050 utt 381.80 396.46 -X (NMP). THE MP VALUE D_T IS DIVIDED BY A NORMALIZATION FACTOR Z_T, WHICH IS A Z-NORMALIZED EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE FROM THE CLOSEST SUBSEQUENCE TO ITS CLOSEST SUBSEQUENCE.
utt_0052 utt 397.96 402.86 -X THE NMP IS INSPIRED BY THE LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR CONCEPT.
utt_0053 utt 403.69 410.29 -X THE CURRENT DEFINITION CORRESPONDS TO THE SIMPLIFIED-LOF WITH THE NUMBER OF NEIGHBORS K=one.
utt_0054 utt 413.07 426.61 -X THIS IS A SHORT SUMMARY OF MY PRESENTATION. I PROPOSED A SIMPLE TWO-STEP TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION ALGORITHM. IT ACHIEVED A HIGH ANOMALY DETECTION PERFORMANCE.
utt_0056 utt 426.93 435.17 -X IN ADDITION THERE ARE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES IN THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM. FIRST, IT IS REPRODUCIBLE
utt_0057 utt 435.31 443.22 -X BECAUSE IT DOES NOT NEED PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBERS AT ALL, AND IS COMPLETELY DETERMINISTIC.
utt_0058 utt 443.22 446.42 -X SECOND, IT IS SCALABLE FOR THE LARGE TIME SERIES.
utt_0059 utt 447.60 452.60 -X ALTHOUGH COMPUTING MATRIX PROFILES CAN BE A COMPUTATIONAL BOTTLENECK,
utt_0060 utt 452.72 462.32 -X IT CAN BE ACCELERATED BY GPU OR DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING. THIRD, IT IS INTERPRETABLE BECAUSE
utt_0061 utt 462.32 469.11 -X IT CAN PROVIDE HINTS ABOUT THE LENGTH AND TYPE OF ANOMALY BY RETURNING THE SELECTED W AND F.
utt_0062 utt 471.25 484.89 -X FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE HOSTS FOR ORGANIZING SUCH A GREAT COMPETITION. I'M SURE THAT THIS COMPETITION WILL BRING GREAT PROGRESS IN TIME SERIES ANOMALY DETECTION RESEARCH.
utt_0064 utt 486.42 490.33 -3.1926 THAT IS ALL I WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
