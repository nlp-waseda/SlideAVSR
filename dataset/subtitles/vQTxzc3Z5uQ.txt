utt_0014 utt 67.19 78.63 -X ADAPTIVE INSTANCE AWARE RESAMPLING FOR MULTI-VIEW threeD DETECTION CAMERA-BASED threeD OBJECT DETECTION HAS EARNED A WIDE AUDIENCE DUE TO THE LOW COST FOR DEPLOYMENT AND ADVANTAGES FOR LONG-RANGE DETECTION
utt_0016 utt 79.12 84.20 -X RECENTLY MULTI-VIEW threeD OBJECT DETECTION IN BIRD'S EYE VIEW HAS MADE FAST PROGRESS
utt_0017 utt 84.72 95.21 -X DUE TO THE UNIFIED REPRESENTATION IN threeD SPACE MULTI-VIEW FEATURES AND TEMPORAL INFORMATION CAN BE FUSED CONVENIENTLY WHICH LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT OVER MONOCULAR METHODS

utt_0022 utt 110.91 122.04 -X THE BIRD'S EYE VIEW IS THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF MODERN BEV threeD DETECTORS SO HOW TO TRANSFORM VIEW FEATURE CURRENT METHODS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO SCHEMES twoD LIFT threeD AND threeD QUERY twoD
utt_0024 utt 124.82 136.08 -X THE TRANSFORMATION OF FEATURES FROM twoD PERSPECTIVE SPACE TO threeD SPACE IS ESSENTIAL TO MULTIVIEW threeD OBJECT DETECTION RECENT APPROACHES MAINLY FOCUS ON THE DESIGN OF VIEW TRANSFORMATION

utt_0032 utt 164.79 174.97 -X WE PROPOSE A NOVEL FRAMEWORK NAMED FROST AND FORMER WHICH PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO THE FEATURES IN INSTANCE REGIONS VIA ADAPTIVE INSTANCE AWARE RESAMPLING AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE FROST AND
utt_0034 utt 174.97 186.40 -X FORMER IS COMPOSED OF FOUR COMPONENTS AN IMAGE BACKBONE FRUSTUM ENCODER FRUSTUM FUSION MODULE AND A DETECTION HEAD OUR CORE DESIGN LIES IN THE FRUSTUM ENCODER AND FRUSTUM FUSION WHICH EXPLOITS

utt_0037 utt 191.45 201.91 -X INSTEAD OF TREATING ALL REGIONS EQUALLY DURING THE FEATURE VIEW TRANSFORMATION OUR FRUSTUM ENCODER ADAPTIVELY TRANSFORMS THE IMAGE FEATURES ACCORDING TO THE VIEW CONTENT WE ADOPT TWO TYPES
utt_0039 utt 201.91 212.31 -X OF QUERIES TO TRANSFORM THE BEV FEATURE INSTANCE QUERIES ARE SPARSE AND IRREGULAR FOCUSING MORE ON INSTANCE REGIONS WHILE SCENE QUERIES ARE DENSE AND REGULAR LEARNING GLOBAL CONTEXT INFORMATION
utt_0041 utt 212.77 223.36 -X THE LEARNING PROCESS OF THE SCENE QUERY IS SIMILAR TO BV FORMER HOWEVER THE INSTANCE QUERIES ARE LEARNED INSIDE INSTANCE REGIONS AND THE LEARNED INSTANCE FEATURE IS FURTHER COMBINED WITH THE

utt_0046 utt 240.93 249.97 -X THE SELECTION OF INSTANCE QUERIES IS MADE VIA ADAPTIVE INSTANCE AWARE RESAMPLING WHICH CONSISTS OF INSTANCE FRUSTUM QUERY GENERATION AND FRUSTUM OCCUPANCY MASK PREDICTION
utt_0048 utt 250.50 259.99 -X IN INSTANCE FRUSTUM QUERY GENERATION WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OBJECT DETECTION ON THE IMAGE PLANE AND LEVERAGE ITS INSTANCE FRUSTUM ON THE BEV PLANE TO SELECT THE INSTANCE FRUSTUM QUERIES
utt_0050 utt 260.51 268.87 -X ALTHOUGH THE INSTANCE FIRST AND PROVIDES POTENTIAL LOCATIONS FOR OBJECTS ITS CORRESPONDING AREA ON THE BEV PLANE IS OFTEN LARGE DUE TO DEPTH UNCERTAINTY
utt_0052 utt 269.32 274.78 -X TO REDUCE THE LOCALIZATION UNCERTAINTY WE PROPOSE TO PREDICT AN OCCUPANCY MASK FOR ALL FRUSTUMS
utt_0053 utt 275.27 280.90 -X THE OCCUPANCY MASK CAN GET SUPERVISION FROM THE PROJECTION OF threeD BOUNDING BOXES ON THE BEV PLANE
utt_0054 utt 281.60 290.42 -X WE DEFINE INSTANCE FRUSTUM CROSS ATTENTION TO COMPUTE INSTANCE FEATURES BETWEEN INSTANCE QUERIES AND IMAGE FEATURES AND TEMPORAL FRUSTUM CROSS ATTENTION FOR TEMPORAL FUSION
utt_0056 utt 290.88 302.49 -X WE ADOPT A SEQUENTIAL RNN WAY TO FUSE THE HISTORY BEV FEATURES COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE NU SCENES DATA SET DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THRUST AND FORMER AND WE ACHIEVE A NEW STATE

utt_0062 utt 324.17 335.02 -X OF INSTANCE AWARE SAMPLING COMPARED WITH B AND C WE FOUND THAT INSTANCE AWARE SAMPLING IS MORE EFFECTIVE SINCE SIMPLY INCREASING THE SAMPLING POINTS FOR ALL REGIONS HAS NO GAIN
utt_0064 utt 335.78 346.03 -X WE ALSO ABLATE THE HYPER PARAMETERS USED IN OCCUPANCY MASK LEARNING AND TEMPORAL FRUSTUM FUSION IT INDICATES THAT LONGER TEMPORAL FUSION WILL IMPROVE DETECTION PERFORMANCE
utt_0066 utt 346.79 352.24 -X WITH ADAPTIVE INSTANCE AWARE RESAMPLING OUR METHOD SHOWS RECALL IMPROVEMENT UNDER LOW VISIBILITY
utt_0067 utt 352.78 364.24 -X WE FOUND THAT THE RECALL FOR CATEGORIES OF BICYCLE TRAILER BUS AND CONSTRUCTION VEHICLE IMPROVED A LOT UNDER THE LOW VISIBILITY SINCE NEARLY twenty-nine OF OBJECTS BELONG TO THE VISIBILITY
utt_0069 utt 364.62 377.10 -X OF zero TO 4zero PERCENT SUCH IMPROVEMENT IS CRUCIAL FOR A BETTER threeD OBJECT DETECTOR WE PROVIDE SOME VISUALIZATIONS FOR THE CASE OF RECALL IMPROVEMENT THE RED CIRCLE INDICATES THE REGION WHERE IT HELPS

utt_0072 utt 382.19 392.80 -X AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE WE ILLUSTRATE THE INSTANCE AWARE SAMPLING POINTS OF OUR METHOD ON BOTH IMAGE VIEW AND BIRD'S EYE VIEW THE SAMPLING POINTS ARE HIGHLY RELATED TO THE INSTANCE REGIONS
utt_0074 utt 393.55 398.48 -X OUR METHOD CAN ALSO BE INTUITIVELY EXPLAINED THROUGH THE HEAT MAPS OF BEV FEATURES
utt_0075 utt 399.05 410.64 -X THE BEV FEATURES LEARNED BY OUR FRUSTUM ENCODER IS INSTANCE AWARE AND HAS STRONG RELATIONS TO THE REAL POSITIONS WE COMPARE THE BEV FEATURE BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND THE BASELINE WITH ADAPTIVE
