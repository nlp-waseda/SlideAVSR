utt_0000 utt 0.81 4.27 -X HI, I'M SARAH FROM IMT NORD EUROPE,
utt_0001 utt 4.27 8.30 -X AND I'M HERE TO PRESENT MY WORK ON ADAPTIVE GAUSSIAN NESTED FILTERS.
utt_0003 utt 8.56 15.33 -X THESE FILTERS BELONG TO THE NESTED METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK AND THEY AIM AT ESTIMATING BOTH THE PARAMETERS
utt_0007 utt 15.44 18.32 -X AND THE STATE OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS.
utt_0008 utt 18.32 21.20 -X THIS IS A JOINT WORK WITH V√çCTOR ELVIRA
utt_0009 utt 21.39 23.82 -X FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH.
utt_0010 utt 25.17 32.15 -X SO AS I SAID, WE ARE INTERESTED IN DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED WITH STATE SPACE MODELS.
utt_0012 utt 32.56 39.79 -X THESE MODELS HAVE TWO RANDOM VARIABLES THAT DESCRIBE THEM: THE STATE X_T AND THE OBSERVATIONS Y_T.
utt_0014 utt 40.43 45.04 -X BOTH ARE USUALLY NOISY AND CAN BE DESCRIBED
utt_0015 utt 45.90 50.19 -X BY A COUPLE OF FUNCTIONS THAT DEPEND ON THE PARAMETER THETA.
utt_0016 utt 51.37 54.39 -X THIS VECTOR IS USUALLY UNKNOWN.
utt_0017 utt 54.39 58.48 -X SO IF WE WANT TO ESTIMATE THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM,
utt_0018 utt 58.57 63.09 -X WE NEED TO ESTIMATE BOTH THE PARAMETERS AND THE STATE.
utt_0019 utt 63.31 69.23 -X THERE ARE A LOT OF APPROACHES THAT TRIED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM,
utt_0020 utt 69.23 73.01 -X BUT IN THE LAST YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN
utt_0021 utt 73.30 84.69 -X SOME NEW METHODS THAT AIM AT ESTIMATING THE JOINT POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH THE UNKNOWN VARIABLES (THE STATE), AND THE PARAMETERS THETA.
utt_0023 utt 85.14 92.98 -X THOSE METHODS BELONG TO THE NESTED METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK AND THEY CAN QUANTIFY THE UNCERTAINTY,
utt_0025 utt 93.07 98.47 -X SO WE CAN MEASURE HOW CERTAIN WE ARE ABOUT OUR ESTIMATES
utt_0026 utt 99.18 104.28 -X THEY CAN BE APPLIED ALSO TO A BROAD CLASS OF MODELS AND FINALLY,
utt_0027 utt 104.28 110.23 -X THEY PROVIDE THEORETICAL GUARANTEES, SO THE CONVERGENCE IS ASSURED.
utt_0028 utt 112.53 118.90 -X THE STRUCTURE OF THIS METHODOLOGY IS A DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER APPROACH.
utt_0029 utt 118.90 122.52 -X IT HAS TWO INTERTWINED LAYERS OF COMPUTATION.
utt_0030 utt 122.71 130.49 -X THE FIRST ONE IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PARAMETERS GIVEN THE OBSERVATIONS,
utt_0032 utt 130.49 132.95 -X AND THE BOTTOM LAYER IS USED TO ESTIMATE
utt_0033 utt 133.07 139.93 -X THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE GIVEN BOTH THE OBSERVATIONS AND THETA.
utt_0034 utt 140.34 148.69 -X AND WITH THESE TWO POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTIONS, WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THE JOINT OF THE PARAMETERS AND THE STATE.
utt_0036 utt 150.96 152.98 -X SO WITHIN THIS STRUCTURE,
utt_0037 utt 152.98 154.36 -X IN THE TOP LAYER,
utt_0038 utt 155.12 159.16 -X WE IMPLEMENT A SAMPLING FILTERING TECHNIQUE.
utt_0039 utt 159.22 169.66 -X SO THIS PREDICTIVE PDF IS GOING TO BE REPRESENTED WITH A SET OF N SAMPLES OF THETA WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE WEIGHTS.
utt_0042 utt 169.84 180.76 -X ONCE WE HAVE THAT, WE CAN RUN OR IMPLEMENT IN THE BOTTOM LAYER N DIFFERENT FILTERS, ONE PER EACH SAMPLE OF THETA.
utt_0044 utt 181.40 184.86 -X SO WE CAN RUN A STANDARD FILTERING TECHNIQUE
utt_0045 utt 187.80 193.30 -X THAT ESTIMATES BOTH THE PREDICTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE AND THE POSTERIOR ONE.
utt_0047 utt 194.13 203.22 -X THE KEY HERE IS THAT IN THIS BOTTOM LAYER WE CAN COMPUTE THE EVALUATION OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EACH SAMPLE OF THETA
utt_0049 utt 203.25 210.68 -X THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED IN THE TOP LAYER FOR THE UPDATE OF THE DISTRIBUTION (OF THE PARAMETERS).
utt_0051 utt 210.68 214.23 -X THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATIONS WITHIN THIS STRUCTURE,
utt_0052 utt 214.52 220.79 -X BUT OUR GOAL WITHIN THIS PAPER IS TO REDUCE THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY
utt_0053 utt 223.41 227.23 -X OF THIS STRUCTURE WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE PERFORMANCE.
utt_0054 utt 227.23 230.52 -X AND FOR THAT PURPOSE, WE ARE GOING TO PLAY
utt_0055 utt 230.77 236.38 -X WITH THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES THAT WE ARE USING IN THE TOP LAYER OF THE FILTER.
utt_0057 utt 238.39 242.04 -X SO WE HAVE PROPOSED THE ADAPTIVE GAUSSIAN NESTED FILTER,
utt_0058 utt 242.04 243.83 -X THAT IS THE FIRST NESTED METHOD
utt_0059 utt 244.02 249.11 -X THAT ADAPTS THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES OF THE TOP LAYER OF THIS STRUCTURE.
utt_0060 utt 249.40 253.59 -X THE ADAPTATION IS ACHIEVED USING TWO NOVEL MECHANISMS.
utt_0061 utt 254.04 264.95 -X THE FIRST ONE IS AN ADAPTIVE RULE THAT REDUCES AUTOMATICALLY THE NUMBER OF POINTS WHEN T GROWS OR WHEN THE PARAMETERS ARE CLOSE TO CONVERGENCE.
utt_0064 utt 265.24 267.90 -X AND THE SECOND ONE IS A RECURSIVE RULE
utt_0065 utt 267.99 273.21 -X THAT DETERMINES WHEN THE FILTERS OF THE BOTTOM LAYER CAN RUN RECURSIVELY.
utt_0066 utt 273.21 279.87 -X SO WE DO NOT NEED TO REPROCESS THE WHOLE SEQUENCE OF OBSERVATIONS.
utt_0067 utt 281.78 285.05 -X FOR THE ADAPTIVE RULE, WE USE A STATISTIC RHO
utt_0068 utt 285.85 292.41 -X THAT IS BUILT WITH THE EVALUATIONS OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EACH THETA SAMPLE.
utt_0070 utt 292.60 301.05 -X SO THIS STATISTIC TAKES ITS MINIMUM VALUE WHEN ONLY ONE OF THESE EVALUATIONS IS DIFFERENT FROM ZERO.
utt_0072 utt 301.05 308.51 -X SO, ONLY ONE OF THE SAMPLES IS ABLE TO GIVE GOOD APPROXIMATIONS OR GOOD ESTIMATES OF THE STATE.
utt_0074 utt 309.91 317.85 -X THE STATISTIC TAKES ITS MAXIMUM VALUE WHEN ALL THE EVALUATIONS ARE EQUAL.
utt_0075 utt 319.39 330.78 -X THIS HAPPENS USUALLY WHEN THE PARAMETERS ARE VERY CLOSE TO CONVERGENCE AND THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION (THAT WE ARE APPROXIMATING)
utt_0077 utt 330.78 331.81 -X GETS VERY NARROW.
utt_0078 utt 331.81 335.26 -X SO ALL THE POINTS ARE VERY CLOSE IN THE PARAMETER SPACE
utt_0079 utt 335.77 340.48 -X AND THEY BASICALLY PROVIDE THE SAME EVALUATIONS
utt_0080 utt 341.63 344.35 -X AND ALMOST THE SAME ESTIMATIONS.
utt_0081 utt 344.35 349.98 -X SO WE MIGHT CONSIDER THAT THE POINTS MIGHT BE REDUNDANT.
utt_0082 utt 349.98 352.86 -X SO IN THE ADAPTIVE RULE, WE CHECK WHEN THIS IS THE CASE,
utt_0083 utt 352.86 355.61 -X WHEN RHO IS VERY CLOSE TO ITS MAXIMUM VALUE,
utt_0084 utt 355.61 358.24 -X WE DECIDE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES.
utt_0085 utt 358.81 363.52 -X OTHERWISE, WE KEEP THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES AS IT WAS.
utt_0086 utt 366.65 372.51 -X AS THE FILTER WAS EXPLAINED, UNTIL NOW, IT'S NOT RECURSIVE.
utt_0087 utt 372.83 377.28 -X EVERY TIME WE MAKE AN UPDATE, IN THE TOP LAYER,
utt_0088 utt 377.28 380.48 -X THE SAMPLES OF THETA ARE RECALCULATED,
utt_0089 utt 380.48 382.56 -X SO THE BOTTOM LAYER FILTERS,
utt_0090 utt 382.56 385.86 -X THE ONES THAT ESTIMATE THE STATE,
utt_0091 utt 387.48 389.76 -X SHOULD HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH.
utt_0092 utt 390.46 393.89 -X IF WE WANT TO MAKE THIS FILTER RECURSIVE,
utt_0093 utt 394.24 404.16 -X WE NEED TO ASSUME THAT THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION OF THE STATE GIVEN THE NEW SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS
utt_0096 utt 404.19 408.74 -X THE POSTERIOR DISTRIBUTION GIVEN THE PREVIOUS SAMPLE OF THETA.
utt_0097 utt 409.53 412.93 -X AND, WHEN IS THIS A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION?
utt_0098 utt 412.93 417.19 -X WHEN CAN WE TAKE THIS APPROXIMATION WITHOUT INTRODUCING TOO MUCH ERROR?
utt_0099 utt 417.98 423.94 -X SO, WE ARE GOING TO COMPUTE THE NORM BETWEEN BOTH SAMPLES,
utt_0100 utt 423.94 425.60 -X THE NEW ONE AND THE PREVIOUS ONE,
utt_0101 utt 426.37 432.03 -X AND WE ARE GOING TO COMPARE THIS NORM AGAINST A PRESCRIBED THRESHOLD LAMBDA.
utt_0102 utt 432.51 434.66 -X IF WE ARE BELOW THIS THRESHOLD,
utt_0103 utt 434.69 438.37 -X WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE APPROXIMATION.
utt_0104 utt 440.57 447.97 -X IF WE ARE NOT, THEN WE ASSUME THIS APPROXIMATION WOULD INTRODUCE TOO MUCH ERROR IN OUR ESTIMATES.
utt_0106 utt 447.97 452.64 -X SO WE START OUR BOTTOM LAYER FILTERS FROM SCRATCH,
utt_0107 utt 452.64 454.82 -X STARTING WITH THE PRIOR OF THE STATE.
utt_0108 utt 455.68 458.91 -X FOR MORE DETAILS, YOU CAN CHECK OUR PAPER,
utt_0109 utt 459.07 462.47 -X YOU CAN SEND ME ANY QUESTIONS BY EMAIL,
utt_0110 utt 462.50 467.27 -X AND, OF COURSE, WE CAN MEET AT THE ICASSP two thousand and twenty-three
utt_0111 utt 468.54 471.68 -X WHERE I'M PRESENTING MY POSTER WITH THIS WORK.
utt_0112 utt 471.68 474.44 -2.7182 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, AND SEE YOU THERE!
