utt_0000 utt 0.45 13.62 -X HELLO MY NAME IS KATERINA GORKOVENKO I AM A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH AND TODAY I WILL BE PRESENTING A RESEARCH STUDY CALLED EXPLORING THE FUTURE OF DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT DESIGN WHICH WAS PUBLISHED AT CHI two thousand and twenty IT IS
utt_0003 utt 14.06 18.29 -X PART OF A LARGER PROJECT CALLED CHATTY FACTORIES, WHICH WAS FUNDED BY THE EPSRC
utt_0004 utt 18.48 25.23 -X AND I WILL BE PRESENTING THE WORK ON BEHALF OF MY CO-AUTHORS DR. DANIEL BARNETT, JAMES THORP, DR. DANIEL RICHARDS AND DR.
utt_0006 utt 25.23 37.78 -X DAVE MARRY-RUST. THE WORK WAS DONE IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITIES OF EDINBURGH AND LANCASTER UNIVERSITY. ONCE RELEASED ONTO THE MARKET PHYSICAL PRODUCTS CAN BE USED IN CONTEXTS AND FOR PURPOSES THAT DESIGNERS MAY NOT HAVE
utt_0009 utt 37.78 50.23 -X ANTICIPATED AND INSIGHTS FROM THESE CONTEXTS CAN BE VERY VALUABLE FOR DESIGN RESEARCH. WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE DATA DRIVEN APPROACHES SUCH AS THOSE USED WITHIN THE DIGITAL PRODUCTS SPHERE SUCH AS A/B TESTING AND ANALYTICS
utt_0012 utt 50.77 55.09 -X AROUND IOT PRODUCTS AND CONNECTED DEVICES. THIS WORK AIMS TO MAP THE
utt_0013 utt 55.21 65.01 -X SPACE OF CHOICES AVAILABLE TO DESIGN TEAMS AND IT WAS DONE THROUGH A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS. THERE IS A DRIVE WITH AN INDUSTRY TO MAKE USE OF DATA
utt_0015 utt 65.01 76.69 -X COLLECTED FROM THE WILD AND IT HAS AN IMPACT ON MAINTENANCE, HOWEVER IT HAS A LIMITED REPORTED IMPACT ON DESIGN MORE SPECIFICALLY. IN CONTRAST, WITHIN THE
utt_0017 utt 76.69 85.24 -X FIELD OF HCI WE SEE DATA COLLECTION FROM PRODUCTS IN THE WILD AS QUITE COMMONPLACE FOR DESIGN RESEARCH, AND EXAMPLES OF THIS IS CONTINGENCIES
utt_0019 utt 85.24 97.17 -X EXPERIENCE SAMPLING WHERE TRIGGERS FROM DATA ARE USED TO GENERATE RESPONSE REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPANTS, OR ETHNO-MINING AND THING ETHNOGRAPHY WHERE COLLECTED
utt_0021 utt 97.17 107.65 -X DATA IN THE FIELD SUPPORTS CONTEXTUAL INQUIRY, AND DATA ENABLED DESIGN WHERE TECHNOLOGY PROBES COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA ALONGSIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA IN
utt_0023 utt 107.65 119.28 -X ORDER TO SUPPORT DESIGN RESEARCH, HOWEVER THERE ARE ISSUES WITH IMPLEMENTING THESE RESEARCH METHODS WITHIN INDUSTRY WHICH IS MORE GENERALLY CRITICIZED FOR
utt_0025 utt 119.28 129.69 -X UTILIZING DATA COLLECTION, WHICH PERPETUATES PRACTICES THAT ARE SEEN TO DISEMPOWER CONSUMERS SUCH AS SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM AND PROSUMPTION.
utt_0027 utt 130.67 140.49 -X TRADITIONAL PHYSICAL PRODUCT DESIGN CYCLES EXTENT THE MOMENT THAT A PRODUCT IS DEPLOYED IN CONTRAST WHEN IT COMES TO DIGITAL PRODUCTS THE DATA COLLECTION IN
utt_0029 utt 140.49 151.54 -X RESEARCH CONTINUES LONG PAST A PRODUCTS IS DEPLOYED ONTO THE MARKET. WITHIN PHYSICAL PRODUCTS DATA HAS BEEN SEEN TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
utt_0031 utt 151.63 162.68 -X DESIGNS SUCH AS IN THE HOVDING HELMET WHERE A SECOND ITERATION OF THE DESIGN WAS GENERATED AFTER THREE THOUSAND STAGE ACCIDENTS AND DATA
utt_0033 utt 162.68 173.46 -X COLLECTED FROM TWO THOUSAND HOURS OF CYCLIST DATA. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF ATTITUDINAL RESEARCH WE CONDUCTED THREE WORKSHOPS WITH thirty-two PARTICIPANTS TOTAL
utt_0035 utt 173.46 186.81 -X FROM INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA WHO REPORTED HAVING EXPERTISE IN THE IOT AND PRODUCT DESIGN EACH WORKSHOP WAS THREE HOURS LONG AND THEY WERE CONDUCTED ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM IN LANCASTER, EDINBURGH, AND LONDON IN ORDER TO RECRUIT A VARIED
utt_0038 utt 186.81 198.74 -X COHORT OF PARTICIPANTS. PARTICIPANTS DID A SERIES OF EXERCISES IN GROUPS OF THREE TO FIVE PEOPLE AND THE EXERCISES WERE CENTERED AROUND LARGE Aone SHEETS OF PAPER
utt_0040 utt 199.03 209.80 -X ON WHICH WE COLLECTED DATA. EACH TABLE HAD AN AUDIO RECORDER ON IT AND THE DATA THAT WE COLLECTED INCLUDED THE AUDIO TRANSCRIPTIONS FROM EACH TABLE AND ALL
utt_0042 utt 209.80 220.76 -X OF THE WRITTEN NOTES FROM THE DIFFERENT GROUPS AND EVERYTHING WAS TRANSCRIBED AND THEMATICALLY ANALYZED. THE WORKSHOP STRUCTURE INCLUDED A DEMO TALKING TO
utt_0044 utt 220.76 229.88 -X OBJECTS SECTION, FUTURE VISION CHALLENGE, IMPLICATIONS, AND DISCUSSION. WITHIN THE DEMO WE PRESENTED WORK THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE WITHIN THE FIELD WHERE
utt_0046 utt 230.58 241.53 -X A CONNECTED BLUETOOTH SPEAKER SENDS DATA TO ITS VIRTUAL REPRESENTATION OR ALSO KNOWN AS A DIGITAL SHADOW OR A DIGITAL TWIN. IN THE NEXT EXERCISE THE TALKING TO
utt_0048 utt 241.53 254.54 -X OBJECTS EXERCISE WE ASK THE PARTICIPANTS TO GENERATE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED THROUGH DATA COLLECTION AROUND AN OBJECT AND AS YOU'LL SEE THROUGHOUT THE SLIDES I HAVE AN IMAGE OF A KETTLE WITH A BUNCH OF STICKY NOTES ON
utt_0051 utt 254.54 264.22 -X IT WHICH WAS GENERATED THROUGH THIS EXERCISE. IN EACH WORKSHOP WE HAD A DIFFERENT OBJECT TO BE ANNOTATED SO IN LANCASTER WE HAD THE KETTLES, IN LONDON
utt_0053 utt 264.22 274.35 -X WE HAD AUDIO RECORDERS, AND THEN WE HAD AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER. AFTER THAT WE HAD THE FUTURE VISION CHALLENGE WHERE PARTICIPANTS SPOKE ABOUT OBJECTS
utt_0055 utt 274.62 287.79 -X PRODUCTS THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON OR THEY IMAGINED AN OBJECT THAT THEY MIGHT BE DESIGNING AND THEN THEY GENERATED A SERIES OF QUESTIONS AROUND THAT THAT COULD BE ANSWERED THROUGH DATA AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM ONE OF OUR
utt_0058 utt 287.79 290.59 -X PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDINBURGH DISCUSSION.
utt_0059 utt 292.34 293.63 -X THIS IS MARTY THE ROBOT.
utt_0060 utt 295.51 298.75 -X IT IS A PROJECT I HAVE BEEN PROTOTYPING AT ROBOTICAL.
utt_0061 utt 298.81 304.03 -X SO WE ARE ACTUALLY UNDERGOING A REVAMP OF THE PRODUCT AT THE MOMENT SO THIS IS QUITE RELEVANT TO DISCUSS IT HERE.
utt_0062 utt 305.37 309.02 -X SO MARTY IS A ROBOT THAT HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT ROBOTICS
utt_0063 utt 310.17 313.31 -X ENGINEERS AND MATHS WITHIN A PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL CONTEXT
utt_0064 utt 313.40 327.74 -X SO THERE ARE NINE MOTORS WITHIN THE ROBOT ROBOT SO ONE IN EACH ARM AND WITHIN THE EYES, AND THERE'S THREE IN EACH OF THE LEGS SO COMMON PLACE WHERE THE ROBOT HAS BEEN BROKEN IN THE PAST IS THIS LEG HERE SO IT TWISTS TO MOVE SO WHAT KIDS ARE DOING IS TWISTING THEM UNTIL THEY BREAK
utt_0067 utt 328.67 330.75 -X SO WHAT WE HAVE IN EACH OF THEM ARE CUSTOM SERVOS
utt_0068 utt 331.83 340.19 -X THAT HAVE PRESSURE MONITORS, SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE FORCE, IT IS ESSENTIALLY A CURRANT SENSOR SO WE CAN COINCIDE HOW MUCH CURRENT IS APPLIED AND HOW MUCH PRESSURE
utt_0070 utt 340.31 347.23 -X SO WE ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THIS ONE IS GETTING BROKEN BECAUSE TOO MUCH PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THIS JOINT SO WE ARE ABLE TO FIX THAT IN THE FUTURE USING PLASTIC FITTINGS.
utt_0072 utt 347.23 351.84 -X AFTERWARDS WE CONDUCTED AN IMPLICATIONS DISCUSSION WHERE THE
utt_0073 utt 352.12 365.44 -X PARTICIPANTS SPOKE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF IMPLEMENTING A DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN APPROACH WITHIN THEIR CURRENT PERSONAL WORK AND FINALLY WE HAD A GROUP DISCUSSION WHERE EVERYONE FROM EACH INDIVIDUAL WORKSHOP CAME TOGETHER
utt_0076 utt 365.44 376.80 -X AND WE SPOKE ABOUT FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT DESIGN MORE GENERALLY, AND FROM ALL OF THE TRANSCRIPTIONS OF NOTES AND AUDIO
utt_0078 utt 376.80 391.07 -X RECORDINGS WE THEMATICALLY ANALYZED THEM AND GENERATED EIGHT THEMES THE KEY FINDINGS IN THE SPACE ARE AROUND LIVE DATA GATHERING GENERATING DESIGN INSIGHT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND REDESIGN, USER CENTRIC DESIGN, SUPPORT AND SERVICE
utt_0081 utt 391.07 405.60 -X PRODUCTS, AND ISSUES. SO THE FIRST THEME THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY IS LIVE DATA GATHERING, AND HERE'S THE LITTLE ROBOT THAT OUR PARTICIPANT SPOKE ABOUT. SO THE EXPERTS FELT THAT THE PRIMARY USE OF DATA GATHERING FROM THE
utt_0084 utt 405.60 414.75 -X WILD IS TO CAPTURE SENSOR DATA, WHICH CAN CAPTURE HOW USERS ARE USING THE OBJECTS
utt_0085 utt 414.75 421.66 -X WEAR AND TEAR, FUNCTIONAL FAILURES, AND CONTEXTS OF USE. SO HERE Psixteen REFLECTED
utt_0086 utt 421.76 434.72 -X WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO IS IDENTIFY PEOPLE WITHIN THAT POPULATION WHO YOU THINK ARE OTHERWISE SIMILAR SO THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN THE PROFILE ONE CHANGES IS THAT BECAUSE OF A FACTOR THAT IS PARTICULAR TO THEM OR IS IT BECAUSE
utt_0089 utt 434.72 446.98 -X IT IS AFFECTING EVERYBODY? THEN THE PARTICIPANTS REFLECTED ON HOW THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY GENERATE INSIGHT FROM THIS DATA HERE THEY IDENTIFIED THAT A DATA-DRIVEN
utt_0091 utt 446.98 457.11 -X APPROACH WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IN THE EXPLORATION OF SPECIFIC DESIGN RESEARCH QUESTIONS SUCH AS WHEN CONDUCTING AN A/B TEST OR A USABILITY TEST OR AN
utt_0093 utt 457.11 467.27 -X ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY. THEY ALSO HAD IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA, SUCH AS THROUGH THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING, MAYBE WHEN YOU GO INTO WORK YOU WOULD SEE THE
utt_0095 utt 467.27 477.54 -X LAST twenty-four HOURS OF ACTIVITY AND MAYBE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE COLLABORATIVE DASHBOARDS, OR TO EVEN ENGAGE CONSUMERS
utt_0097 utt 477.54 490.63 -X WITHIN FEEDBACK AND ACTUALLY ENGAGE THEM IN QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT THE DATA ACTUALLY MEANS. HERE A KEY QUOTE FROM A PARTICIPANT WAS FROM Pthirty-two WHO SAID. YOU
utt_0099 utt 491.07 503.62 -X HAVE TAKEN A RECOMMENDATION, YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE COMPROMISE, YOU MATCH THAT AGAINST YOUR BRIEF, YOU VIRTUALLY DESIGN IT, YOU TEST IT YOU PROTOTYPE IT, YOU SUBMIT A CHANGE REQUEST, YOU GET FEEDBACK. WITHIN THE THEME OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
utt_0102 utt 503.62 515.00 -X AND REDESIGN THE PARTICIPANTS SPECULATED THAT IN THE FUTURE ALGORITHMS WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE CENTER OF THIS HYPOTHETICAL DATA BELL CURVE WHERE IT
utt_0104 utt 515.00 526.50 -X COULD BE A BELL CURVE CONNECTED TO HOW THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS ARE USING A SPECIFIC DEVICE WHAT TIMES THEY'RE USING IT AT AND SO ON AND IN THE FUTURE
utt_0106 utt 526.50 540.45 -X DESIGNERS MIGHT INSTEAD FOCUS ON THE FRINGES OF THAT DATA SET, ARE THERE NEEDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT BEING MET BY THE CURRENT DESIGN OF A DEVICE IS THERE SOME CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE THAT WOULD CATER TO CERTAIN ETHNOGRAPHIES, OR GROUPS,
utt_0109 utt 540.45 546.47 -X OR NEEDS. IN HERE Ptwo REFLECTED: IS YOUR JOB TO LOOK AT THE DATA THAT
utt_0110 utt 546.85 558.73 -X THE MACHINE LEARNING IS GENERATING OR IS YOUR JOB TO JUST LOOK AT THE OUTLIERS? WITHIN THE THEME OF USER-CENTERED DESIGN THE PARTICIPANT SPECULATED THAT A DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN APPROACH WOULD
utt_0113 utt 558.73 571.24 -X ACTUALLY ENABLE A TRULY USER-CENTERED DESIGN, WHERE PARTICIPANTS/CONSUMERS WOULD BE ENGAGED IN CREATING KNOWLEDGE AND THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY BE ENGAGED IN
utt_0115 utt 571.24 583.59 -X THE PROCESS OF CO-DESIGN AND CO-CREATION. HERE Peleven REFLECTED: WHY DON'T WE GET USERS TO DESIGN THE PRODUCT THAT THEY NEED AND PROVIDE THE MECHANISMS WITH WHICH THEY CAN DO THAT? ANOTHER THEME THAT EMERGED WAS
utt_0118 utt 583.59 595.85 -X SUPPORTING AND SERVICING PRODUCTS AND HERE SOME INTERESTING EXAMPLES CAME FROM PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD WORKED WITHIN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY, WHERE FOR EXAMPLE
utt_0120 utt 596.20 602.09 -X WHAT ROLLS-ROYCE JET ENGINES AREN'T ACTUALLY SOLD THEIR LEASED TO COMPANIES AND
utt_0121 utt 602.63 608.01 -X THEY COLLECT VAST AMOUNTS OF TELEMETRY DATA, WHICH IS USED IN MAINTENANCE. THIS
utt_0122 utt 608.77 612.33 -X TELEMETRY DATA IS CURRENTLY USED POST-HOC,
utt_0123 utt 612.33 622.38 -X HOWEVER PARTICIPANTS REFLECTED THAT A DATA-DRIVEN PROCESS WOULD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO BUILD LASTING PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE EASILY MAINTAINED
utt_0125 utt 622.38 636.92 -X IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THE COST OF SERVICING, HERE Pthree REFLECTED: I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE LIVE DATA STREAMS IN ORDER TO DEBUG. IT IS OVERHEATING, HAS SOMEONE SMACKED IT? THESE THINGS WOULD HELP ME RESOLVE ISSUES QUICKER AND OFFER
utt_0128 utt 636.92 645.74 -X BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AS A RESULT. HOWEVER THE PARTICIPANTS DID IDENTIFY MANY ETHICAL ISSUES WITH THE PROCESS SOME CONNECT TO
utt_0130 utt 647.49 659.40 -X DISEMPOWERING USERS BY REDUCING THEIR PRIVACY, MANIPULATING THEIR BEHAVIOR, AND LIMITING INFORMED CONSENT, BY MAKING DATA COLLECTION INTO A BLACK BOX.
utt_0132 utt 659.40 671.53 -X SIMILARLY THIS PROCESS MIGHT DISEMPOWER DESIGNERS AS WELL BY HANDING OVER CREATIVE PRACTICES TO DATA SCIENTISTS AND ALGORITHMS HERE Ptwo REFLECTED: IF
utt_0134 utt 672.01 684.56 -X YOU FIND OUT THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE NEED BETTER TIRES BECAUSE THEY'RE DRIVING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT DO YOU THEN PRODUCE TIRES THAT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO FASTER? AND IF YOU DON'T DO YOU THEN BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR ADVISING
utt_0137 utt 684.56 698.06 -X THEM TO BUY TIRES THAT DON'T MEET THEIR NEEDS? WITHIN THE THEME OF IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THE PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED THAT THERE'S SIGNIFICANT COSTS AROUND SENSORIZING PRODUCTS DATA STORAGE AND ANALYSIS. FURTHERMORE THERE WERE ISSUES AROUND THE
utt_0140 utt 698.12 703.72 -X NEED FOR MORE FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND AROUND DATA QUALITY AND
utt_0141 utt 704.78 718.25 -X BIAS. Ptwo REFLECTED: IF WE SAY THAT WE'RE A SOFTWARE COMPANY AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THIS DATA IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THAT YOU'RE INVESTING IN THE NEXT UBER, THE NEXT GOOGLE, BUT IF YOU SAY I'M GOING TO MAKE KETTLES AND THEY'VE GOT DATA IN THEM THEY'RE GOING TO ASK HOW MUCH ARE YOUR
utt_0145 utt 718.25 732.01 -X PRODUCTION COSTS AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO SELL THE KETTLES FOR. FINALLY ON THE THEME OF UTOPIAN FUTURE WE SAW THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE BENEFITS INCLUDING BUSINESSES CREATIVES AND CONSUMERS
utt_0148 utt 732.04 746.99 -X CONSUMERS GET WELL DESIGNED PRODUCTS THAT CATER TO THEIR NEEDS, CREATIVES GET A VALUABLE INSIGHT AROUND BEHAVIORS IN THE WILD AND PRODUCERS BENEFIT BY CREATING DESIRABLE PRODUCTS. WITHIN THIS THEME SOME
utt_0151 utt 746.99 757.01 -X PARTICIPANTS SHARED A POSITIVE STORIES SUCH AS AN EXAMPLE FROM NIKE WHO ARE ABLE TO GAUGE WHEN THERE WAS A FLU EPIDEMIC FROM DATA THAT THEY WERE
utt_0153 utt 757.01 771.15 -X GATHERING FROM THEIR DEVICES AND IN RELATION TO THAT Pthree REFLECTED: I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WORLD OF SAND AND GEMSTONES IN A WAY WHERE EVERY LITTLE OPTIMIZATION THAT WE GET FROM THIS WAY OF THINKING IS LIKE A GRAIN OF SAND AND
utt_0156 utt 771.15 784.24 -X OVERALL WE GET A BEACH THAT WE ALL LIKE BUT OCCASIONALLY WE WILL GET A FEW GEMS LIKE THE NIKE EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE THESE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT LEAP US FORWARD IN A BIG WAY. THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN SHORTENED FOR
utt_0159 utt 784.24 797.90 -X THE PURPOSES OF THIS PRESENTATION HOWEVER A KEY POINT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT WE FEEL THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL TO ACTUALLY EXPAND NOTIONS OF DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT DESIGN FROM WHERE THEY CURRENTLY STAND WHICH IS AROUND
utt_0162 utt 797.90 805.60 -X OPTIMIZATION AND MAINTENANCE WE'VE PROPOSED THAT A DESIRABLE DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN TOOL WOULD ENABLE DESIGNERS TO ACTIVELY INVESTIGATE RESEARCH QUESTIONS
utt_0164 utt 805.61 819.15 -X AND THIS CAN BE DONE IN TWO WAYS FIRSTLY BY SENSORIZING PROTOTYPES USED WITHIN DESIGN RESEARCH AND SECONDLY BY UTILIZING DATA FROM CONNECTED PRODUCTS POST MANUFACTURER TO INFORM THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN OF NEW SPECIES OR
utt_0167 utt 819.15 832.15 -X VERSIONS OF THAT PRODUCT. FINALLY A FEW REFLECTIONS ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF CONDUCTING DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT DESIGN IN PRACTICE AN INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA
utt_0169 utt 832.56 843.70 -X CONTEXT. THIS PROCESS WAS PLAUSIBLE TO PARTICIPANTS IN CASES WHERE DATA GATHERING IS ALREADY PART OF THE FUNCTION OF THE DEVICE OR WITHIN A
utt_0171 utt 843.70 855.73 -X SERVICE DESIGN MODEL SPECIFICALLY AND IN ORDER FOR THIS PROCESS TO BE ACCEPTABLE IT NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATED FROM SURVEILLANCE WITH NEGOTIATED PROPER
utt_0173 utt 857.58 872.24 -X INFORMED CONSENT AND WITH A REASONABLE BURDEN FOR PARTICIPANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS. PRACTICES SHOULD NOT JUST BE FOCUSED ON QUANTITATIVE SENSOR DATA BUT THAT SHOULD ALSO BE GROUND
utt_0176 utt 872.24 877.52 -X TRUTH THROUGH QUALITATIVE DATA AND FINALLY NOT EVERY PRODUCT SHOULD BE
utt_0177 utt 877.78 888.18 -X SENSORIZED AND NOT EVERY PRODUCT SHOULD BE COLLECTING DATA, INSTEAD WE SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SENSORIZE A SUBSET OF DEVICES OR A SUBSET OF PROTOTYPES, WHICH
utt_0179 utt 889.42 899.64 -X CAN BE USED IN RESEARCH. IN CONCLUSION THE WORK PRESENTED HERE PRIMARILY CONTRIBUTES A CURRENT INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUTURE OF
utt_0181 utt 899.64 910.71 -X DATA-DRIVEN PRODUCT DESIGN. IT EXPLORES WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF DATA FROM DEVICES IN THE WILD IS USED FOR DESIGN RESEARCH AND SENSE-MAKING THE EXPERTS FELT THAT
utt_0183 utt 910.71 914.87 -X USABILITY TESTS, A/B TESTS, AND ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES CAN ALL BE
utt_0184 utt 915.02 924.18 -X SUPPORTED THROUGH DATA GATHERING FROM PRODUCTS IN THE WILD IN TURN THIS DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH CAN ENABLE THE REDESIGN OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND
utt_0186 utt 924.18 935.54 -X ENABLE A TRULY USER CENTERED DESIGN. HOWEVER ISSUES STILL REMAIN AROUND THE ETHICS, PRIVACY, SECURITY, AND COST OF IMPLEMENTING A DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN
utt_0188 utt 935.54 945.17 -X PROCESS. FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR PARTICIPANTS FOR THEIR TIME THE CHATTY FACTORIES PROJECT, DIGITAL CATAPULT FOR HOSTING OUR EVENT AND
utt_0190 utt 945.17 950.65 -2.5711 ADVERTISING IT IN LONDON AND FOR CENSIS FOR ADVERTISING OUR EVENT IN SCOTLAND.
