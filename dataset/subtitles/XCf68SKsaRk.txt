utt_0000 utt 0.19 7.02 -X IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT APES, A METHOD THAT AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTS ARTICULATED PARTS FROM SPRITE SHEETS.
utt_0002 utt 8.24 12.82 -X IN twoD ANIMATION CHARACTERS ARE USUALLY RIGGED AND MANIPULATED AS PUPPETS,
utt_0008 utt 26.99 34.13 -X ARTISTS START BY DRAWING SEVERAL DIFFERENT POSES AND CONFIGURATIONS OF A CHARACTER IN A SPRITE SHEET AS SHOWN HERE.
utt_0010 utt 34.73 41.43 -X THEY THEN MANUALLY SEGMENT OUT THE COMMON PARTS IN THESE SHEETS AND STITCH THEM TOGETHER TO CREATE A CONTROLLABLE PUPPET.
utt_0012 utt 42.45 43.86 -X GIVEN THIS WORKFLOW,
utt_0013 utt 44.11 54.52 -X OUR GOAL IS TO AUTOMATE PUPPET CREATION BY TAKING AS INPUT SEVERAL DIFFERENT POSES FROM A SPRITE SHEET, AND EXTRACT PARTS THAT BEST EXPRESS THE GIVEN POSES.
utt_0016 utt 55.63 60.76 -X THESE PARTS CAN BE EASILY STITCHED TOGETHER TO FORM A PUPPET THAT IS READY FOR ANIMATION.
utt_0018 utt 62.13 66.68 -X PREVIOUS PART CO-SEGMENTATION METHODS ARE THE MOST RELEVANT WORKS TO OUR TASK.
utt_0020 utt 67.31 71.73 -X YET, THEY USUALLY PRETRAIN NETWORKS WITH NATURAL IMAGES,
utt_0021 utt 71.73 76.12 -X FAIL TO CAPTURE LARGE POSE VARIATION AND ASSUME FIXED ARTICULATION STRUCTURE.
utt_0022 utt 76.50 78.26 -X AS SHOWN IN OUR EXPERIMENTS
utt_0023 utt 78.42 82.45 -X DIRECTLY APPLYING THESE METHODS DOESN'T ACHIEVE SATISFIED RESULTS.
utt_0024 utt 82.90 88.28 -X WE PROPOSE A METHOD TO INFER ARTICULATED PARTS FROM SPRITE SHEETS WITH TWO STAGES.
utt_0025 utt 88.66 91.80 -X THE FIRST STAGE HAS THE FORM OF NEURAL NETWORKS,
utt_0026 utt 92.05 95.77 -X TRAINED TO EXTRACT PARTS FROM A PAIR OF IMAGES.
utt_0027 utt 96.18 106.10 -X THE SECOND STAGE SELECTS A SUBSET OF PARTS FROM PREVIOUS OUTPUT AND SOLVES A PARAMETER-FREE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WHICH DOESN'T REQUIRE TRAINING.
utt_0029 utt 106.10 110.59 -X THE FIRST STAGE CONSISTS OF A CORRESPONDENCE MODULE AND A CLUSTERING MODULE.
utt_0031 utt 110.59 119.61 -X THE INTUITION HERE IS TO DISENTANGLE MOTION FROM APPEARANCE AND USE ONLY MOTION PATTERN TO DISCOVER PARTS, FAVORING BETTER GENERALIZATION.
utt_0033 utt 119.61 121.98 -X CORRESPONDENCE MODULE INFERS PIXEL CORRESPONDENCES
utt_0034 utt 122.07 125.85 -X WHICH CAPTURES THE CANDIDATE MOTIONS OF PIXELS BETWEEN IMAGES.
utt_0035 utt 126.01 129.37 -X THE OUTPUT IS THEN PROCESSED THROUGH THE CLUSTERING MODULE,
utt_0036 utt 129.56 137.08 -X WHICH ATTEMPTS TO FIND PIXELS WITH SIMILAR MOTION PATTERNS AND GROUPS THEM INTO A SET OF CANDIDATE ARTICULATED PARTS AS THE OUTPUT.
utt_0038 utt 137.43 142.20 -X AFTER THE FIRST STAGE, WE GATHER CANDIDATE PARTS FROM ALL PAIRS OF POSES.
utt_0039 utt 142.30 148.92 -X WE THEN APPLY THE SELECTION PROCEDURE TO PICK A COMPACT SUBSET OF PARTS TO REPRESENT THE TARGET PUPPET.
utt_0041 utt 149.34 157.92 -X THE SELECTED PARTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE MINIMAL OVERLAP WITH EACH OTHER AND ALSO SO CAN RECONSTRUCT ALL THE INPUT POSES AS WELL AS POSSIBLE.
utt_0043 utt 158.75 162.64 -X THE NETWORKS OF OUR NETWORK ARE TRAINED IN A SUPERVISED MANNER
utt_0045 utt 162.84 167.42 -X WITH SYNTHETIC DATA USING THE PUPPETS PROVIDED ON OKAYSAMURAI WEBSITE.
utt_0046 utt 168.15 171.33 -X SINCE THE CORRESPONDENCE MODULE IS APPEARANCE SENSITIVE,
utt_0047 utt 171.61 176.11 -X WE FIRST PRETRAIN IT WITH A LARGER DATASET CALLED CREATIVE FLOW PLUS
utt_0048 utt 176.15 180.83 -X WHICH HAS GROUND-TRUTH PIXEL CORRESPONDENCE ANNOTATION.
utt_0049 utt 180.83 184.58 -X HERE WE SHOW THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS ON SYNTHETIC OKAYSAMURAI DATASET.
utt_0050 utt 184.92 189.12 -X THE FIRST ROW ON THE LEFT SHOWS THE INPUT SPRITES IN DIFFERENT POSES.
utt_0051 utt 189.76 194.53 -X THE DASHED RECTANGLE ON THE RIGHT SHOWS THE SELECTED PARTS FROM OUR METHOD.
utt_0053 utt 195.29 200.32 -X THE SECOND ROW ON THE LEFT ARE THE RECONSTRUCTION RESULTS BY DEFORMING THE SELECTED PARTS.
utt_0055 utt 200.54 204.96 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, OUR METHOD EXTRACTS SIX ARTICULATED PARTS.
utt_0056 utt 206.53 209.22 -X HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WITH DIFFERENT STRUCTURE.
utt_0057 utt 209.69 211.97 -X ALTHOUGH THE INPUT IS NOT HUMAN SHAPE,
utt_0058 utt 212.51 215.68 -X OUR METHOD CAN STILL EXTRACT CORRECT NUMBER OF PARTS.
utt_0059 utt 217.05 220.93 -X SOMETIMES THE INPUT SPRITE SHEET CONTAINS MOTION NOT ONLY IN LIMBS,
utt_0060 utt 220.93 224.45 -X BUT ALSO SMALL BODY PARTS SUCH AS THE HAIR IN THIS CASE.
utt_0061 utt 224.45 230.40 -X WHEN THE MOTION IS OBVIOUS, OUR METHOD CAN DISCOVER SMALL PARTS WITH MOTION CONSISTENCY.
utt_0063 utt 231.33 239.49 -X QUANTITATIVELY, WE COMPARE IT WITH SCOPES AND MOCOSEG AS WELL AS THEIR VARIANTS THAT ARE SUPERVISELY TRAINED.
utt_0065 utt 239.49 241.89 -X WE USE PART IOU AS MAIN METRICS.
utt_0066 utt 242.27 250.76 -X FROM THE TABLE, WE CAN SEE OUR OUTPUT PARTS ARE MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE GROUND-TRUTH PARTS THAN ALTERNATIVES BY LARGE MARGIN.
utt_0068 utt 250.76 253.73 -X HERE WE SHOW THE EXTRACTED PARTS FROM REAL SPRITE SHEETS.
utt_0069 utt 253.73 259.08 -X OUR METHOD IS ABLE TO DETECT INTUITIVE ARTICULATED PARTS IN THESE ARTISTS-DRAWN POSES.
utt_0071 utt 260.07 265.19 -X OUR EXTRACTED PARTS CAN BE EASILY STITCHED AND PRODUCE AN ANIMATION SKELETON IF NECESSARY.
utt_0073 utt 265.54 268.65 -X WITH A SIMPLE HEURISTIC DESCRIBED IN OUR PAPER,
utt_0075 utt 272.48 277.03 -X THE RESULTING CONTROL STRUCTURE CAN BE LOADED INTO STANDARD ANIMATION SOFTWARE.
utt_0076 utt 277.09 280.30 -X HERE WE SHOW ONE ANIMATION WITH THE EXTRACTED PARTS.
utt_0077 utt 286.63 291.46 -X AS ANOTHER APPLICATION, THESE ARTICULATED PARTS CAN BE USED IN PUPPET CREATION,
utt_0079 utt 291.46 297.45 -X WHERE PARTS FROM DIFFERENT CHARACTERS CAN BE MIXED AND SWAPPED TO GENERATE PUPPETS WITH NEW PART APPEARANCE.
utt_0081 utt 298.24 299.88 -2.7512 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
