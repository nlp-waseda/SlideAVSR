utt_0000 utt 1.07 5.26 -X I'M ZINIU WU THE FIRST AUTHOR OF VLDB PAPER NUMBER two thousand, one hundred and ninety-four:
utt_0001 utt 6.03 10.67 -X FLAT: FAST LIGHTWEIGHT AND ACCURATE METHOD FOR CARDINALITY ESTIMATION.
utt_0002 utt 14.54 25.97 -X SO THIS TALK WILL MAINLY FOCUS ON THREE PART. FIRST I WILL BRIEFLY OVERVIEW THE EXISTING CARDINALITY ESTIMATION PROBLEM AND THEN I WILL INTRODUCE OUR NEWLY PROPOSED
utt_0004 utt 26.38 38.31 -X PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODEL FACTORIZED SUM PRODUCT NETWORK. LATER, I'LL SHOW HOW TO TURN THIS FSPN INTO A CARDINALITY ESTIMATION METHOD FOR BOTH SINGLE TABLE AND MULTI-TABLE JOIN QUERIES
utt_0006 utt 39.63 52.40 -X OKAY SO CARDINALITY ESTIMATION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF QUERY OPTIMIZER IN DBMS. IT AIMS AT ESTIMATING THE RESULTING NUMBER OF TUPLES OF A QUERY BEFORE ITS ACTUAL EXECUTION.
utt_0008 utt 52.59 58.68 -X IT HAS ATTRACT NUMEROUS ATTENTION SINCE THE RECENT DECADES. NUMEROUS
utt_0009 utt 58.70 65.59 -X ML-BASED METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR CARDINALITY ESTIMATION. THERE MAINLY EXIST THREE CATEGORIES:
utt_0010 utt 65.59 76.34 -X MODEL-FREE METHODS SUCH AS SAMPLING, SUPERVISED METHOD REGRESSES THE FEATURIZED QUERY Q TO ITS CARDINALITY, AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD WHICH WILL BE THE MAIN FOCUS OF OUR RESEARCH.
utt_0012 utt 76.47 82.12 -X SO THE UNSUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD BASICALLY TURNS THE CARDINALITY ESTIMATION PROBLEM
utt_0013 utt 82.19 94.07 -X INTO A STATISTICAL PROBLEM AS WE CAN SEE HERE, THE CARDINALITY OF Q ACTUALLY EQUALS TO THE PROBABILITY OF Q ON TABLE T MULTIPLIED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THIS TABLE.
utt_0015 utt 94.07 105.64 -X THEREFORE, THE CORE TASK OF CARDINALITY ESTIMATION IS TO BUILD MODEL TO CHARACTERIZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF T (THIS DISTRIBUTION) AND SUPPORT INFER THE PROBABILITY OF ANY QUERY ON T. THE
utt_0017 utt 105.64 111.29 -X GOAL OF A GOOD CARDINALITY ESTIMATOR IS TO BE ACCURATE, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND FAST AT THE SAME TIME:
utt_0018 utt 111.60 125.40 -X SO, ACCURATE IN TERMS OF PREDICTION LIGHTWEIGHT IN TERMS OF MODEL STORAGE AND FAST IN TERMS OF THE INFERRING SPEED, TRAINING SPEED, AND UPDATE SPEED. OKAY, SO HOW DO WE BUILD SUCH DISTRIBUTION MODELS?
utt_0020 utt 125.40 137.31 -X SO SUPPOSE WE HAVE A MODEL WITH N SUPPOSE WE HAVE A TABLE WITH AN ATTRIBUTE AND WE WANT TO MODEL ITS JOINT DISTRIBUTION. BRUTE-FORCELY MODELING THIS DISTRIBUTION IS DEFINITELY IMPRACTICAL IT'S GOING
utt_0022 utt 137.31 148.89 -X TO TAKE EXPONENTIAL STORAGE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME FACTORIZATION TOOLS TO SIMPLIFY THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION. THE FIRST ONE IS INDEPENDENT FACTORIZATION, BASICALLY, IT TRYING TO DECOMPOSE
utt_0024 utt 148.89 160.57 -X THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION OF MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES INTO THEIR PRODUCTS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SUCH CARDINALITY ESTIMATION USING SUCH FACTORIZATION IS HISTOGRAM, WHICH ASSUMES ALL ATTRIBUTES ARE
utt_0026 utt 160.57 167.74 -X INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. HISTOGRAM IS VERY INACCURATE BUT IT IS VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND FAST.
utt_0027 utt 168.34 174.65 -X AND RECENTLY, DEEPDB PROPOSED TO USE SUM PRODUCT NETWORK (SPN) AS A NEW CARDINALITY ESTIMATION METHOD.
utt_0028 utt 175.00 180.89 -X IT HAS A LOCAL INDEPENDENT ASSUMPTION BASICALLY IT DIVIDES THE DATASET INTO SMALL PIECES
utt_0029 utt 180.92 185.31 -X AND FOR EACH SMALL PIECE, IT ASSUMES THE ATTRIBUTES ARE INDEPENDENT.
utt_0030 utt 185.69 190.72 -X THIS METHOD IS VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN THERE DOES NOT EXIST HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0031 utt 190.72 201.77 -X HOWEVER, IN PRESENCE OF HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES, WHICH IS VERY COMMON, THE INDEPENDENT FACTORIZATION DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL. IT WILL LEAD TO EITHER LARGE MODEL OR
utt_0033 utt 201.85 213.38 -X VERY INACCURATE ESTIMATION. ANOTHER FACTORIZATION TOOL IS CONDITIONAL FACTORIZATION, WHICH USES THE BAYESIAN RULE AND DECOMPOSES THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION INTO A SMALLER JOINT DISTRIBUTION
utt_0035 utt 213.38 224.93 -X AND A CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION. SEVERAL GOOD EXAMPLES USING THIS FACTORIZATION FOR CARDINALITY ESTIMATION: BAYESIAN NETWORK AND AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS USED BY NARU AND NEUROCARD FOR EXAMPLE.
utt_0037 utt 225.95 231.10 -X IT IS NOT HARD TO SEE THAT BOTH FACTORIZATION HAS THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGES.
utt_0038 utt 231.55 239.27 -X SO IS IT POSSIBLE TO USE BOTH FACTORIZATION TOOLS? AS WE CAN SEE THAT THE EXISTING METHODS USING ONLY
utt_0039 utt 239.71 246.88 -X ONE FACTORIZATION TOOL AND CANNOT BUILD A MODEL THAT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY FAST LIGHTWEIGHT AND ACCURATE.
utt_0040 utt 246.88 259.39 -X THE ANSWER IS DEFINITELY YES. THEREFORE WE PROPOSE OUR FACTORIZED SUM PRODUCT NETWORK (FSPN) AS A NEW PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODEL TO BUILD MODEL DISTRIBUTIONS. THE KEY IDEA OF
utt_0042 utt 260.45 266.53 -X FSPN IS TO USE CONDITIONAL FACTORIZATION TOOL TO FIRST SEPARATE THE STRONGLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES
utt_0043 utt 266.62 271.43 -X FROM THE REST: THE WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES. AND FOR WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES,
utt_0044 utt 271.43 277.80 -X LOCAL INDEPENDENCE LIKELY EXIST SO WE USE LOCAL INDEPENDENT FACTORIZATION TOOLS NAMELY SPN.
utt_0045 utt 280.00 292.04 -X AND FOR HIGHLY CORRELATED ONES THEIR DISTRIBUTION CAN BE EASILY MODELED TOGETHER, SINCE WE CAN USE SOME DIMENSION REDUCTION TECHNIQUES LIKE PCA OR OR PIECEWISE REGRESSION TO REDUCE THE MODEL STORAGE.
utt_0047 utt 293.70 305.51 -X OKAY, WE PRESENT THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF FSPN. HERE, LET'S ASSUME A DATA SET WITH TWO WITH TWO WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES AND TWO HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES. THE CORRELATION AMONG
utt_0049 utt 305.51 311.56 -X THEM ARE ALSO WEAK. AN FSPN MODEL IS A WELL-DEFINED TREE STRUCTURE PROBABILISTIC MODEL
utt_0050 utt 312.35 323.30 -X WITH FOUR TYPE OF INTERNAL NODES AND TWO TYPE OF LEAF NODES HERE. SO, THE FIRST IS THE FACTORIZED NODE SO THE FACTORIZED NODE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES FROM THE REST.
utt_0052 utt 323.40 337.61 -X USING THESE CONDITIONAL FACTORIZATION TOOLS. AND FOR THE WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES, I.E. THIS JOINT DISTRIBUTION, THE LEFT BRANCH OF THE FACTORIZED NODE WILL BE USED TO DEAL WITH IT.
utt_0054 utt 337.61 350.95 -X ESSENTIALLY, IT'S AN SPN SUBSTRUCTURE SO IT CONTAINS A SUM NODE WHICH SPLITS THE DATASET UNTIL LOCAL INDEPENDENCE APPEAR AND A PRODUCT NODE WHICH DETECTS WHETHER THE FOR THE CURRENT
utt_0056 utt 350.95 362.60 -X SUBSET OF DATA, THERE EXISTS SOME ATTRIBUTE INDEPENDENCE. IF THERE EXISTS THEN IT TRIES TO DECOMPOSE IT USING INDEPENDENT FACTORIZATION TOOL. AND WHEN THERE IS ONLY ONE ATTRIBUTE LEFT, THEN WE
utt_0058 utt 362.73 376.38 -X THEN THE FSPN BUILDS A UNIVARIATE THIEF I.E, A ONE-DIMENSIONAL HISTOGRAM OR OTHER PARAMETRIC DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS TO MODEL DIRECTLY MODEL ITS DISTRIBUTION. AND FOR THE RIGHT BRANCH OF A
utt_0060 utt 376.38 388.04 -X FACTORIZED NODE, WE INTRODUCE SPLIT NODE WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM SOME NODE. IT ALSO TRIES TO SPLIT THE DATA SET BUT IT DOESN'T AIM TO FIND INDEPENDENT ATTRIBUTES. IT'S TRYING TO BREAK
utt_0062 utt 388.04 392.35 -X THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES AND THE WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES
utt_0063 utt 392.62 397.93 -X UNTIL ALL THE HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES ARE INDEPENDENT WITH THE WEAKLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES,
utt_0064 utt 397.93 407.69 -X WE INTRODUCE A MULTI-VARIANT LEAF TO DIRECTLY BUILD DISTRIBUTIONS USING MULTI-DIMENSIONAL HISTOGRAM WITH DIMENSIONAL REDUCTION TECHNIQUES ON THE HIGHLY CORRELATED ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0066 utt 409.32 422.03 -X OKAY SO FOR FSPN, ALSO WE PROVIDE VERY EFFECTIVE TRAINING PROCESS AND VERY EFFICIENT ONLINE PROBABILITY INFERENCE PROCESS. DUE TO TIME LIMIT WE WILL NOT GO TOO MUCH DETAIL IN IT SO WE DIRECTLY
utt_0068 utt 422.03 429.04 -X SEE OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULT. WE CAN SEE THAT WE USE TWO REAL WORLD SINGLE TABLE DATASET GAS AND DMV.
utt_0069 utt 429.61 437.07 -X AND ON BOTH DATA SET FSPN ,I.E., FLAT ON SINGLE TABLE ACHIEVES ROUGHLY THE BEST ACCURACY
utt_0070 utt 437.20 447.82 -X WITH VERY SMALL MODEL SIZE AND VERY FAST TRAINING TIME. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE INFERENCE TIME IS ONLY SLOWER THAN HISTOGRAM AND MUCH FASTER THAN THE EXISTING
utt_0072 utt 448.24 454.10 -X ML-BASED METHODS. BEING ABLE TO PREDICT WELL ON SINGLE TABLE IS DEFINITELY
utt_0073 utt 454.35 467.12 -X NOT AS IMPORTANT (ENOUGH) SINCE CARDINALITY ESTIMATOR HAS TO ESTIMATE THE MULTI-TABLE JOIN QUERIES IN ORDER TO SELECT THE OPTIMAL JOIN ORDERS FOR QUERY OPTIMIZING. AND APPARENTLY, WE CANNOT BUILD A MODEL
utt_0075 utt 467.50 480.82 -X FOR EACH POSSIBLE JOIN OF TABLES. IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE EXPONENTIAL SPACE. THEREFORE, INSPIRED BY DEEPDB, WE ADOPT THE DIVIDE AND CONQUER METHOD TO BUILD AN ENSEMBLE OF FSPNS AND TO SUPPORT JOIN QUERIES.
utt_0077 utt 481.49 486.37 -X LET'S TAKE A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE. SUPPOSE A DATABASE WITH THREE TABLES
utt_0079 utt 493.33 506.71 -X WITH C. THEREFORE, WE CAN BUILD A SINGLE FSPN MODEL ON THE FULL OUTER JOIN OF A, B CHARACTERIZING THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS AND ANOTHER ONE FOR TABLE C. AND AGAIN, WE NEED TO ADD A LOT OF FANOUT ATTRIBUTES (PLEASE REFER TO THE PAPER)
utt_0081 utt 506.71 518.93 -X IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THEIR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO FSPNS. SO THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROPOSE THIS THEOREM WHICH IS THEORETICALLY SOUND FOR ANY JOINT QUERIES.
utt_0083 utt 518.93 523.48 -X THEREFORE, USING OUR WAY OF CONSTRUCTING AN ENSEMBLE OF FSPNS THE
utt_0084 utt 525.30 532.52 -X FLAT METHOD CAN ESTIMATE ANY JOIN QUERIES. DUE TO TIME LIMIT I WILL NOT GO INTO DETAILS OF THIS
utt_0085 utt 532.66 540.28 -X EQUATION. PLEASE REFER TO OUR ORIGINAL PAPER THANK YOU. SO FOR THE MULTI-TABLE EXPERIMENT,
utt_0086 utt 540.28 553.66 -X WE USE THE WELL-KNOWN IMDB DATASET AND JOB-LIGHT, JOB-OURS TWO QUERY WORKLOADS. WE CAN SEE THAT FLAT ALSO ACHIEVES THE BEST ACCURACY ON BOTH WORKLOAD WITH RELATIVELY SMALL MODEL SIZE AND
utt_0089 utt 560.12 568.30 -X A VERY EFFICIENT UPDATING METHOD UPDATING RESULTS. OKAY AT LAST, WE INTEGRATE FLAT INTO POSTGRES
utt_0090 utt 568.31 581.15 -X AND WE CAN SEE THAT IT IMPROVES THE POSTGRES BASELINE BY thirteen point four PERCENT WHICH IS SLIGHTLY BETTER OR COMPARABLE TO THE PREVIOUS SOTA OF NEUROCARD. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE TRUE
utt_0092 utt 581.15 587.35 -X CARDINALITY, WHICH REPRESENTS THE BEST THE THAT. POSTGRES METHOD CAN EVER ACHIEVE. THEREFORE, WE CAN
utt_0093 utt 587.48 595.29 -3.5755 SEE THAT FLAT CAN BE A PRACTICAL COUNTERPART OF POSTGRES CARDINALITY ESTIMATOR. THANK YOU.
