utt_0000 utt 0.34 6.16 -X WE PRESENT THE FIRST DATA-EFFICIENT COLLABORATIVE DECENTRALIZED THERMAL-INERTIAL ODOMETRY SYSTEM.
utt_0002 utt 6.28 8.56 -X THIS WORK EXTENDS THE JPL XVIO,
utt_0003 utt 9.00 13.01 -X A STATE-OF-THE-ART SINGLE-AGENT THERMAL INERTIAL ODOMETRY FRAMEWORK
utt_0004 utt 13.20 21.01 -X WE MADE XVIO CAPABLE OF EXCHANGING INFORMATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT AGENTS AND FUSING THEM TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THEIR STATE ESTIMATES.
utt_0009 utt 32.79 36.88 -X A DRONE SWARM CAN EXPLORE VAST AREAS FASTER THAN A SINGLE AGENT,
utt_0010 utt 36.88 42.64 -X SO THAT TASKS LIKE EXPLORATION CAN BE ACHIEVED IN A SHORTER TIME.
utt_0011 utt 42.64 45.30 -X ALSO, IMPACTING ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY SIDE.
utt_0012 utt 45.49 52.69 -X NOT RELYING ON A CENTRAL UNIT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY FAIL INVALIDATING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM MAKES OUR APPROACH ROBUST.
utt_0014 utt 53.07 61.59 -X ALSO, DECENTRALIZED SYSTEMS ARE EASY TO SCALE AND LIGHT IN TERMS OF MEMORY AND PROCESSING POWER.
utt_0016 utt 61.59 72.76 -X RECENTLY ADVANCES IN THERMAL CAMERA DEVELOPMENT HAVE MADE THESE SENSORS MORE AFFORDABLE, WITH HIGHER QUALITY AND MODEST POWER CONSUMPTION DRAWING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION FROM THE COMPUTER VISION RESEARCH COMMUNITY.
utt_0019 utt 73.04 81.17 -X THERMAL CAMERAS ALLOW AUTONOMOUS AGENTS TO OPERATE IN ALL TYPES OF LIGHT CONDITIONS, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN EXTERNAL LIGHTING SOURCE.
utt_0021 utt 81.33 87.70 -X WE MANAGED TO TRACK MORE THAN THREE AND A HALF TIMES FAST CORNERS THAN THE VISUAL DATA IN LOW-LIGHT SCENES.
utt_0023 utt 88.43 96.44 -X LITERATURE ON COLLABORATIVE VIO SYSTEMS IS VAST AND CAN BE DIVIDED BETWEEN CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED METHODS.
utt_0025 utt 97.01 98.39 -X THE FORMER, LIKE
utt_0026 utt 98.48 108.95 -X IN THE WORKS OF FORSTER AND SCHMUCK, IS BASED ON A CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT DESIGNATED TO FUSE THE DATA COMING FROM VARIOUS AGENTS.
utt_0028 utt 109.20 119.73 -X THESE TYPES OF APPROACHES USUALLY RUN ON THE CENTRAL UNIT COMPUTATIONALLY DEMANDING ALGORITHMS, FOR EXAMPLE, BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT, POINT CLOUD ALIGNMENT, ETC.
utt_0030 utt 120.21 127.86 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, DECENTRALIZED APPROACHES FUSE THE DATA DIRECTLY ON BOARD THE AGENT, AS ZHU IS DOING IN HIS WORK,
utt_0032 utt 127.86 133.27 -X CONSTRAINING AN EKF WITH DATA COMING FROM THE OTHER DRONES.
utt_0033 utt 133.49 140.18 -X HENCE, LOW PROCESSING POWER ALGORITHMS ARE REQUIRED TO RUN ONLINE AND IN REAL-TIME.
utt_0034 utt 140.18 145.62 -X ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS IS DATA EXCHANGE.
utt_0035 utt 145.78 147.09 -X CIESLEWSKI ET AL.
utt_0036 utt 147.09 153.72 -X SHOW HOW WE CAN GAIN LOW BANDWIDTH REQUIREMENTS IN A COLLABORATIVE SYSTEM USING FULL IMAGE DESCRIPTORS.
utt_0038 utt 154.45 158.90 -X HOWEVER, ALL THESE WORKS ARE DESIGNED FOR STANDARD VISUAL DATA.
utt_0039 utt 159.32 161.14 -X ON THE THERMAL IMAGERY SIDE,
utt_0040 utt 161.14 170.94 -X THERE ARE WORKS LIKE THE ONE FROM KHATTAK AND DELAUNE THAT SHOW HOW THERMAL INFRARED DATA CAN BE USED TO ACHIEVE GOOD RESULTS IN STATE ESTIMATION.
utt_0042 utt 170.96 178.84 -X OUR WORK WANTS TO FILL THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE PROPOSING THE FIRST COLLABORATIVE THERMAL INERTIAL ODOMETRY SYSTEM.
utt_0044 utt 178.84 186.90 -X THE SINGLE AGENT XVIO ARCHITECTURE EXTRACTS FAST CORNERS AND TRACKS THEM IN THE INCOMING IMAGES STREAM USING THE LUKAS KANADE TRACKER.
utt_0046 utt 186.93 191.80 -X TRACKS ARE THEN PROCESSED AS MSCKF OR SLAM BY THE EKF.
utt_0047 utt 193.08 198.04 -X HERE WITH SLAM, WE MEAN THE LANDMARKS KEPT IN THE FILTER'S STATE.
utt_0048 utt 198.13 203.83 -X THE INCOMING IMU DATA IS INTEGRATED AS A PRIOR UPDATE FOR THE FILTER.
utt_0049 utt 203.83 212.92 -X THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COLLABORATIVE SETUP ALLOWS THE PREVIOUS FRAMEWORK TO RECEIVE AND SEND DATA TO THE OTHER AGENTS AND FUSE INCOMING INFORMATION.
utt_0051 utt 212.92 218.68 -X WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE NEW BLOCKS STARTING FROM THE FRONT END AND TRACKS MATCHING.
utt_0053 utt 218.77 226.49 -X WE USE AN ONLINE PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATION ALGORITHM TO ATTENUATE THE DISTURBANCES AND ARTIFACTS THAT THERMAL IMAGES ARE AFFECTED BY.
utt_0055 utt 226.52 235.39 -X WITH THIS APPROACH, WE ARE CAPABLE TO GET FOUR TIMES MORE TRACKS THAN THE RAW THERMAL IMAGERY, AND THE FEATURE MATCHING IS ALMOST DOUBLED.
utt_0057 utt 235.39 239.80 -X AS A RESULT, MORE COLLABORATIVE UPDATES BETWEEN THE UAVS CAN BE PERFORMED.
utt_0058 utt 240.09 244.80 -X KEYPOINTS DETECTED AND TRACKED IN THE FRONT END ARE COUPLED WITH ORB
utt_0059 utt 247.10 251.23 -X DESCRIPTORS, AND A BINARY VLAD IS GENERATED FOR EACH INCOMING IMAGE.
utt_0060 utt 251.64 257.63 -X TO SPEED UP THIS PROCESS BEING ORB BINARY DESCRIPTOR, WE USE ONLY BINARY OPERATIONS.
utt_0061 utt 257.63 261.63 -X THEREFORE, THE COMPUTATIONAL COST IS NEGLIGIBLE.
utt_0062 utt 261.63 266.59 -X THE GENERATED DESCRIPTOR IS SENT TO THE OTHER ROBOTS USING THE ROS STREAMING SYSTEM.
utt_0066 utt 278.20 285.28 -X ONCE AN AGENT RECEIVES THE VLAD CHECKS IN THE HISTORY OF ITS KEYFRAMES, IF THERE IS A SIMILAR DESCRIPTOR.
utt_0068 utt 286.11 290.29 -X IF SO, IT RETRIEVES THE STATE, THE COVARIANCE AND THE TRACKS
utt_0069 utt 290.49 295.68 -X AT THAT KEYFRAME AND SEND THEM BACK TO THE DRONE THAT HAS SENT THE REQUEST.
utt_0070 utt 296.73 308.29 -X THE UAV THAT RECEIVES THE RESPONSE MESSAGE WITH THE TRACKS TRIED TO FIND A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN ITS CURRENT TRACKS AND THEIR RECEIVED ONES TO PERFORM THE COLLABORATIVE UPDATES.
utt_0073 utt 308.29 318.93 -X THE RESULTS OF OUR APPROACH AGAINST THE STATE-OF-THE-ART CENTRALIZED COLLABORATIVE SYSTEM COVINS SHOW THAT OUR WORK CAN USE A QUARTER OF THE MESSAGES EXCHANGED WITHIN THE SYSTEM
utt_0076 utt 318.94 322.65 -X AND REQUIRES MUCH LESS CPU AND MEMORY CONCERNING THE OTHER,
utt_0077 utt 322.65 327.55 -X UNDERLINING THE LOWER PROCESSING POWER NEEDED FOR THE DECENTRALIZED METHODS.
utt_0078 utt 327.71 337.50 -X NOTWITHSTANDING, A DRAWBACK OF FILTER-BASED APPROACHES IS THAT THE STATE ESTIMATE IS LESS ACCURATE THAN THE OPTIMIZATION-BASED ONES,
utt_0080 utt 337.50 340.51 -X AS SHOWN BY THE REPORTED ABSOLUTE TRAJECTORY ERRORS.
utt_0081 utt 341.34 348.29 -X THE BACKEND OF OUR WORK USES THE FUSION DATA PIPELINE FOR MSCKF AND SLAM PROPOSED BY ZHU ET AL.
utt_0083 utt 348.80 352.69 -X IT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE COVARIANCE INTERSECTION ALGORITHM
utt_0084 utt 353.95 360.67 -X TO MAINTAIN THE EKF CONSISTENT WITHOUT KEEPING TRACK OF THE CROSS CORRELATION BETWEEN THE STATE OF THE AGENTS.
