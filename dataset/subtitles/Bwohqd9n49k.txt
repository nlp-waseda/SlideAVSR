utt_0000 utt 0.05 5.04 -X THIS IS PART OF OUR VIDEO SERIES ON HUMAN-CENTERED EVALUATIONS FOR NLP EXPLANATIONS.
utt_0001 utt 5.55 7.57 -X CHECK OUT THE LINK FOR MORE RESOURCES.
utt_0002 utt 8.11 9.49 -X YOU'RE CURRENTLY HERE ...
utt_0003 utt 9.68 11.66 -X THANKS VERA FOR THE OVERVIEW!
utt_0004 utt 11.79 19.70 -X I WILL NOW GIVE A QUICK INTRO TO EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BEFORE TURNING IT BACK OVER TO VERA TO ILLUSTRATE THESE CONCEPTS WITH SPECIFIC EXPLANATION USE CASES.
utt_0006 utt 20.97 32.34 -X IN THIS CRASH COURSE ON EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, I WILL DETAIL HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR RESEARCH METHOD AND DESIGN YOUR EXPERIMENTAL TASK, INCLUDING HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE YOUR MEASURES AND DESIGN YOUR TASK PROCEDURE.
utt_0009 utt 33.52 39.89 -X THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTAL METHODS TO CHOOSE FROM, INCLUDING INTERVIEWS, LAB EXPERIMENTS, AND SURVEYS.
utt_0011 utt 39.98 43.86 -X AND, THE “RIGHT” METHOD DEPENDS ON YOUR WHERE YOU ARE IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND
utt_0012 utt 44.08 47.38 -X THE QUESTIONS YOU’RE TRYING TO ANSWER.
utt_0013 utt 47.50 51.63 -X SO, IN SYSTEM DESIGN, RESEARCH CAN BE EITHER FORMATIVE OR SUMMATIVE.
utt_0014 utt 51.85 58.32 -X FORMATIVE, OR EXPLORATORY RESEARCH IS USED TO UNDERSTAND USER NEEDS, EVALUATE, AND REFINE IDEAS.
utt_0016 utt 58.77 71.83 -X FORMATIVE RESEARCH IS APPROPRIATE FOR EARLY STAGE RESEARCH LOOKING TO UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE, FOR WHICH MODEL OUTPUTS DO USERS NEED EXPLANATION OR GENERALLY, WHAT EXPLANATION QUALITIES DO USERS DESIRE?
utt_0019 utt 72.18 76.53 -X HERE YOU MIGHT USE INTERVIEWS OR SURVEYS TO GATHER OPEN ENDED INSIGHTS.
utt_0020 utt 77.87 83.25 -X SUMMATIVE, EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IS USED TO TO VALIDATE SYSTEMS AND TEST HYPOTHESES.
utt_0021 utt 83.25 94.07 -X IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR LATER STAGE RESEARCH TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS, DOES EXPLANATION IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OR WHICH EXPLANATION STYLE IMPROVES UNDERSTANDING.
utt_0023 utt 94.16 103.83 -X HERE YOU MIGHT USE A CONTROLLED LAB EXPERIMENT WHERE YOU COMPARE EXPLANATION ALTERNATIVES OR A FIELD STUDY WHERE YOU OBSERVE PEOPLE USING YOUR SYSTEM IN AN ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0025 utt 104.72 108.92 -X WE ALSO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS.
utt_0026 utt 109.17 112.34 -X QUANTITATIVE METHODS HELP US TO UNDERSTAND “THE WHAT”.
utt_0027 utt 112.43 119.22 -X SUCH AS, HOW QUICKLY USERS PERFORM A TASK OR HOW FREQUENTLY USERS INTERACT WITH AN EXPLANATION.
utt_0028 utt 119.35 123.13 -X ALTERNATIVELY, QUALITATIVE METHODS ANSWER THE “WHY”.
utt_0029 utt 123.31 130.84 -X LIKE, WHY WAS A PARTICULAR EXPLANATION TYPE PREFERRED OR WHY A MODEL OUTPUT WAS FRUSTRATING.
utt_0030 utt 130.84 139.83 -X OUR FOCUS FOR THIS TUTORIAL IS ON CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS FOR SUMMATIVE RESEARCH, WHERE WE WANT TO TEST AND EVALUATE SYSTEM EXPLANATIONS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESES.
utt_0032 utt 140.63 147.77 -X WE SUGGEST QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES SUPPLEMENTING WITH QUALITATIVE METHODS, OR WITH MIXED METHODS APPROACHES.
utt_0034 utt 147.77 151.61 -X SO, AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL..
utt_0035 utt 151.61 160.12 -X IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT, WE START WITH A TESTABLE HYPOTHESIS, PERHAPS THAT AN EXPLANATION WILL IMPROVE PERFORMANCE FOR A TASK COMPARED TO NO EXPLANATION.
utt_0037 utt 160.12 164.02 -X (X) TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SPLIT OUR USERS INTO GROUPS.
utt_0038 utt 164.02 171.45 -X (X) FROM THERE, WE MANIPULATE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES (SUCH AS, WHETHER OR NOT A USER RECEIVES AN EXPLANATION).
utt_0040 utt 171.45 175.35 -X (X) AND THEN WE OBSERVE DEPENDENT VARIABLES (SUCH AS PERFORMANCE).
utt_0041 utt 175.35 180.03 -X (X) FINALLY, WE RUN STATISTICAL TESTS TO COMPARE THE TWO GROUPS.
utt_0042 utt 180.03 184.60 -X ASKING, DID THE GROUP WHO RECEIVED EXPLANATION PERFORM SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER?
utt_0043 utt 184.69 187.35 -X AND THEN WE ACCEPT OR REJECT OUR HYPOTHESIS.
utt_0044 utt 188.57 192.03 -X SO, LET’S WALKTHROUGH HOW YOU’D DESIGN A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT.
utt_0045 utt 192.50 198.71 -X PARTICULARLY, WE SUGGEST APPLICATION-GROUNDED EXPERIMENTS, CENTERED ON AN EXPLANATION “USE CASE”.
utt_0047 utt 199.06 208.92 -X WE’LL TALK THROUGH HIGH-LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS FOR EXPERIMENT DESIGN NOW AND VERA WILL DISCUSS SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION-GROUNDED EXPERIMENTS IN THE NEXT PART OF THE TUTORIAL
utt_0049 utt 209.56 215.80 -X (X) SO FIRST, YOU’LL REVISIT YOUR GOALS: FOR YOUR EXPLANATION USE CASE, WHAT ARE USERS’ OBJECTIVES?
utt_0051 utt 215.80 218.84 -X WHY DO USERS NEED EXPLANATIONS FOR THOSE OBJECTIVES?
utt_0052 utt 218.97 222.24 -X IS IT SO THEY CAN PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE THE MODEL?
utt_0053 utt 222.26 225.88 -X OR TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AIDED BY THE AI FOR A TASK?
utt_0054 utt 226.10 228.67 -X OR PERHAPS IT’S TO ASSESS FAIRNESS OR BIAS?
utt_0055 utt 229.08 234.01 -X SO, FROM OUR EXAMPLE BEFORE, OUR GOAL IS TO IMPROVE USERS’ DECISION MAKING PERFORMANCE.
utt_0056 utt 234.01 238.52 -X (X) NEXT, YOU’LL ARTICULATE YOUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES.
utt_0057 utt 238.71 242.20 -X SO, THINK ABOUT HOW EXPLANATIONS WILL AFFECT YOUR GOALS?
utt_0058 utt 242.20 246.52 -X AND *WHY* EXPLANATION CAN (OR CAN’T) ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS.
utt_0059 utt 246.62 255.04 -X SO, FROM OUR EXAMPLE, OUR RESEARCH QUESTION IS HOW EXPLANATIONS AFFECT DECISION MAKING PERFORMANCE, HYPOTHESIZING A POSITIVE EFFECT.
utt_0061 utt 256.03 262.24 -X SO, GIVEN THESE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES, WE CAN DESIGN MORE DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL TASK.
utt_0063 utt 262.75 266.75 -X IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE STEPS CAN INFORM THE OTHERS.
utt_0064 utt 266.75 271.07 -X FOR EXAMPLE YOUR CHOICE OF MEASURES CAN INFORM YOUR TREATMENTS OR YOUR PROCEDURE.
utt_0065 utt 271.29 276.06 -X EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN IS VERY MUCH AN ITERATIVE PROCESS (NOT STEP BY STEP).
utt_0066 utt 277.34 281.02 -X BUT, WITH THAT SAID, LET’S WALK THROUGH EACH OF THESE STEP-BY-STEP..
utt_0067 utt 281.15 286.37 -X SO, FIRST CONSIDER THE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS, OR WHAT ARE YOUR EXPERIMENTAL FACTORS OR CONDITIONS
utt_0069 utt 287.14 297.44 -X (X) YOU MIGHT DO A SIMPLE COMPARISON OF YES VS. NO EXPLANATION, (X) OR YOU MIGHT DO A TWO FACTORIAL DESIGN WHERE YOU COMPARE EXPLANATION AND MODEL PERFORMANCE.
utt_0071 utt 297.44 303.58 -X (X) AND YOUR DESIGN TELLS YOU HOW MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS YOU’LL NEED TO COMPARE.
utt_0072 utt 304.25 307.20 -X NEXT, CHOOSE YOUR EVALUATION CONSTRUCTS.
utt_0073 utt 307.32 316.06 -X FOR APPLICATION-GROUNDED EVALUATION, IT’S IMPORTANT TO ALWAYS MEASURE USE CASE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES WE’LL SHARE MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES LATER IN THE TUTORIAL.
utt_0075 utt 316.35 324.35 -X ADDITIONALLY, IT IS OFTEN HELPFUL TO MEASURE MODEL UNDERSTANDING, THIS CAN HELP YOU TO KNOW WHETHER EXPLANATIONS HAD AN EFFECT ON USERS’ MENTAL MODELS.
utt_0077 utt 324.61 329.79 -X YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER USER EFFECTS OF EXPLANATIONS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE.
utt_0078 utt 330.05 332.55 -X THESE CAN BE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE.
utt_0079 utt 332.67 343.23 -X SUCH AS, ON USERS’ COGNITIVE LOAD, HOW LONG IT TAKES THEM TO PROCESS THE EXPLANATION AND PERFORM THE TASK, AND ON THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE AI MODEL.
utt_0081 utt 343.23 347.97 -X GIVEN YOUR EVALUATION CONSTRUCTIONS, YOU NEED TO OPERATIONALIZE THEM WITH SPECIFIC MEASUREMENTS.
utt_0082 utt 349.09 353.09 -X SO, A CONSTRUCT CAN HAVE MANY WAYS TO OPERATIONALIZE ITS MEASUREMENT.
utt_0083 utt 353.28 357.63 -X AT THE BASIC LEVEL WE CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE.
utt_0084 utt 357.73 360.07 -X SO, TAKING “UNDERSTANDING” AS AN EXAMPLE.
utt_0085 utt 360.07 373.32 -X (X) WE CAN MEASURE OBJECTIVELY BY TESTING USERS’ MENTAL MODEL, SUCH AS ASKING USERS TO SIMULATE WHAT A MODEL WILL OUTPUT GIVEN A PARTICULAR INPUT OR WHICH FEATURES WERE MOST IMPORTANT FOR A DECISION.
utt_0088 utt 373.32 385.12 -X (X) WE CAN ALSO MEASURE SUBJECTIVELY TO GET AT THE USERS’ PERCEIVED UNDERSTANDING BY ASKING THEM TO SELF REPORT WITH RATING SCALES, SUCH AS THEIR AGREEMENT WITH THE PHRASE “I UNDERSTAND HOW THE AI WORKS”.
utt_0092 utt 427.36 431.94 -X GOING BACK TO OUR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, WE NEXT NEED TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PARTICIPANTS.
utt_0093 utt 431.94 435.27 -X (X) THEY SHOULD REFLECT THE AUDIENCE FOR THE TARGET USE CASE.
utt_0094 utt 435.27 438.34 -X SO, YOU’LL WANT TO CONSIDER THEIR DOMAIN AND DATASET EXPERTISE.
utt_0095 utt 438.50 441.26 -X AND THEIR MACHINE LEARNING OR AI EXPERTISE.
utt_0096 utt 441.48 446.98 -X IN BOTH CASES YOU MIGHT WANT ONLY NON-EXPERTS, EXPERTS OR A MIX OF EXPERTISE.
utt_0097 utt 446.98 452.62 -X YOU SHOULD ALSO ENSURE AN EVEN DISTRIBUTION FROM DIFFERENT AGES, GENDERS, AND OTHER GROUPS.
utt_0098 utt 452.62 456.81 -X (X) HOW MANY PARTICIPANTS YOU’LL NEED DEPENDS ON THE TASK DESIGN.
utt_0099 utt 456.81 461.99 -X YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH PARTICIPANTS TO GIVE STATISTICAL POWER TO TEST YOUR HYPOTHESIS.
utt_0100 utt 462.50 466.60 -X IN GENERAL, CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS NEED LOTS OF PARTICIPANTS!!
utt_0101 utt 466.95 471.98 -X FINALLY, YOU CAN DEVELOP YOUR PROCEDURE OR HOW PARTICIPANTS WILL PERFORM THE TASK.
utt_0102 utt 472.87 482.22 -X FIRST, DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR EXPERIMENT WILL BE DESIGNED AS WITHIN SUBJECTS OR BETWEEN SUBJECTS, MEANING WILL PARTICIPANTS SEE ONLY ONE TREATMENT OR MULTIPLE?
utt_0104 utt 482.73 489.93 -X WITHIN SUBJECTS IS USEFUL FOR ASKING ABOUT USERS’ PREFERENCES, SUCH AS WHETHER THEY PREFERRED HAVING OR NOT HAVING AN EXPLANATION.
utt_0106 utt 490.09 494.54 -X HOWEVER, BETWEEN SUBJECTS IS BETTER FOR OVERCOMING ORDERING OR TRAINING EFFECTS.
utt_0107 utt 494.66 503.91 -X SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE WITHIN-SUBJECTS DESIGN, YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVE EXPLANATIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF A STUDY WILL GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM,
utt_0109 utt 503.91 509.48 -X WHICH WOULD THEN AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE STUDY (EVEN WITHOUT EXPLANATIONS).
utt_0111 utt 509.57 514.48 -X BETWEEN SUBJECTS OVERCOMES THESE POTENTIAL CONFOUNDS, BUT REQUIRES MORE PARTICIPANTS.
utt_0112 utt 515.40 520.08 -X YOU SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER PHASES YOUR PARTICIPANTS MIGHT NEED.
utt_0113 utt 520.08 525.84 -X (X) FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WILL LIKELY NEED TO INCLUDE A TUTORIAL TO EXPLAIN HOW THE TASK OR SYSTEM WORKS.
utt_0115 utt 526.02 530.73 -X THIS CAN INCLUDE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF WHAT PARTICIPANTS CAN EXPECT TO SEE DURING THE TASK.
utt_0117 utt 530.73 538.00 -X (X) YOU’LL ALSO DETERMINE HOW MANY INSTANCES (OR TASKS) PARTICIPANTS WILL DO OR HOW LONG THEY’LL SPEND WITH THE TASK SYSTEM.
utt_0119 utt 538.41 542.51 -X IF YOU’LL HAVE PARTICIPANTS INTERACT WITH THE TASK SYSTEM OVER MULTIPLE INSTANCES, YOU
utt_0120 utt 542.60 545.16 -X NEED TO CONSIDER THEIR ORDER.
utt_0121 utt 545.16 554.93 -X (X) TYPICALLY YOU WILL WANT TO RANDOMIZE INSTANCES, AS USING THE SAME ORDER ALL THE THE TIME CAN LEAD TO LEARNING EFFECTS (WHERE PARTICIPANTS DO BETTER ON LATER INSTANCES THAN EARLIER ONES).
utt_0124 utt 555.11 558.29 -X AND, ALL OF THIS COMES TOGETHER TO MAKE UP YOUR STUDY PLAN.
utt_0125 utt 558.70 566.35 -X SO, NOW VERA WILL GO THROUGH SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF EVALUATIONS BEFORE WE COME BACK TO SOME EVALUATION CHALLENGES AND TIPS FOR SUCCESS.
utt_0127 utt 567.27 568.97 -X THIS IS VIDEO ISN'T THE END.
