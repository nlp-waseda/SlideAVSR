utt_0000 utt 0.65 7.15 -X WE PRESENT LAMAR, A NEW BENCHMARK FOR LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING IN THE CONTEXT OF AUGMENTED REALITY.
utt_0001 utt 8.46 17.62 -X TO PLACE DIGITAL CONTENT IN THE REAL WORLD, AUGMENTED REALITY DEVICES NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN threeD WHILE USERS EVOLVE THROUGH LARGE SPACES.
utt_0003 utt 17.74 22.74 -X POSE TRACKING ALGORITHMS COMPUTE THE POSITION AND ORIENTATION IN A LOCAL REFERENCE FRAME,
utt_0004 utt 22.74 30.35 -X BUT PERSISTENT AND COLLABORATIVE EXPERIENCES REQUIRE GLOBAL POSITIONING WITH HIGH ACCURACY AND DESPITE TEMPORAL CHANGES.
utt_0006 utt 30.35 33.59 -X THIS IS ACHIEVED BY BUILDING SHARED VISUAL threeD MAPS,
utt_0007 utt 33.59 37.36 -X IN WHICH NEW DEVICES CAN LATER LOCALIZE WITH IMAGE MATCHING.
utt_0008 utt 38.03 48.63 -X TO MEASURE THE PROGRESS ON THIS PROBLEM, WE INTRODUCE THE FIRST BENCHMARK THAT FAITHFULLY CAPTURES THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF AR FOR VISUAL LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING.
utt_0010 utt 50.29 56.63 -X WE CONSIDER three LARGE SCENES THAT INCLUDE SMALL AND LARGE INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SPACES:
utt_0011 utt 56.63 60.92 -X AN OFFICE BUILDING, A UNIVERSITY BUILDING, AND AN OLD CITY CENTER.
utt_0020 utt 107.99 111.99 -X EXISTING DATASETS DO NOT CAPTURE REALISTIC AR CONDITIONS.
utt_0021 utt 112.31 118.49 -X MANY DATASETS FOCUS ON DRIVING SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT MOTIONS PATTERNS AND SENSORS THAN AR.
utt_0022 utt 118.96 127.58 -X DATASETS CROWD-SOURCED FROM CONSUMER DEVICES EITHER INCLUDE ONLY SINGLE ISOLATED IMAGES OR ARE LIMITED TO SMALL SCENES LIKE SINGLE ROOMS.
utt_0024 utt 127.89 131.45 -X THEY GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE GROUND TRUTH
utt_0025 utt 131.54 134.68 -X AS IT IS COMPUTED BY STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION OR SLAM.
utt_0026 utt 135.09 144.63 -X DATASETS WITH ACCURATE GROUND TRUTH ARE CAPTURED AT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME AND THUS LACK LONG-TERM TEMPORAL CHANGES.
utt_0028 utt 144.63 152.15 -X LAMAR IS THE FIRST BENCHMARK THAT CORRECTLY TRACKS THE PROGRESS OF RESEARCH ON VISUAL LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING IN TYPICAL AR SCENARIOS.
utt_0030 utt 152.41 157.66 -X THE DATASET INCLUDES ACCURATE GROUND TRUTH MODELS COMPUTED USING A NEW AUTOMATED PIPELINE.
utt_0031 utt 157.94 163.90 -X OUR BENCHMARK REVEALS KEY RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES MISSED BY EXISTING DATASETS.
utt_0032 utt 163.90 167.00 -X THE APPEARANCE OF EACH SCENE VARIES WIDELY ACROSS DEVICES,
utt_0033 utt 167.00 170.27 -X MAKING CROSS-DEVICE MAPPING AND LOCALIZATION CHALLENGING.
utt_0034 utt 170.52 181.50 -X THE DATASET CAPTURES SHORT TERM APPEARANCES CHANGES, LIKE DAY-NIGHT CYCLES, BUT ALSO LONG-TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES FOR EXAMPLE DUE TO CONSTRUCTIONS WORKS OR TO THE DISPLACEMENT OF INDOOR FURNITURE.
utt_0036 utt 183.00 190.46 -X ALL TRAJECTORIES ARE GLOBALLY REGISTERED WITH CENTIMETER ACCURACY BY FUSING THE AR SENSOR STREAMS WITH THE GROUND TRUTH LASER SCANS.
utt_0038 utt 190.87 193.37 -X DESPITE CHALLENGING VIEWING CONDITIONS,
utt_0039 utt 193.40 198.75 -X THE PROCESS IS ENTIRELY AUTOMATED AND REQUIRES NO MANUAL ANNOTATION OF ANY SORT.
utt_0040 utt 198.94 204.99 -X WE THEREFORE KNOW THE POSE OF EACH SENSOR MEASUREMENT BUT ALSO THE DETAILED threeD GEOMETRY OF EACH SCENE.
utt_0042 utt 207.45 215.61 -X THE ACCURACY CAN BE VERIFIED BY COMPARING THE CAPTURED IMAGES WITH RENDERINGS OF THE threeD MODELS USING COLOR OR DEPTH.
utt_0044 utt 219.51 227.23 -X WITH LAMAR, WE EVALUATE STATE OF THE ART APPROACHES TO LOCALIZE IMAGES FROM DIFFERENT DEVICES IN A GIVEN CROWD-SOURCED MAP.
utt_0046 utt 227.32 231.42 -X WE MEASURE THE RECALL OF THE ESTIMATED QUERY POSES AT tenCM AND oneDEG,
utt_0047 utt 232.22 235.42 -X AN ACCURACY REQUIRED BY MOST AR APPLICATIONS.
utt_0048 utt 235.77 240.86 -X EXISTING ACADEMIC BENCHMARKS FOCUS ON LOCALIZATION WITH SINGLE ISOLATED IMAGES.
utt_0049 utt 241.02 244.89 -X CONSIDERING THE ADDITIONAL SENSORS AVAILABLE ON AR DEVICES,
utt_0050 utt 244.89 248.83 -X WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THIS LOW PERFORMANCE.
utt_0051 utt 248.83 254.18 -X FIRST, MULTI-CAMERA RIGS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ACCURATE THAN SINGLE IMAGES.
utt_0052 utt 254.18 259.52 -X SECOND, WE CAN LEVERAGE RADIO SIGNALS TO CONSTRAIN THE PLACE RECOGNITION.
utt_0053 utt 259.52 266.72 -X THIRD, WE CAN LEVERAGE TEMPORAL STREAMS BY COMBINING MULTIPLE IMAGES WITH LOCAL ODOMETRY POSES.
utt_0055 utt 266.72 271.10 -X HERE, SEQUENCES OF JUST ten SECONDS YIELD A LARGE BOOST.
utt_0056 utt 271.93 275.74 -X LAST, BOTH RADIOS AND SEQUENCES CAN BE COMBINED.
utt_0057 utt 276.25 284.35 -X THIS SHOWS THAT THE SINGLE-IMAGE SETTING IS ARTIFICIALLY DIFFICULT AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF PRACTICAL AR SYSTEMS.
utt_0059 utt 284.70 287.84 -X YET, THE PROBLEM OF LOCALIZATION IS NOT SOLVED,
utt_0060 utt 287.84 294.08 -X AS ALMOST ALL QUERIES SHARE SOME VISUAL OVERLAP WITH THE MAP AND ARE THEREFORE LOCALIZABLE.
utt_0061 utt 294.08 301.67 -X THIS UPPER BOUND SHOWS THAT FURTHER RESEARCH ON IMAGE MATCHING AND OPTIMAL SENSOR FUSION IS NEEDED TO MAKE LOCALIZATION READY FOR AR.
utt_0063 utt 303.61 311.97 -X FOR A COMPELLING USER EXPERIENCE, APPLICATIONS SHOULD STRIVE TO RETRIEVE AND VISUALIZE CONTENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER STARTING A SESSION.
utt_0065 utt 312.16 320.32 -X TO QUANTIFY THIS, WE INTRODUCE A NEW METRIC, THE TIME-TO-RECALL, WHICH MEASURES THE SEQUENCE DURATION NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL LOCALIZATION.
utt_0066 utt 320.51 326.56 -X HERE, LOCALIZING A HOLOLENS IN AT LEAST eighty% OF THE QUERIES REQUIRES MORE THAN tenS SECONDS.
utt_0067 utt 326.88 330.53 -X USING RADIO SIGNALS REDUCES THIS TO LESS THAN two SECONDS.
utt_0068 utt 330.91 334.85 -X NO CURRENT APPROACH HOWEVER REACHES A RECALL OF ninety% IN LESS THAN tenS.
utt_0069 utt 338.18 345.57 -X LAMAR IS THE FIRST BENCHMARK THAT FAITHFULLY CAPTURES THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF AR FOR VISUAL LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING.
utt_0071 utt 345.57 350.95 -X THE DATASET, GROUND TRUTHING PIPELINE, AND THE BENCHMARK ARE ALL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.
utt_0072 utt 350.95 352.23 -2.5539 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
