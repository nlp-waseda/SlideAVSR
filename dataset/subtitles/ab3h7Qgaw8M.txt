utt_0000 utt 1.96 14.29 -X WELCOME AND GREETINGS FROM BOULDER, COLORADO IN THE STATES. I'M STEPHEN VORAN AT THE INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SCIENCES. I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THIS WORK AND I
utt_0002 utt 14.29 19.44 -X WANT TO THANK THE QOMEX two thousand and twenty-one ORGANIZERS FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO HAVE
utt_0003 utt 19.98 31.57 -X THESE PRESENTATIONS IN SPITE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE PAPER I'M PRESENTING IS FULL-REFERENCE AND NO-REFERENCE OBJECTIVE EVALUATION OF DEEP NEURAL NETWORK SPEECH.
utt_0005 utt 33.10 44.43 -X DEEP NEURAL NETWORK SPEECH IS SPEECH OF COURSE PRODUCED BY NEURAL NETWORKS AND THEY NEED SOME INPUT. THE SCENARIO I'M LOOKING AT HERE IS WHERE THEY HAVE WHAT WE MIGHT CALL
utt_0007 utt 44.43 49.55 -X CONDITIONING INPUT WHICH COMES FROM A SPEECH ENCODER OF SOME SORT. SO,
utt_0008 utt 49.55 56.40 -X HUMAN SPEECH GOES INTO THE ENCODER. IT PRODUCES SOME INFORMATION AT A LOW RATE THAT ALLOWS A DNN
utt_0009 utt 56.62 65.76 -X TO PRODUCE SPEECH WHICH SOUNDS AN AWFUL LIKE THAT ORIGINAL SPEECH. WE CAN EVALUATE HOW MUCH IT
utt_0010 utt 65.76 73.49 -X SOUNDS LIKE THE ORIGINAL SPEECH USING SUBJECTIVE TESTING OR WITH NO REFERENCE OBJECTIVE TESTS
utt_0011 utt 73.78 79.80 -X OR WITH FULL REFERENCE OBJECTIVE TESTS. AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO JAN SKOGLUND FROM GOOGLE
utt_0012 utt 79.86 88.05 -X WHO HAS SHARED WITH US SOME DATABASES OF REFERENCE SPEECH TEST SPEECH AND SUBJECTIVE
utt_0013 utt 88.88 101.01 -X SCORES THAT GO ALONG WITH THEM. WITHOUT THIS DATA, THIS WORK THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN POSSIBLE. BACK TO WHY THIS WORK. THERE ARE ANECDOTES
utt_0015 utt 101.17 114.52 -X REGARDING THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE FOR MEASURING SPEECH QUALITY FROM DNN SPEECH. ONE SAYS POLQA DID NOT REFLECT INFORMAL LISTENING IMPRESSIONS IN THE CASE OF WAVENET DNN SPEECH AND IT WAS
utt_0017 utt 114.52 125.37 -X A DRAMATIC UNDERESTIMATION. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PUBLISHED ANECDOTES, AND ANECDOTES HEARD AT CONFERENCE, THAT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT OUR FULL REFERENCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS SIMPLY DON'T WORK
utt_0019 utt 125.55 131.57 -X ON DNN SPEECH. I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING ON OUR NO REFERENCE TOOLS. AT THE VERY LAST QOMEX,
utt_0020 utt 131.60 137.05 -X A VERY SPECIFIC STUDY ON THIS TOPIC DOCUMENTED MORE NUMERICALLY IN THE CASE OF
utt_0021 utt 137.27 143.88 -X PESQ AND SEVERAL DNN CODERS THAT INDEED THERE IS A SERIOUS UNDERESTIMATION
utt_0022 utt 144.15 158.21 -X PROBLEM. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE RELIABLE AUTOMATED MEASUREMENTS FOR DNN SPEECH. THEY'RE VERY USEFUL AND IN FACT ONE COULD IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE ESTIMATORS ARE PLACED IN AN ADVERSARIAL POSITION
utt_0024 utt 158.48 165.72 -X WITH DNN SPEECH GENERATORS SO THAT BOTH OF THEM GET BETTER AT THEIR JOBS. THE DATA JAN PROVIDED
utt_0025 utt 165.75 170.39 -X IS FROM FIVE TESTS WHICH COVER CORPORATELY thirty-two CONDITIONS, fourteen OF THEM
utt_0026 utt 171.03 178.78 -X ARE DNN SPEECH GENERATION SOURCES, AND THE OTHER eighteen ARE CONVENTIONAL SPEECH CONDITIONS.
utt_0027 utt 179.28 186.78 -X THEY'RE RATED ON A SUBJECTIVE QUALITY SCALE, one hundred POINT SCALE, MOTIVATED BY THE MUSHROOM.
utt_0028 utt 189.11 204.09 -X I APPLIED thirteen ESTIMATORS, EIGHT OF THEM ARE FULL REFERENCE, AND FIVE ARE NO REFERENCE. NINE OF THESE ARE SPEECH QUALITY ESTIMATORS AND FOUR OF THESE ARE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY ESTIMATORS. THEY ARE LISTED HERE IN THE CHART. CERTAINLY I HAVE APPLIED SOME
utt_0031 utt 204.09 217.54 -X OF THESE OUT OF THEIR INTENDED SCOPE BUT I APPLIED ALL ESTIMATORS TO ALL CONDITIONS FOR UNIFORMITY AND FOR BREADTH. IN EVERY CASE THE I MAP THE ESTIMATOR OUTPUTS USING A SECOND ORDER RELATION
utt_0033 utt 218.00 223.39 -X TO SOMETHING I'M CALLING M HAT, WHICH IS AN APPROXIMATION OF THE SUBJECTIVE VALUE,
utt_0034 utt 223.48 233.05 -X M FOR MUSHROOM. I DID THESE FITS INITIALLY USING JUST THE CONVENTIONAL OR NON-DNN CONDITIONS.
utt_0035 utt 233.14 243.51 -X HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLE RESULTS. SCATTER PLOTS OF THE SUBJECTIVE SCORES VERSUS THE OBJECTIVE SCORES,
utt_0036 utt 243.51 250.92 -X POLQA, WHITE-BAND PESQ, AND VISQOL OVER HERE SOME NO REFERENCE ONES. OF COURSE THE NON-DNN
utt_0037 utt 250.97 257.82 -X CONDITIONS, THE BLACK ONES THAT WERE USED IN THE FIT, ARE FALLING NICELY ON THE LINE Y EQUALS X.
utt_0038 utt 257.82 264.57 -X SO IT'S QUITE CLEAR THAT OVER HERE ON THE FULL REFERENCE SIDE, THE DNN CONDITIONS, THE BLUE ONES
utt_0039 utt 264.60 276.17 -X ARE GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED, AND ON THE RIGHT ON THE FULL REFERENCE SIDE THEY'RE GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED, ON THE NO REFERENCE SIDE THEY'RE OVERESTIMATED. IN ADDITION YOU CAN SEE THINGS LIKE
utt_0041 utt 276.17 282.33 -X A TRAINED TEST PAIR HERE WHICH HAVE VERY SIMILAR SUBJECTIVE SCORES INDICATING SOME GOOD ROBUSTNESS
utt_0042 utt 283.45 291.39 -X AND LARGE DIFFERENCE IN THE OBJECTIVE SCORE. NOW, IF WE DO THE FITTING ON ALL THE DATA,
utt_0043 utt 291.39 304.70 -X THESE PICTURES WILL SHIFT OF COURSE, BUT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE DOES NOT CHANGE AND THESE EXAMPLES ARE BORNE OUT ACROSS ALL OF THE ESTIMATORS THAT WE HAVE. MEAN ERROR HERE, RMSS
utt_0045 utt 304.70 316.64 -X ERROR HERE, AND THE ESTIMATOR IS SHOWN THIS WAY. SO THIS IS AN INDICATION OF THAT UNDERESTIMATION BY THE FULL REFERENCE ESTIMATORS AND HERE THE OVERESTIMATION BY THE NO REFERENCE ESTIMATORS.
utt_0047 utt 316.73 329.93 -X IF WE LOOK AT RMS ERROR WE SEE STILL THAT THE DNN CONDITIONS HAVE A MUCH GREATER RMS ERROR THAN THE NON-DNN CONDITIONS. I ALSO DID THE FIT ON ALL OF THE DATA, AND OF COURSE WHAT HAPPENS
utt_0049 utt 329.93 342.80 -X IS WE SHARE THE ERROR HERE BETWEEN THE TWO CATEGORIES, BUT THE UNDERLYING ISSUE DOES NOT GO AWAY AND THE OVER/UNDER TREND DOES NOT GO AWAY. THE ERROR HERE OF COURSE IS ALSO SHARED WHEN
utt_0051 utt 342.80 349.50 -X WE DO THE FIT ON ALL THE DATA, SO CONSISTENT OVER/UNDER ESTIMATION. WE CAN IN FACT TAKE
utt_0052 utt 351.03 356.00 -X A FULL REFERENCE AND A NO REFERENCE AND AVERAGE THEM TO GET WHAT I'M CALLING ESTIMATOR NUMBER fourteen,
utt_0053 utt 356.57 366.98 -X WHICH HAS GREAT PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE ERRORS ARE ESSENTIALLY CANCELING OUT. THIS IS A PRAGMATIC SOLUTION. IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY PLEASING. IT'S A FULL REFERENCE ESTIMATOR
utt_0055 utt 368.38 371.39 -X WITH MAYBE MORE COMPLEXITY THAN ONE WOULD LIKE.
utt_0056 utt 371.68 384.13 -X I ARGUE THAT IF WE HAD MORE DATA WE COULD TRAIN OUR NEW REFERENCE ESTIMATORS FOR BETTER RESULTS ON THE DNN SOURCES. I'M GOING TO NOTE THAT OUR QUALITY INTELLIGIBILITY ESTIMATORS HAD
utt_0058 utt 384.25 390.37 -X NOT VERY DIFFERENT PERFORMANCE FOR THIS DATA AND ALSO OUR FULL REFERENCE AND NO REFERENCE
utt_0059 utt 390.62 401.74 -X ESTIMATORS HAD SIMILAR PERFORMANCE BUT THE CRUX OF THIS THEN IS THE QUESTION WHY DO THE FULL REFERENCE ESTIMATORS UNDERESTIMATE DNN SPEECH. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS
utt_0061 utt 401.74 409.28 -X THIS IS NOT A FAILURE. THE DNN SPEECH IS IN FACT OUT OF SCOPE. FULL REFERENCE ESTIMATORS, INDEED,
utt_0062 utt 409.28 422.21 -X THEY DO SEEK TO AGREE WITH SUBJECTIVE SCORES IN ALL CASES, RIGHT, BECAUSE THEY MODEL HEARING AND JUDGMENT BUT THIS HAS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREMENTAL PROCESS. AN IDEAL ESTIMATOR WOULD
utt_0064 utt 422.21 428.74 -X FULLY EMBODY EVERYTHING THAT HUMANS DO. IT WOULD WORK FOR ALL TECHNOLOGIES. BUT IN REALITY,
utt_0065 utt 428.74 441.63 -X PRACTICAL ESTIMATORS CONTAIN SUFFICIENT MODELING TO COVER EXISTING TELECOM TECHNOLOGIES AND WHEN NEW TECHNOLOGIES COME ON BOARD AND THEY BRING NEW CLASSES OF IMPAIRMENTS, ESTIMATORS MAY FAIL. THIS
utt_0067 utt 441.89 446.82 -X MOTIVE THEN MOTIVATES US TO DO ADDITIONAL MODELING, OR MORE REFINED MODELING,
utt_0068 utt 446.82 457.84 -X SO THAT OUR MODELS ARE COMPLETE ENOUGH TO COVER EVERYTHING OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO MEASURE AND THERE'S HISTORICAL EXAMPLES OF THIS CYCLE. JUST FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WENT FROM CIRCUIT SWITCH TO
utt_0070 utt 457.84 470.66 -X PACKET SWITCHED TRANSPORT, NEW IMPAIRMENTS CAME UP. NEW TOOLS HAD TO BE DEVELOPED OR FROM WIRELESS TO FROM WIRED TO WIRELESS OR NARROWBAND TO THE BROADER BANDWIDTHS. BUT WHY DO WE HAVE THIS ISSUE?
utt_0072 utt 470.66 477.16 -X WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE MISSING? WELL, FROM THE LITERATURE, THIS UNDERESTIMATION IS NOT EXPECTED.
utt_0073 utt 477.16 488.15 -X WE'RE CHANGING THE WAVEFORM AND THE TIMING OF THE PHONES. MICRO ALIGNMENT TIME SHIFTS PITCH ACCURACY SO I PUT ALL THESE UNDER JITTER, SOME VARIATION IN TIMING. AND I ALSO HEARD WHAT I'M CALLING POWER
utt_0075 utt 488.15 495.52 -X MATCHING. THAT IS SOME SYLLABLE SOUND OVER OR UNDER EMPHASIZE THAT IS THE PROCEDURE'S A BIT OFF.
utt_0076 utt 497.22 503.20 -X SO AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE JITTER THEORY. I DID THIS FOR WIDE-BAND PESQ AND VISQOL,
utt_0077 utt 503.20 512.21 -X WHICH ALREADY HAVE SOME ABILITY TO TO DEAL WITH VARIABLE DELAY OR TIMING ISSUES. I ADDED MORE. SO
utt_0078 utt 512.21 523.46 -X RIGHT NOW THE PICTURE IS ORIGINALLY, THE PICTURE IS, thirty-two MILLISECOND FRAMES FOR EXAMPLE WITH fifty PERCENT OVERLAP AND FRAMES FOR THE REFERENCE SPEECH ARE PAIRED OFF WITH FRAMES
utt_0080 utt 523.46 529.45 -X FOR THE TEST SPEECH AND THEY'RE COMPARED. I ADDED MANY MORE FRAMES ON THE TEST SPEECH,
utt_0081 utt 529.45 536.84 -X SO A TWO SAMPLE STRIDE, ninety-nine POINT SOMETHING PERCENT OVERLAP, AND AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH ALGORITHM
utt_0082 utt 536.93 542.82 -X UNDER SOME CONSTRAINTS ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THE SEARCH AND MONOTONICITY, OF COURSE,
utt_0083 utt 542.82 556.58 -X SO THAT EACH OF THESE REFERENCE FRAMES IS PAIRED UP WITH THE BEST TEST FRAME. YOU CAN SEE THAT ALLOWS FOR MUCH MORE ACCOMMODATION OF TIMING AND THE RESULT WAS THAT HERE ARE THE DNN
utt_0085 utt 557.76 571.34 -X SOURCES IN YELLOW AND NON-DNN HERE. WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY BUT THERE WAS A GREAT UPTICK IN THESE SCORES FOR THESE DNN CASES AND NO CHANGE IN THE SCORE FOR THE NON-DNN CASE,
utt_0087 utt 571.34 585.58 -X SO THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. WE'RE REMOVING JITTER AND BOOSTING THE SCORES IN THE ONE CASE BUT NOT IN THE OTHER. THIS WOULD INDICATE THAT SOME NEARLY INAUDIBLE JITTER IS PRESENT
utt_0089 utt 585.58 600.39 -X BUT THE FULL REFERENCE ESTIMATORS ARE PENALIZING IT MUCH SERIOUSLY. THE EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE POWER MATCHING THEORY IS SIMILAR. MEASURING POWER FOR THE REFERENCE AND TEST SPEECH PER FRAME AND
utt_0091 utt 600.52 607.71 -X CALCULATING A PER FRAME CORRECTION FACTOR AND APPLYING IT GIVES AN ADDITIONAL LITTLE BOOST ON
utt_0092 utt 607.71 621.39 -X THE SCORES AND THAT BOOST IS IS MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THE DNN CASES AND LESS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE NON-DNN CASES. SO AGAIN I BELIEVE THIS INDICATES THAT POWER MATCHING IS AN ISSUE.
utt_0094 utt 624.93 637.26 -X SO IN SUMMARY, WE'VE DOCUMENTED THE ISSUE MORE BROADLY AND NUMERICALLY THAN PREVIOUSLY AND SEEN THIS CONSISTENT UNDERESTIMATION/OVERESTIMATION PROPOSED THAT ONE CAN ACTUALLY COMBINE THEM
utt_0096 utt 637.26 642.67 -X AND WE SHOW IN THE PAPER THAT WE GET REALLY GOOD RESULTS THAT WAY, ALSO
utt_0097 utt 643.62 652.20 -X ARGUING THAT WITH MORE DATA ONE COULD TRAIN MEL BASED NO REFERENCE ESTIMATORS TO DO BETTER ON THIS
utt_0098 utt 652.20 663.63 -X CASE. BUT THE BULK OF THE WORK HERE IS ABOUT THIS F FULL REFERENCE UNDERESTIMATION ISSUE, AND AGAIN TO BE CLEAR, THAT I'M NOT POINTING OUT A FAILURE. I'M SAYING WE NEED TO GO THROUGH ANOTHER ONE OF
utt_0100 utt 663.63 669.88 -X THESE CYCLES. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE THAT OUR CURRENT MODELING OF HUMAN HEARING AND JUDGMENT
utt_0101 utt 671.53 678.06 -X IS NOT TAKING ACCOUNT OF OR MAYBE IT'S TAKING TOO MUCH ACCOUNT OF IT. WE'RE TOO SENSITIVE TO JITTER,
utt_0102 utt 678.31 685.58 -X TOO SENSITIVE TO POWER MISMATCHES, BUT VERY IMPORTANT. WHAT I'VE DONE HERE ARE DEMONSTRATIONS.
utt_0103 utt 685.58 697.84 -X THEY'RE NOT PROPOSED FIXES. WE SHOULD NOT GO SLAP THESE THINGS INTO OUR ESTIMATORS. WE SHOULD NOT REMOVE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OR UNLIMITED POWER FLUCTUATIONS WITHOUT SOME PENALTY
utt_0105 utt 697.84 702.67 -X THIS TO THE SCORE, RIGHT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE NEED TO PENALIZE WHEN WE DO THIS.
utt_0106 utt 703.05 715.34 -X REAL FIXES ARE FULLY INTEGRATED OPTIMIZED CALIBRATED TESTED BROADLY SO WE'RE PROVIDING SOME INFORMATION THAT WE HOPE CAN LEAD TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.
