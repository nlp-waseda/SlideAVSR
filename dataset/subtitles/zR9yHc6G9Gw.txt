utt_0000 utt 0.35 6.64 -X WELCOME TO THIS VIDEO WHERE WE WILL STUDY THE UNDERLYING ORIGIN OF THE DECISION COSTS IN ML-EDM
utt_0001 utt 9.64 12.08 -X THIS IS THE LAST VIDEO OF THIS SERIES,
utt_0002 utt 12.08 15.89 -X WHICH PRESENTS THE IDEAS OF THE FOUNDING PAPER OF THIS NEW RESEARCH AREA.
utt_0003 utt 17.45 21.49 -X THIS SLIDE SHOWS A SUMMARY OF THE CHALLENGES PROPOSED IN THIS PAPER,
utt_0004 utt 21.87 24.62 -X AND WHICH WERE PRESENTED IN THE PREVIOUS VIDEOS.
utt_0005 utt 25.26 37.07 -X THIS VIDEO PRESENTS THE LAST CHALLENGE WHICH CONSIDERS TIME VARYING DECISION COSTS. IN ORDER TO PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THIS CHALLENGE, WE MUST FIRST STUDY THE DEEP ORIGIN OF DECISION COSTS.
utt_0007 utt 38.61 48.53 -X IN THE PREVIOUS VIDEOS, AN IMPORTANT STEP WAS MISSING, WHICH OCCURS RIGHT AFTER A DECISION IS TRIGGERED. WHEN A DECISION IS TRIGGERED, THE SYSTEM
utt_0009 utt 48.53 55.38 -X PREDICTS A LABEL AND LAUNCHES THE EXECUTION OF A TASK, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE PREDICTED CLASS.
utt_0010 utt 55.60 59.12 -X THIS TASK MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE DEADLINE CAPITAL T.
utt_0011 utt 60.43 70.29 -X IN THE CASE OF EARLY CLASSIFICATION, THE DECISION COSTS WERE CONSIDERED AS INPUTS TO THE ALGORITHMS. NAMELY, IT IS THE MISCLASSIFICATION COST,
utt_0013 utt 70.29 77.39 -X WHICH IS A MATRIX AND TO WHICH IS ADDED THE DELAY COST, WHICH IS A TIME DEPENDENT FUNCTION.
utt_0014 utt 77.45 90.87 -X TO UNDERSTAND THE DEEP MEANING OF THE DECISION COSTS, IT IS NECESSARY TO DETAIL THE TASK TO BE PERFORMED MORE PRECISELY. THIS TASK IS IN FACT A DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPH COMPOSED OF ELEMENTARY
utt_0016 utt 90.87 104.28 -X ACTIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE NODES OF THE GRAPH. THESE ELEMENTARY ACTIONS HAVE DEPENDENCIES WHICH ARE REPRESENTED BY THE ARCS OF THE GRAPH. THESE DAGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PREDICTED
utt_0018 utt 104.28 108.18 -X CLASS AND MUST BE EXECUTED BEFORE THE DEADLINE CAPITAL T.
utt_0019 utt 109.46 112.53 -X LET US NOW STUDY THE MEANING OF THE DELAY COST.
utt_0020 utt 112.94 123.96 -X IF WE CONSIDER A PARTICULAR VALUE OF THE FUNCTION, THIS VALUE CORRESPONDS TO THE COST OF EXECUTING THE DAG OF TASKS IN THE TIME REMAINING BEFORE THE DEADLINE CAPITAL T.
utt_0022 utt 124.62 132.72 -X IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO EXECUTE THE DAG OF TASKS, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE PREDICTED CLASS.
utt_0024 utt 132.72 138.36 -X USING THIS DEFINITION, WE FIND OUT THAT THE DELAY COST SHOULD DEPEND ON THE PREDICTED CLASS,
utt_0025 utt 138.36 142.16 -X WHICH IS NOT THE CASE IN THE LITERATURE.
utt_0026 utt 142.16 147.12 -X LET US NOW MOVE TO THE STAGE WHERE THE DAG IS EXECUTED IN A LIMITED TIME.
utt_0027 utt 147.73 161.33 -X WE CAN OBSERVE THAT THE LATER THE DECISION IS TRIGGERED, THE LESS TIME IS LEFT TO EXECUTE THE DAG OF TASKS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE EXECUTION TIME OF THE DAG, IT IS POSSIBLE TO PARALLELIZE IT.
utt_0029 utt 162.29 169.97 -X TO DO THIS, WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS, EACH OF WHICH EXECUTES A SUBTASK.
utt_0030 utt 169.97 174.01 -X THEN, THE SUB-RESULTS ARE COMBINED TO FORM THE FINAL RESULT OF A TASK.
utt_0031 utt 174.48 188.69 -X THIS LAST STEP CAN BE EXTREMELY COSTLY IF THE NUMBER OF WORKERS IS VERY LARGE. WE CAN MAKE THE ANALOGY WITH MAP / REDUCE WHICH WAS USED WHEN HADOOP WAS VERY POPULAR. TECHNICALLY,
utt_0033 utt 188.69 192.34 -X THIS PARALLELIZATION COST CANNOT BE AVOIDED.
utt_0034 utt 192.34 196.82 -X ALL THIS EXPLAINS THE SHAPE OF THE CURVE WHICH DEFINES THE DELAY COST.
utt_0035 utt 196.82 199.51 -X THIS FUNCTION IS NECESSARILY INCREASING OVER TIME,
utt_0036 utt 200.24 204.73 -X SINCE THE LESS TIME LEFT TO RUN THE DAG, THE MORE WORKERS ARE NEEDED.
utt_0037 utt 206.10 212.82 -X FINALLY, THIS FUNCTION SHOULD EVEN TENDS TOWARDS INFINITY, WHEN THE DEADLINE CAPITAL T IS REACHED.
utt_0038 utt 215.03 219.61 -X LET US NOW STUDY THE UNDERLYING ORIGIN OF THE COST OF CHANGING DECISIONS.
utt_0039 utt 219.76 223.57 -X AS A REMINDER, THE COST OF CHANGING A DECISION TAKES THE FORM OF A MATRIX.
utt_0040 utt 223.79 230.33 -X EACH CELL IN THIS MATRIX GIVES THE COST OF A DECISION CHANGE, GIVEN THE PREVIOUS DECISION.
utt_0041 utt 231.38 234.81 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE ZOOM IN ON A CELL OF THE MATRIX,
utt_0042 utt 235.22 241.21 -X THE VALUE CORRESPONDS TO THE COST OF CHANGING THE DAG OF TASKS TO BE EXECUTED.
utt_0043 utt 241.21 246.81 -X IN THIS CASE, THE EXECUTION OF THE DAG ASSOCIATED WITH CLASS A HAS ALREADY BEGUN,
utt_0044 utt 247.12 252.98 -X THEN THIS DECISION IS REVOKED AND THE EXECUTION OF THE DAG CORRESPONDING TO CLASS B BEGINS.
utt_0045 utt 254.74 269.62 -X MORE PRECISELY, THE COST OF CHANGING THE DECISION IS THE SUM OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TASKS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED IN THE DAG CORRESPONDING TO CLASS A AND WHICH CANNOT BE REUSED TO EXECUTE THE DAG OF CLASS B.
utt_0048 utt 270.90 276.06 -X SOME TASKS CAN BE REUSED, AS IT IS THE CASE OF TASK two WHICH APPEARS IN BLUE.
utt_0050 utt 277.40 289.46 -X FROM THIS DEFINITION, IT APPEARS THAT THE COST OF CHANGING DECISIONS SHOULD DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN LEFT ON THE PREVIOUS DECISION. INDEED, THE MORE TIME ELAPSES BETWEEN
utt_0052 utt 289.46 297.53 -X THE DECISION AND ITS REVOCATION, THE MORE TASKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED IN THE PREVIOUS DAG OF TASKS.
utt_0053 utt 297.53 306.81 -X NOW WE COME TO THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS VIDEO: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE DAG OF TASKS TO BE EXECUTED DEPENDS ON BOTH THE PREDICTED CLASS AND THE TRIGGER TIME?
utt_0055 utt 306.81 313.91 -X IN THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION, THE CONSIDERED TIME PERIOD IS SPLIT INTO THREE SUB-PERIODS CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT REGIMES.
utt_0057 utt 315.16 319.64 -X IF THE DECISION IS TRIGGERED EARLY ENOUGH AND CLASS A IS PREDICTED,
utt_0058 utt 319.73 322.11 -X THE NOMINAL OPERATION REGIME APPLIES.
utt_0059 utt 322.68 331.61 -X IN THIS CASE, THE DAG OF TASKS IS COMPLETE AND CORRESPONDS TO THE NORMAL OPERATION OF OUR SYSTEM.
utt_0060 utt 331.61 342.49 -X IF THE DECISION IS TRIGGERED A LITTLE LATER, THE DAG OF TASKS IS SIMPLIFIED BECAUSE IT MUST BE EXECUTED UNDER TIME CONSTRAINTS, AND IT CANNOT NECESSARILY BE PARALLELIZED.
utt_0062 utt 343.73 354.71 -X FINALLY, IF THE DECISION IS TRIGGERED VERY LATE, IT CORRESPONDS TO A HIGHLY DETERIORATED OPERATION OF OUR SYSTEM, AND THE DAG OF TASKS TO BE EXECUTED IS EVEN MORE SIMPLIFIED.
utt_0064 utt 354.77 358.49 -X THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE EXAMPLE OF A PLANE LANDING.
utt_0065 utt 358.87 369.59 -X IF THIS DECISION IS LARGELY ANTICIPATED, IT IS A NORMAL LANDING, WHERE THE DAG OF TASKS IS COMPLETE AND INCLUDES ALL THE SAFETY STEPS, BOTH FOR THE PASSENGERS AND FOR THE AIRCRAFT.
utt_0067 utt 370.49 373.02 -X IF THE DECISION TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT IS LATER,
utt_0068 utt 373.02 379.04 -X THE PILOT IS FORCED TO SIMPLIFY THE DAG OF TASKS. THE LANDING WILL BE TURBULENT AND THEREFORE
utt_0069 utt 379.16 384.86 -X UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE PASSENGERS, AND NOT ALL THE PROCEDURES FOR CHECKING THE AIRCRAFT WILL BE DONE.
utt_0070 utt 386.23 387.13 -X FINALLY,
utt_0071 utt 387.13 401.79 -X IF IT IS A VERY LATE DECISION, WE ARE FACING A REAL EMERGENCY LANDING. THE PILOT IS ABLE TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT AND SAVE ALL THE PASSENGERS, BUT THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE COSTLY MATERIAL DAMAGES.
utt_0073 utt 403.26 409.53 -X HERE IS THE GENERAL SCHEMA OF THE ML-EDM, WHERE A NEW MODEL APPEARS AT THE END OF THE PROCESS.
utt_0074 utt 409.53 420.09 -X IT IS A SCHEDULING STRATEGY, WHICH PROVIDES THE DAGS OF TASKS ACCORDING TO THE PREDICTED CLASS AND ACCORDING TO THE TRIGGERING TIME. IN OUR PREVIOUS EXAMPLE, THIS PLANNING
utt_0076 utt 420.09 424.60 -X STRATEGY WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE IDEAL BEHAVIOR OF THE PILOT OF THE AIRCRAFT.
utt_0077 utt 425.14 433.47 -X IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AN OPTIMAL DAG TO LAND THE AIRCRAFT, AT ANY TRIGGER TIME.
utt_0078 utt 433.82 438.11 -X FORMALIZING THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM IS VERY DIFFICULT. INDEED,
utt_0079 utt 438.11 443.68 -X THERE IS AN INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE TRIGGERING MODEL AND THE PLANNING STRATEGY.
utt_0080 utt 443.70 450.69 -X ON THE ONE HAND, THE DAG OF TASKS PROVIDED BY THE PLANNING STRATEGY DEFINES THE DECISION COSTS, BY ITS STRUCTURE.
utt_0082 utt 451.74 456.48 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS ALSO A DEPENDENCY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. INDEED,
utt_0083 utt 456.48 465.34 -X THE OPTIMAL TRIGGERING TIME DEPENDS ON THE DECISION COSTS. AND THE DAG PROVIDED BY THE PLANNING STRATEGY ALSO DEPENDS ON THE DECISION TIME.
utt_0085 utt 465.79 472.00 -X FINALLY, THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SOLVE DIRECTLY AND IS CALLED A FIXED POINT
utt_0086 utt 472.12 483.87 -X OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. IN THIS CLASS OF PROBLEM, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO OPTIMIZE A FUNCTION WHICH TAKES AS INPUT THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION.
utt_0088 utt 483.87 487.90 -X IN FUTURE WORK, IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP APPROACHES THAT DIRECTLY
utt_0090 utt 492.19 497.12 -X HOWEVER, A SETTING WHERE THE PLANNING STRATEGY WOULD BE OBSERVED COULD BE CONSIDERED, FOR EXAMPLE BY SIMULATION.
utt_0092 utt 497.53 500.99 -X TYPICALLY, IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, THE DAGS
utt_0093 utt 501.59 507.87 -X PROVIDED BY THE PLANNING STRATEGY COULD BE PART OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THUS OBSERVED.
utt_0094 utt 512.67 520.13 -X TO CONCLUDE THIS VIDEO SERIES, HERE IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHALLENGES WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THE ML-EDM RESEARCH FIELD.
