utt_0000 utt 0.24 3.86 -X HELLO EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN OUR PRESENTATION FOR IROS two thousand and twenty-one
utt_0001 utt 4.59 8.43 -X I AM YASUNORI TOSHIMITSU FROM ETH ZURICH AND THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO
utt_0002 utt 8.91 17.28 -X AND I WILL PRESENT OUR WORK SOPRA: FABRICATION AND DYNAMICAL MODELING OF A SCALABLE SOFT CONTINUUM ROBOTIC ARM WITH INTEGRATED PROPRIOCEPTIVE SENSING
utt_0004 utt 19.76 33.46 -X SO IN OUR WORK WE USE SOFT ROBOTIC ARMS WHICH CAN BE USED AS MANIPULATORS WHILE ENSURING COMPLIANCE AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL. PAST RESEARCH DONE ON SOFT ROBOTIC ARMS INCLUDE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTACT EXPERIMENTS WHERE THE ARM COMPLIANTLY TRACES ALONG A SURFACE,
utt_0007 utt 33.71 37.91 -X DYNAMIC CLOSED LOOP MOTION CONTROL WHERE THE ARM FOLLOWS A DYNAMIC TREACHERY,
utt_0008 utt 38.19 47.70 -X OR HUMAN ROBOT CORPORATION. SUCH ROBOTS CAN SAFELY INTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT WITH MORE COMPLIANCE THAN RIGID LINKED ROBOTS AND THUS IS FAVORABLE AROUND HUMANS.
utt_0010 utt 48.56 52.95 -X LET'S COMPARE CONVENTIONAL RIGID LINK ROBOTS AND SOFT ROBOTIC ARMS.
utt_0011 utt 53.97 59.70 -X WE CAN ROUGHLY CATEGORIZE RIGID ARMS INTO POSITION CONTROLLED ARMS AND TORQUE CONTROLLED ARMS.
utt_0012 utt 60.18 70.52 -X THE TWO METRICS THAT WE COMPARE HERE ARE THE COMPLIANCE, OR HOW SOFT THE ROBOT IS, AND HOW MODELABLE AND CONTROLLABLE IT IS. COMPLIANCE IS IMPORTANT FOR BEHAVIORS THAT INVOLVE CONTACT WITH
utt_0014 utt 70.52 80.41 -X THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR SAFETY. THE MODELABILITY AND CONTROLLABILITY IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT AS A ROBOT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS HOW EFFECTIVELY YOU CAN CONTROL IT TO
utt_0016 utt 80.41 91.80 -X EXECUTE TASKS. FOR POSITION CONTROLLED ARMS THEY ARE RIGIDLY CONTROLLED BUT THEY CAN EMULATE SOME COMPLIANCE THROUGH IMPEDANCE CONTROL. FOR TORQUE CONTROLLED ARMS, EACH MOTOR IMPLEMENTS TORQUE
utt_0018 utt 91.80 96.69 -X CONTROL WHICH IS INHERENTLY COMPLIANT. HOWEVER THE HARDWARE ITSELF IS STILL RIGID AND HEAVY.
utt_0019 utt 98.26 108.92 -X THE MODELING AND CONTROL OF THESE RIGID ARMS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY RESEARCHED AND THERE ARE MANY EFFECTIVE METHODS TO CONTROL IT. SOFT ROBOTS ARE COMPLIANT AT THE MATERIAL LEVEL SO IT IS THE
utt_0021 utt 108.92 120.73 -X MOST COMPLIANT AND SAFEST AMONG THESE ROBOTS. HOWEVER THE MODELING IN CONTROL OF THESE ROBOTS IS NOT NEARLY AS THOROUGHLY REALIZED AS THAT OF RIGID ROBOTS. SO IN THIS WORK, BY DEVELOPING
utt_0023 utt 120.73 127.35 -X THE DESIGN IN TANDEM WITH ITS DYNAMICAL MODEL WE TRY TO IMPROVE THE MODELABILITY OF SOFT ROBOTS.
utt_0024 utt 127.51 130.52 -X HERE I WILL GO OVER SOME OF THE WORKS RELATED TO FABRICATION,
utt_0025 utt 130.52 132.66 -X SENSING, AND MODELING OF PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS.
utt_0026 utt 133.17 138.30 -X FIRST IS THIS RESEARCH FOR THE FABRICATION AND MODELING OF FIBER-REINFORCED PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS.
utt_0027 utt 138.77 144.35 -X THEY HAVE CREATED AN ANALYTICAL MODEL DESCRIBING THE BENDING OF FIBER REINFORCED ACTUATORS,
utt_0028 utt 144.66 149.08 -X AND WE HAVE REFERRED TO THIS WORK EXTENSIVELY WHEN FORMULATING OUR MODEL AS WELL.
utt_0029 utt 149.40 159.35 -X NEXT, THIS PAPER FROM OUR GROUP IMPLEMENTED DYNAMIC CLOSED LOOP CONTROL ON A SPATIAL SOFT ROBOTIC ARM WHERE WE USED AN AUGMENTED RIGID ARM FOR COMPUTING DYNAMIC PARAMETERS.
utt_0031 utt 160.15 170.65 -X FINALLY IN THIS WORK THEY HAVE ATTACHED KIRIGAMI STYLE CONDUCTIVE SENSORS TO THE SKIN OF THE ROBOT FOR INTEGRATED PROPRIOCEPTIVE SENSING. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHLY NONLINEAR NATURE OF THE READOUTS
utt_0033 utt 170.65 176.16 -X FROM THESE SENSORS, A NEURAL NETWORK WAS USED FOR INTERPOLATING THE SENSOR SIGNALS FROM THE SENSORS.
utt_0034 utt 179.16 189.72 -X HERE ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS WORK. WE HAVE DERIVED AN ANALYTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL FOR DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOR OF FIBER-REINFORCED SOFT ROBOTS. WE HAVE PROPOSED
utt_0036 utt 189.72 194.97 -X A METHOD TO EMBED FLEX SENSORS INTO A SOFT ROBOT TO TAKE PROPRIOCEPTIVE MEASUREMENTS.
utt_0037 utt 195.06 203.58 -X FINALLY WE PROPOSE A FORMULATION WHICH CAN COMBINE THE MEASUREMENTS FROM THE PROPRIOCEPTIVE SENSORS AND THE DYNAMIC MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE LOAD HELD BY THE GRIPPER.
utt_0039 utt 204.15 216.03 -X FOR THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION I WILL EXPLAIN OUR APPROACH BASED ON THE THREE DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR SOPRA, THE SOFT CONTINUUM PROPRIOCEPTIVE ARM. THE FIRST ONE IS GEOMETRIC SCALABILITY.
utt_0041 utt 216.76 226.27 -X THE ARM HAS TO BE EASY TO ADAPT TO DIFFERENT SIZES AND NUMBERS OF SEGMENTS WE MUST EXPLORE HOW TO VARY THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SHAPE FOR EACH SEGMENT WHILE RETAINING THE SAME FABRICATION METHOD
utt_0043 utt 228.19 236.58 -X HERE IS AN OVERVIEW OF SOPRA'S DESIGN. THREE FIBER REINFORCED CHAMBERS ARE COMBINED WITH A FLEX SENSOR TO FORM A SINGLE ACTUATED SEGMENT.
utt_0045 utt 236.92 241.41 -X THE CENTER OF A SEGMENT ALSO CONTAINS AIR TUNNELS WHICH CONNECT TO THE DISTAL CHAMBERS.
utt_0046 utt 242.56 246.27 -X THESE threeD PRINTED CONNECTOR PIECES ROUTE THE AIR TUNNELS BETWEEN SEGMENTS.
utt_0047 utt 246.65 258.78 -X THE SEGMENTS ARE THEN COMBINED WITH A SOFT PLEATED GRIPPER AND A BASE PIECE TO FORM THE COMPLETED ARM. NEXT I WILL EXPLAIN THE FABRICATION PROCEDURE OF CREATING THE ARM FROM SILICONE.
utt_0049 utt 259.16 265.35 -X FIRST WE FABRICATE EACH FIBER REINFORCED CHAMBER. HERE ARE THE threeD PRINTED MOLDS USED FOR CASTING.
utt_0050 utt 265.60 270.24 -X AFTER POURING AND CURING THE SILICONE, WE MANUALLY WRAP FIBERS AROUND THE CHAMBERS.
utt_0051 utt 270.75 274.53 -X WE'VE TESTED OUR ARM WITH BOTH FISHING WIRES AND SEWING THREADS.
utt_0052 utt 276.16 286.72 -X NEXT WE PREPARED THE FLEX SENSOR AND THE CABLES. WE USED THESE FLEX SENSORS FROM BEND LABS WHICH OUTPUTS A LINEAR MEASUREMENT OF THE BENDING ANGLE. WE WILL EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE SENSOR
utt_0054 utt 286.72 292.07 -X MODEL IN A FUTURE SLIDE. WE CONNECT THE SENSOR CABLE AND THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS TOGETHER.
utt_0055 utt 292.22 304.45 -X THE SENSORS CAN BE DAISY CHAINED ACROSS SEGMENTS, SO WE HAVE FOUR WIRES RUNNING ALONG THE ARM WITH THE GROUND, VCC AND TWO ItwoC SIGNAL CHANNELS SHARED ACROSS ALL OF THE SEGMENTS. FINALLY WE
utt_0057 utt 304.45 308.93 -X WRAP THE SENSOR WITH FABRIC FOR PROTECTION FROM SILICONE AND TO PREVENT LENGTHWISE STRETCHING
utt_0058 utt 311.17 316.45 -X NEXT WE ASSEMBLE THREE CHAMBERS AND THE SENSORS TOGETHER TO CREATE A SINGLE ACTUATED SEGMENT.
utt_0059 utt 316.96 321.68 -X NOTE THAT HERE WE USE THESE THREE MILLIMETER RODS IN ORDER TO FORM THE AIR SUPPLY LINES
utt_0060 utt 322.18 325.93 -X WE USE SILICONE BONDING TO BOND THE THREE CHAMBERS TOGETHER
utt_0061 utt 328.71 338.93 -X FINALLY WE ASSEMBLE IT INTO A SINGLE ARM BY USING THESE SLA PRINTED CONNECTORS. THESE HAVE INTEGRATED AIR PATHWAYS WHICH ROUTE THE AIR TUBES ACROSS SEGMENTS
utt_0063 utt 341.67 353.45 -X THE NEXT DESIGN PRINCIPLE IS ANALYTIC MODAL ABILITY. WE DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL DYNAMICAL MODEL THAT CLOSELY MATCHES THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE ARM. ALTHOUGH IT IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF
utt_0065 utt 353.45 364.14 -X THIS PARTICULAR PAPER THIS COULD BE USED IN MODAL BASED CONTROLLERS FOR SOFT ROBOTS UNLOCKING NEW BEHAVIORS FOR THESE TYPES OF ROBOTS. HERE'S THE DYNAMIC MODEL OF SOPRA. THE FIRST TERM
utt_0067 utt 364.14 368.52 -X IS THE PRESSURE INPUT TO EACH CHAMBER AND THE SECOND TERM IS THE EXTERNAL FORCE AT THE TIP.
utt_0068 utt 369.89 379.88 -X THEN THESE THREE TERMS ARE THE DYNAMIC PARAMETERS CALCULATED FROM THE AUGMENTED RIGID BODY MODEL BASED ON THE PREVIOUS PUBLICATION. I'LL BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW THESE WERE DERIVED
utt_0070 utt 381.67 392.36 -X THE AUGMENTED RIGIDBODY MODEL APPROXIMATES THE KINEMATICS AND DYNAMICS OF THE SOFT ROBOT THROUGH A SERIES OF ROTATIONAL AND PRISMATIC JOINTS. THE DYNAMIC PARAMETERS OF THIS MODEL,
utt_0072 utt 392.36 403.93 -X SUCH AS THE INITIAL MATRIX OR THE CENTRIFUGAL AND CORIOLIS FORCES CAN BE CALCULATED WITH STANDARD ROBOTICS LIBRARIES, SINCE THIS IS A CONVENTIONAL ROBOTIC LINK CHAIN. THEY ARE THEN MAPPED TO THE
utt_0074 utt 403.93 409.35 -X ORIGINAL SOFT ROBOT WHICH IS MODELED AS A SERIES OF PIECEWISE CONSTANT CURVATURE, OR PCC SEGMENTS.
utt_0075 utt 409.83 422.12 -X THEY ARE MAPPED USING THE JACOBIAN BETWEEN XI WHICH IS THE JOINT ANGLES OF THE RIGID MODEL AND Q THE PCC PARAMETERIZATION OF THE SOFT ROBOT. THEY ARE CONVERTED USING THE EQUATIONS LISTED HERE
utt_0077 utt 423.91 428.72 -X NEXT I WILL EXPLAIN HOW WE HAVE CALCULATED THE FORCES ARISING FROM THE SILICON PROPERTIES.
utt_0078 utt 428.97 433.71 -X THEY WERE DERIVED FROM AN ANALYTICAL MODEL OF SOFT SILICON MATERIAL'S BENDING.
utt_0079 utt 434.70 442.57 -X FOR NEO- HOOKEAN MODELS THE STRESS S ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL DIRECTION WHEN THE SILICONE IS STRETCHED LAMBDA IS MODELED AS SUCH.
utt_0081 utt 443.85 448.91 -X THEN FOR A PIECE BENDING AT A CONSTANT CURVATURE, WHEN THE BENDING ANGLE IS THETA,
utt_0082 utt 448.91 454.19 -X THE STRETCH AT DISTANCE X FROM THE NEUTRAL BENDING PLANE CAN THEN BE MODELED WITH THIS EQUATION
utt_0083 utt 458.06 470.43 -X BY INTEGRATING THE STRESS S OVER THE ENTIRE CROSS SECTION WE CAN GET THE BENDING MOMENT ME CAUSED BY THE STIFFNESS OF THE SILICONE MATERIAL. HERE THE FABRIC FIBER REINFORCEMENT LIMITS THE STRETCHING
utt_0085 utt 470.43 475.54 -X IN THE RADIAL DIRECTION AND ALLOWS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CROSS-SECTIONAL SHAPE IS ALWAYS CONSTANT.
utt_0086 utt 477.00 480.40 -X SO HERE WE SEE THAT THIS IS LINEAR FOR THE BENDING ANGLE THETA,
utt_0087 utt 480.40 483.54 -X THUS ENABLING A LINEAR MODEL FOR THE BENDING STIFFNESS
utt_0088 utt 486.22 496.88 -X IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE HAVE VERIFIED THE ACCURACY OF THE DYNAMIC MODEL THROUGH FEED-FORWARD ACTUATION. THE SAME PRESSURE WAS INPUT INTO THE PHYSICAL ROBOT AND THE DYNAMIC MODEL,
utt_0090 utt 496.88 499.66 -X AND THE TIP POSITION ERROR BETWEEN THEM WAS MEASURED.
utt_0091 utt 499.95 505.23 -X WE CAN SEE THAT THE MODEL COULD PREDICT THE TIP POSITION AT AROUND TWO CENTIMETER ACCURACY
utt_0092 utt 508.49 520.48 -X FINALLY THE LAST DESIGN PRINCIPLE IS FOR THE ARM TO HAVE FULL PROPRIOCEPTION. SOPRA HAS INTERNAL SENSORS THAT CAN TAKE PROPRIOCEPTIVE MEASUREMENTS OF THE ARM POSE. SOFT ROBOTIC ARMS ARE OFTEN
utt_0094 utt 520.48 530.10 -X DEPENDENT ON EXTERNAL MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEMS TO TAKE MEASUREMENTS OF THE ARM POSE. THESE SENSORS CAN BE USED EVEN WHEN MOCAP SYSTEMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, IMPROVING INDEPENDENCE OF THE ARM
utt_0096 utt 531.82 541.36 -X THE BAND LABS SENSOR THAT WE HAVE USED HAS AN OUTPUT THAT IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE SENSOR PATH THE MEASUREMENT ONLY DEPENDS ON THE RELATIVE ORIENTATION BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END,
utt_0098 utt 541.36 552.58 -X SO THE TWO SENSOR SHAPES HERE WOULD OUTPUT THE SAME SIGNAL. WE HAVE FORMULATED OUR MODEL TO HAVE THREE PCC SEGMENTS SPANNING ACROSS A SINGLE FLEX SENSOR, THUS THE MEASUREMENT
utt_0100 utt 552.58 557.88 -X BY THE SENSOR S CAN BE DESCRIBED AS THE SUM OF THE BENDING ANGLE OF EACH PCC ELEMENT.
utt_0101 utt 558.83 567.09 -X THUS THIS CAN BE EXPANDED INTO A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SENSOR MEASUREMENT VECTOR S AND THE POSE Q OF THE SOFT ENTIRE SOFT ROBOT
utt_0103 utt 569.87 574.13 -X THUS IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE STATE OF THE ROBOT FROM SENSOR MEASUREMENTS ALONE
utt_0104 utt 583.83 598.62 -X IN THIS EXPERIMENT WE ESTIMATE THE LOAD AT THE TIP OF THE ARM BY COMBINING SENSOR MEASUREMENTS AND THE DYNAMIC MODEL BY SOLVING THESE LINEAR EQUATIONS. UNDER THE CONSTRAINT DERIVED FROM THE SENSOR MEASUREMENTS, WE CAN OBTAIN THE BEST GUESS OF THE EXTERNAL FORCE AT THE TIP
utt_0107 utt 599.06 609.30 -X THE EXPERIMENT WAS DONE IN FOUR DIFFERENT POSTURES AND THE RESULTS ARE SHOWN HERE. IT CAN BE SEEN THAT IT HAS ACHIEVED CONSISTENT ESTIMATES ACROSS DIFFERENT POSTURES AND DIFFERENT OBJECTS.
utt_0109 utt 609.46 622.20 -X HOWEVER THE ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE WEIGHT ESTIMATES WERE OFF BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF TWO. SO THESE WERE THE THREE DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR OUR ROBOT ARM SOPRA. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT ON SOPRA BY
utt_0111 utt 622.20 627.48 -3.3519 IMPROVING ITS HARDWARE ROBUSTNESS AS WELL AS THE MODEL ACCURACY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING
