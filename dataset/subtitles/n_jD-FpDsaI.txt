utt_0000 utt 3.53 13.39 -X HELLO EVERYONE THIS IS THE INTRODUCTION TO OUR PAPER TASK CONDITIONED DOMAIN ADAPTATION FOR PEDESTRIAN DETECTION IN THERMAL IMAGERY
utt_0002 utt 14.83 19.06 -X AS WE KNOW STATE-OF-THE-ART RGB DETECTORS,
utt_0003 utt 19.06 23.38 -X LIKE YOLO VERSION three, ARE EXTREMELY FAST AND ACCURATE.
utt_0004 utt 23.79 26.77 -X HOWEVER WITHOUT DOMAIN ADAPTATION,
utt_0005 utt 26.77 29.97 -X THEY CANNOT DETECT IN CHALLENGING CONDITIONS,
utt_0006 utt 30.09 34.26 -X LIKE NIGHT TIME, AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0007 utt 36.46 42.10 -X AND WITHOUT CAREFUL DOMAIN ADAPTATION, THEY ALSO CANNOT DETECT IN THE THERMAL DOMAIN.
utt_0008 utt 42.10 44.18 -X AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO ON THE LEFT.
utt_0009 utt 44.88 47.57 -X ONE OF THE MOST STANDARD APPROACHES IS
utt_0010 utt 47.73 51.25 -X TO FINE-TUNE YOLO Vthree ON THE THERMAL DOMAIN,
utt_0011 utt 51.44 57.33 -X WHICH CAN RESULT IN ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE, AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0012 utt 60.05 64.88 -X BASED ON YOLO VERSION three DETECTOR WITH THE THERMAL INPUT IMAGE
utt_0013 utt 65.39 68.43 -X AND THE OUTPUT WITH three DETECTION SCALES,
utt_0014 utt 68.65 70.87 -X AS WE CAN SEE IN THE FIGURE.
utt_0015 utt 71.92 83.41 -X WE PROPOSE A TASK-CONDITIONED NETWORK BY ADDING AN AUXILIARY NETWORK INTO THE MAIN DETECTOR TO CONDITION THE REPRESENTATION.
utt_0017 utt 84.34 87.57 -X THE KEY IDEA BEHIND OUR TECHNIQUE IS
utt_0018 utt 87.92 95.86 -X TO ADAPT AN RGB-TRAINED DETECTOR TO SIMULTANEOUSLY SOLVE TWO RELATED TASKS.
utt_0019 utt 95.86 99.12 -X (CLASSIFICATION TASK AND DETECTION TASK)
utt_0020 utt 100.27 105.36 -X AND THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION LEARNED TO PERFORM THIS CLASSIFICATION TASK
utt_0021 utt 106.16 113.43 -X IS USED TO CONDITION A REPRESENTATION IN THE MAIN DETECTOR AT MULTIPLE POINTS
utt_0022 utt 113.74 117.91 -X IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ITS ADAPTATION TO THE THERMAL DOMAIN
utt_0023 utt 119.50 124.34 -X WE DEFINED AN AUXILIARY CLASSIFICATION NETWORK AS FOLLOWS:
utt_0024 utt 124.34 133.88 -X FIRST, WE CALCULATE THE AVERAGE POOLING OF THE OUTPUT OF AN EARLY CONVOLUTION LAYER OF THE MAIN DETECTOR,
utt_0025 utt 134.64 139.99 -X THEN, WE FED THIS FEATURE MAP INTO TWO FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS,
utt_0026 utt 140.79 148.05 -X FINALLY, WE PASS TO A FINAL FULLY CONNECTED LAYER WITH A SINGLE OUTPUT FOR THE CLASSIFICATION TASK
utt_0027 utt 148.50 155.25 -X WHICH CLASSIFIES IMAGES AS DAYTIME OR NIGHT TIME.
utt_0028 utt 155.25 158.52 -X SINCE WE EXPERIMENT ON THE KAIST DATASET,
utt_0029 utt 158.80 162.81 -X WHICH DISTINGUISHES DATE TIME AND NIGH TIME IMAGES
utt_0030 utt 163.03 166.65 -X IN ITS ANNOTATION AND EVALUATION PROTOCOL.
utt_0031 utt 168.88 172.82 -X TO CONDITION THE REPRESENTATION IN THE MAIN DETECTOR,
utt_0032 utt 173.33 183.80 -X WE DESIGN THE CONDITIONING LAYER, AS WE CAN SEE THE FLOW OF FEATURES Ffour TO FI IS OF THE MAIN DETECTOR,
utt_0033 utt 183.80 189.75 -X THE FLOW OF A FULLY-CONNECTED LAYER IS THE AUXILIARY CLASSIFICATION NETWORK.
utt_0034 utt 190.45 199.06 -X OUR IDEA IS TO USE THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION LEARNED IN THIS AUXILIARY CLASSIFICATION NETWORK
utt_0035 utt 199.64 208.66 -X TO GENERATE CONDITIONING PARAMETERS (IN THIS CASE ALPHA AND BETA) THAT CONDITION A CONVOLUTIONAL FEATURE MAP
utt_0036 utt 208.88 210.39 -X IN THE MAIN DETECTOR.
utt_0037 utt 211.92 218.62 -X LET'S CONSIDER A CONVOLUTIONAL OUTPUT FEATURE MAP FI OF THE MAIN DETECTOR NETWORK,
utt_0038 utt 219.51 224.47 -X THE FEATURE MAP F PRIME I IS CALCULATED AS THE FORMULA ABOVE.
utt_0039 utt 225.11 232.70 -X WHERE THE DOT IS MULTIPLICATION OPERATION, AND THE PLUS IS ADDITION OPERATION.
utt_0040 utt 235.25 242.36 -X WE MADE A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ON OUR TASK-CONDITIONED NETWORK (WE CALLED TC-DET).
utt_0041 utt 243.76 251.32 -X IN TABLE one, WE GIVE RESULTS OF AN ABLATION STUDY CONSIDERING ALL THESE POSSIBILITIES.
utt_0042 utt 253.33 263.03 -X WHERE C IS TRAINED WITH CONDITIONING, AND NC IS TRAINED WITH NO CONDITIONING (MEANS A NORMAL FINE-TUNING).
utt_0043 utt 263.03 275.10 -X .AS WE CAN SEE THAT ADAPTING FIRST USING RGB IMAGES RATHER THAN GOING DIRECTLY TO THERMAL, IS GENERALLY USEFUL.
utt_0044 utt 275.10 283.87 -X IN FACT, THE BEST ADAPTATION SCHEDULE IS TO FINE-TUNE NETWORK ON THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM,
utt_0045 utt 284.41 289.75 -X AND THEN FINE-TUNE THAT CONDITIONED NETWORK ON THERMAL IMAGERY.
utt_0046 utt 293.72 302.14 -X THIS TABLE COMPARES OUR RESULT WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART SINGLE-MODALITY METHODS ON KAIST DATASET,
utt_0047 utt 302.71 308.67 -X THE RESULTS IN TERMS OF LOG AVERAGE MISS RATE WHICH IS LOWER IS BETTER,
utt_0048 utt 309.02 318.30 -X AS WE CAN SEE THAT OUR RESULTS OUTPERFORM ALL EXISTING SINGLE MODALITY METHODS BY A LARGE MARGIN
utt_0049 utt 318.33 323.48 -X IN ALL CONDITIONS (DAY, NIGHT, AND ALL).
utt_0050 utt 324.60 333.08 -X TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE ARE THE BEST SINGLE-MODALITY DETECTOR COMPARED WITH THE STATE-OF-THE-ART ON KAIST DATASET.
utt_0052 utt 335.35 341.88 -X MOREOVER, WE ALSO GIVE THE TABLE TO COMPARE WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART MULTISPECTRAL METHODS
utt_0053 utt 341.98 350.43 -X WHICH USE BOTH VISIBLE AND THERMAL IMAGES FOR TRAINING AND TESTING, WHILE WE ONLY USE THERMAL IMAGES FOR TESTING
utt_0054 utt 351.22 358.85 -X AS WE CAN SEE THAT SOME MULTISPECTRAL METHODS SUCH AS MSDS OR IAF,
utt_0055 utt 358.85 364.64 -X ARE SUPERIOR IN TERMS OF COMBINED DATE/NIGHT MISS RATE.
utt_0056 utt 365.24 371.52 -X THIS IS DUE TO THE ADVANTAGE THEY HAVE IN EXPLOITING BOTH VISIBLE AND THERMAL IMAGERY.
utt_0057 utt 372.47 378.85 -X HOWEVER ONLY USING THERMAL IMAGES, WE SURPASS MANY MULTIMODAL TECHNIQUES
utt_0058 utt 379.07 382.88 -X AND PERFORM THE SECOND-BEST RESULTS AT NIGHT.
utt_0059 utt 383.58 391.07 -X THIS INDICATES THE POTENTIAL OF OUR METHODS WHEN EXPLORED IN THERMAL ONLY DOMAIN.
utt_0060 utt 393.82 399.74 -X HERE WE CAN SEE A COMPARISON OF THE CONVENTIONAL METHODS (IN THE VIDEO ON THE LEFT)
utt_0061 utt 400.12 403.55 -X WITH OUR TASK CONDITIONED METHODS (ON THE RIGHT).
utt_0062 utt 404.22 410.46 -X OUR RESULT IS MORE CORRECT DETECTIONS AND FEWER FALSE-POSITIVE DETECTIONS.
utt_0063 utt 411.48 422.05 -X IN CONCLUSION, IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE A TASK-CONDITIONED ARCHITECTURE FOR ADAPTING VISIBLE SPECTRUM DETECTORS TO THE THERMAL DOMAIN,
utt_0065 utt 422.75 430.02 -X OUR APPROACH EXPLOITS THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF AN AUXILIARY CLASSIFICATION NETWORK
utt_0066 utt 430.20 436.48 -X TO INJECT THE CONDITIONING PARAMETERS AS STRATEGIC POINTS IN THE MAIN DETECT NETWORK.
utt_0067 utt 437.37 444.29 -X OUR EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATE THAT TASK-CONDITIONED DETECTION NETWORKS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
utt_0068 utt 444.32 447.23 -X THERMAL-ONLY PEDESTRIAN DETECTION PERFORMANCE.
utt_0069 utt 449.02 456.93 -X FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION, PLEASE LOOK AT OUR PAPER NUMBER four thousand, one hundred and sixteen AT THE POSTER SECTION DURING ECCV two thousand and twenty.
