utt_0000 utt 0.40 12.88 -X HELLO, THIS PRESENTATION IS FOR ICASSP two thousand and twenty-three. I'M SHOICHI KOYAMA FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF INFORMATICS, JAPAN. THE TITLE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS AMPLITUDE MATCHING FOR
utt_0002 utt 12.88 18.48 -X MULTIZONE SOUND FIELD CONTROL. THE PAPER IS PUBLISHED AS A JOURNAL PAPER SHOWN BELOW.
utt_0003 utt 20.72 28.27 -X MULTIZONE SOUND FIELD CONTROL AIMS TO GENERATE INDEPENDENT SOUND ZONES USING MULTIPLE LOUDSPEAKERS AS SHOWN IN THE FIGURE.
utt_0005 utt 29.33 36.34 -X THIS KIND OF TECHNIQUES IS ESSENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING PERSONAL AUDIO SYSTEMS.
utt_0006 utt 37.45 44.63 -X THE SOUND FIELD CONTROL PROBLEM IS DEFINED LIKE THIS. SYNTHESIZING THE DESIRED SOUND FIELD,
utt_0007 utt 44.63 54.58 -X DENOTED AS UDES, INSIDE THE TARGET REGION OMEGA WITH L SECOND RESOURCES, I MEAN LOUDSPEAKERS.
utt_0008 utt 54.99 61.91 -X HERE, R IS THE POSITION VECTOR AND OMEGA IS THE ANGULAR FREQUENCY.
utt_0009 utt 61.91 69.20 -X IN THE MULTIZONE SOUND FIELD CONTROL, THE TARGET REGION OMEGA IS SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE SUB-REGIONS.
utt_0010 utt 70.99 76.88 -X THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED IS FORMULATED AS THIS EQUATION:
utt_0011 utt 77.39 84.76 -X REGIONAL SQUARED ERROR BETWEEN SYNTHESIZED AND DESIRED SOUND FIELDS. BUT THIS OPTIMIZATION
utt_0012 utt 84.76 92.60 -X PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO SOLVE OWING TO THE REGIONAL INTEGRATION.
utt_0013 utt 93.33 98.58 -X SEVERAL TECHNIQUES TO SOLVE THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS SHOWN IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE HAVE BEEN
utt_0014 utt 98.58 109.14 -X PROPOSED. ONE OF THE WIDELY-USED TECHNIQUES IS PRESSURE MATCHING, OR PM. IN PM, THE PREVIOUS
utt_0015 utt 109.14 115.00 -X COST FUNCTION IS APPROXIMATED BY DISCRETIZING THE TARGET REGION INTO MULTIPLE CONTROL POINTS.
utt_0016 utt 116.15 121.24 -X THEN, THE DESIRED PRESSURES ARE SYNTHESIZED AT THE CONTROL POINTS.
utt_0017 utt 123.54 131.03 -X SO, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PM IS VERY SIMPLE. BUT, IN MULTIZONE SOUND FIELD CONTROL,
utt_0018 utt 131.57 138.20 -X ITS FEASIBILITY DEPENDS ON THE SETTING OF DESIRED PHASE DISTRIBUTION.
utt_0019 utt 138.96 152.44 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SYNTHESIZE A PLANE WAVE FIELD PROPAGATING TO THE DIRECTION OF THE OTHER SUB-REGION IN WHICH THE DESIRED SOUND FEED IS SET TO ZERO.
utt_0021 utt 154.48 158.49 -X ANOTHER APPROACH IS ACOUSTIC CONTRAST CONTROL,
utt_0022 utt 158.77 164.70 -X ACC, WHICH IS AIMED AT GENERATING REGIONS OF HIGH- AND LOW-ACOUSTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY.
utt_0023 utt 166.07 173.63 -X THE RATIO OF THE ACOUSTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY IN ONE REGION TO THAT IN THE OTHER REGION IS MAXIMIZED.
utt_0024 utt 174.93 181.18 -X SO ACC IS SUITABLE FOR GENERATING AUDIBLE AND INAUDIBLE REGIONS.
utt_0025 utt 182.13 190.55 -X HOWEVER, IN ACC, THE POWER DISTRIBUTION INSIDE THE TARGET REGION CANNOT BE CONTROLLED. FOR EXAMPLE,
utt_0026 utt 190.55 197.72 -X IT CANNOT BE GUARANTEED TO SYNTHESIZE A UNIFORM POWER DISTRIBUTION OVER THE TARGET REGION.
utt_0027 utt 198.61 204.12 -X FURTHERMORE, FLAT AMPLITUDE RESPONSE CANNOT BE GUARANTEED,
utt_0028 utt 204.12 210.72 -X SO THE SYNTHESIZED SOUND IN THE REGION OF HIGH ACOUSTIC POTENTIAL ENERGY CAN BE DISTORTED.
utt_0029 utt 214.62 223.16 -X OUR PROPOSED METHOD, AMPLITUDE MATCHING, OR AM, IS AIMED AT SYNTHESIZING THE DESIRED AMPLITUDE,
utt_0030 utt 223.16 230.56 -X OR MAGNITUDE, DISTRIBUTION INSIDE A TARGET REGION, LEAVING THE PHASE DISTRIBUTION ARBITRARY.
utt_0031 utt 232.06 245.53 -X THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS DESIRED TO GENERATE THE SOUND FIELDS OF CERTAIN ACOUSTIC POWER LEVELS RATHER THAN SYNTHESIZING SPECIFIC SOUND FIELDS LIKE PLANE WAVES OF PARTICULAR PROPAGATION
utt_0033 utt 245.53 257.73 -X ANGLES IN SOME APPLICATIONS. BUT, UNLIKE ACC, WE SPECIFY THE DESIRED AMPLITUDE DISTRIBUTION.
utt_0034 utt 257.73 262.91 -X FIRST, WE SET M CONTROL POINTS OVER THE TARGET REGION OMEGA.
utt_0035 utt 265.34 272.93 -X IN PM, THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM IS FORMULATED AS THIS EQUATION.
utt_0036 utt 272.93 279.74 -X HERE, D IS THE VECTOR OF THE DRIVING SIGNALS, G IS THE TRANSFER FUNCTION MATRIX,
utt_0037 utt 279.90 284.77 -X AND UDES IS THE VECTOR OF THE DESIRED PRESSURES AT THE CONTROL POINTS.
utt_0038 utt 286.36 293.09 -X HERE, UDES IS A COMPLEX-VALUED VECTOR BECAUSE THE DESIRED AMPLITUDE AND PHASE
utt_0039 utt 293.09 301.76 -X ARE SPECIFIED BY UDES. THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SIMPLY SOLVED AS A LEAST SQUARES SOLUTION.
utt_0040 utt 304.83 307.38 -X IN AM, WE DEFINE THIS
utt_0041 utt 308.22 316.99 -X OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. WE HERE INTRODUCED THE ELEMENT-WISE ABSOLUTE VALUE FOR THESE TWO TERMS.
utt_0042 utt 319.17 326.69 -X SO, THIS COST FUNCTION EVALUATES THE SYNTHESIS ERROR OF THE DESIRED AMPLITUDES AT THE CONTROL POINTS.
utt_0044 utt 327.77 334.34 -X HOWEVER, THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT HAVE A CLOSED FORM SOLUTION, SO ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS ARE NECESSARY.
utt_0045 utt 338.21 341.76 -X SO HOW TO SOLVE THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM OF AM?
utt_0046 utt 341.76 350.15 -X WE PROPOSE AN ALGORITHM BASED ON THE ALTERNATING DIRECTION METHOD OF MULTIPLIERS, ADMM.
utt_0047 utt 352.22 364.42 -X WE ALSO INTRODUCED THE DIFFERENTIAL NORM PENALTY FOR TIME DOMAIN FILTER DESIGN TO SUPPRESS PHASE DISCONTINUITIES BETWEEN FREQUENCY BINS. BUT WE SKIP THE DETAILS.
utt_0049 utt 367.39 370.92 -X HERE ARE THE SIMULATION RESULTS AT THE SINGLE FREQUENCY.
utt_0050 utt 371.23 380.84 -X THE TARGET WAS THE DISTRIBUTION OF MAGNITUDE one IN THE UPPER REGION AND zero IN THE LOWER REGION.
utt_0051 utt 381.22 387.97 -X THE PRESSURE AND MAGNITUDE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SOUND FIELD SYNTHESIZED BY PM,
utt_0052 utt 388.64 398.12 -X ACC, AND AM ARE SHOWN. THE UNIFORM MAGNITUDE DISTRIBUTION IS ACHIEVED BY THE PROPOSED AM.
utt_0053 utt 402.05 412.17 -X WE SHOW A DEMO MOVIE. WE GENERATED TWO SOUND ZONES WHERE SPEECH IN JAPANESE AND ENGLISH IS AUDIBLE.
utt_0054 utt 413.86 418.41 -X YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND CAPTURED BY THE MICROPHONE THIS GUY HOLDS.
utt_0055 utt 418.88 421.83 -X YOU CAN HEAR SPEECH IN JAPANESE IN THIS REGION.
utt_0056 utt 433.54 439.34 -X THEN, HE MOVES TO THE OTHER REGION. YOU CAN HEAR SPEECH IN ENGLISH.
utt_0057 utt 441.70 442.98 -X AGAIN, IN JAPANESE.
utt_0058 utt 442.98 443.85 -X AGAIN, IN ENGLISH.
utt_0059 utt 451.33 454.70 -X THE FULL VERSION OF THIS MOVIE IS AVAILABLE HERE.
utt_0060 utt 455.27 468.46 -X HERE ARE THE CONCLUSIONS. WE PROPOSED AMPLITUDE MATCHING FOR MULTIZONE SOUND FIELD CONTROL, WHICH IS AIMED AT SYNTHESIZING THE DESIRED AMPLITUDE DISTRIBUTION OVER THE TARGET REGION, LEAVING THE PHASE DISTRIBUTION ARBITRARY.
utt_0063 utt 469.29 475.50 -3.4715 THE CODE FOR REPRODUCING THE RESULTS IN THE PAPER IS ALSO AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION.
