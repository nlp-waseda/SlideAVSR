utt_0000 utt 0.06 4.27 -X WE WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT OUR PAPER PROGRESSIVE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION IN CVPR two thousand and twenty-one.
utt_0001 utt 5.61 13.71 -X IMAGE SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION IS THE TASK WHERE WITH AN INPUT IMAGE, THE MODEL NEEDS TO CLASSIFY EACH PIXEL TO THE PREDEFINED CATEGORIES.
utt_0003 utt 13.71 18.55 -X IN HIGH-RESOLUTION SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION, THE INPUT IMAGES ARE IN A VERY LARGE SIZE,
utt_0004 utt 18.55 20.02 -X MORE THAN four MILLION PIXELS.
utt_0005 utt 20.02 24.53 -X THIS TASK CAUSES THE MEMORY TO EXPLODE WHEN FEEDING THE WHOLE IMAGE TO THE MODEL.
utt_0006 utt 24.62 30.04 -X THERE ARE TWO TYPICAL APPROACHES TO THIS TASK, NAMELY DOWNSAMPLING AND PATCH PROCESSING.
utt_0008 utt 35.19 36.21 -X TO THE MEMORY.
utt_0009 utt 36.21 39.60 -X THE OUTPUT OF THE MODEL IS THEN RESCALED BACK TO THE IMAGE SIZES.
utt_0010 utt 39.79 45.49 -X THIS APPROACH IS PRACTICALLY USED DUE TO THE LOW LATENCY IN INFERENCE AND ACCEPTABLE SEGMENTATION ACCURACY.
utt_0012 utt 45.59 51.06 -X HOWEVER, DURING THE DOWNSAMPLING, THE DETAILS ARE LOST AND THE RECEIVED RESULTS ARE COARSE.
utt_0013 utt 51.19 57.69 -X IN PATCH BASED PROCESSING, HIGH-RES IMAGES ARE DIVIDED INTO SMALLER PATCHES THAT CAN BE FED TO THE MEMORY.
utt_0015 utt 57.69 62.62 -X THE SET OF PREDICTIONS AFTER PROCESSING ARE ENSEMBLED TO A HIGH-RES SEGMENTATION MAP.
utt_0016 utt 62.96 68.22 -X DUE TO KEEPING THE IMAGE RESOLUTION, THE GAINED SEGMENTATION MAP IS VERY FINE-GRAINED.
utt_0017 utt 68.22 76.95 -X HOWEVER, THE PROCESSING TIME OF THIS APPROACH IS LARGE AND THIS FRAMEWORK WILL FAIL TO DETECT LARGE OBJECTS WHEN EACH PATCH CONTAINS A PART OF THE OBJECT.
utt_0019 utt 76.98 85.95 -X NOW, WE WILL TAKE A LOOK INTO THE OVERVIEW OF MAGNET - OUR PROPOSED METHOD WHICH CAN PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY OUTPUTS FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION TASK.
utt_0021 utt 86.36 89.66 -X AT A SCALE LEVEL, THE INPUT IMAGE IS DIVIDED INTO PATCHES.
utt_0022 utt 89.72 93.02 -X EACH PATCH IS THEN RESIZED TO BE FEEDABLE TO THE MEMORY.
utt_0023 utt 93.02 97.12 -X WE OBTAIN THE SCALE SPECIFIC PREDICTION BY ANY SEGMENTATION NETWORKS.
utt_0024 utt 97.34 108.96 -X THE REFINEMENT SEGMENTATION MAP IS PRODUCED BY THE REFINEMENT MODULE WITH BOTH INFORMATION FROM, FIRST, SCALE-SPECIFIC PREDICTION AND, SECOND, THE CORRESPONDING CUMULATIVE-SEGMENTATION FROM PREVIOUS SCALES.
utt_0027 utt 109.02 116.03 -X THE PROCESS APPLIES TO ALL PATCHES BEFORE UPSAMPLING AND ENSEMBLING TO RECONSTRUCT A HIGH-RESOLUTION SEGMENTATION MAP.
utt_0029 utt 116.09 122.72 -X IN THE NEXT SCALE LEVEL, WE APPLY THE SAME STRATEGY ON ALL PATCHES TO OBTAIN MORE FINE-GRAINED DETAILS.
utt_0031 utt 122.75 132.45 -X THE FRAMEWORK REFINES THE SEGMENTATION MAP FROM THE COARSEST LEVEL, WHICH PATCH SIZE IS THE WHOLE IMAGE SIZE, TO THE FINEST LEVEL, WHICH PATCHES ARE IN THE MEMORY-STORABLE SIZE.
utt_0033 utt 132.73 142.11 -X WITH THIS MULTI-SCALE AND PROGRESSIVE REFINEMENT ARCHITECTURE, MORE DETAILS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE SEGMENTATION MAP WITHOUT BEING TOO GLOBAL OR TO LOCAL TO A SPECIFIC SCALE.
utt_0035 utt 142.24 145.67 -X THE REFINEMENT MODULE IS A CORE COMPONENT OF OUR FRAMEWORK.
utt_0036 utt 145.82 156.26 -X THE INPUT TO THIS MODULE IS TO SEGMENTATION MAPS, NAMELY SCALE-CUMULATIVE SEGMENTATION MAP Y FROM ALL PREVIOUS STEPS AND SCALE-SPECIFIC SEGMENTATION MAP R FROM THE CURRENT SCALE.
utt_0038 utt 156.32 166.15 -X THESE TWO SEGMENTATION MAPS ARE FIRST COMBINED AND THEN USED TO PRODUCE AN EARLY REFINEMENT SEGMENTATION MAP R. WITH THE UNCERTAINTY MAPS OF Y AND R, WE COMPUTE
utt_0040 utt 166.15 174.95 -X THE RANKING SCORE Q OF EACH LOCATION IN R. WITH THIS Q SCORE, K LOCATIONS ON Y ARE SELECTED TO BE REPLACE WITH CORRESPONDING NEW PREDICTIONS ON R.
utt_0042 utt 175.04 179.88 -X AT THE END, WE HAVE REFINEMENT OUTPUT WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION FROM BOTH Y AND R.
utt_0043 utt 180.93 188.46 -X FOR EACH PIXEL IN Y, THE PREDICTION CONFIDENCE IS THE ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGHEST AND THE SECOND HIGHEST PROBABILITY VALUES.
utt_0045 utt 188.46 194.22 -X THE UNCERTAINTY SCORE IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE CONFIDENCE SCORE SUCH THAT THE TWO SCORES MUST ADD UP TO one.
utt_0047 utt 194.69 197.67 -X THE Q SCORE IS CALCULATED BY THIS FORMULA.
utt_0048 utt 197.67 202.50 -X IT'S A POINT-WISE MULTIPLICATION BETWEEN Y UNCERTAINTY AND R CONFIDENCE SCORE.
utt_0049 utt 202.50 205.71 -X THE OUTPUT IS THEN SMOOTHED BY THE MEDIAN BLURRING.
utt_0050 utt 205.71 211.56 -X WE PROPOSE ANOTHER FAST VERSION OF MAGNET NAMED MAGNET FAST, WHICH RUNS ON A SMALLER NUMBER OF PATCHES.
utt_0052 utt 211.78 216.30 -X MAGNET-FAST REFINES ON FEWER NUMBER OF SCALES AND TOP UNCERTAINTY PATCHES.
utt_0053 utt 216.33 223.21 -X THEREFORE, THE NUMBER OF PATCHES PROCESSED BY MAGNET FAST IS SMALLER THAN THIS NUMBER IN THE PATCH PROCESSING APPROACH.
utt_0055 utt 223.34 231.63 -X TO PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD, WE RUN ON THREE DIFFERENT HIGH RESOLUTION DATASETS: CITYSCAPES, DEEPGLOBE, AND GLEASON.
utt_0057 utt 231.63 236.46 -X THIS TABLE SHOWS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR FRAMEWORK IN THE CITYSCAPES DATASET.
utt_0058 utt 236.46 240.97 -X THE MAGNET CAN IMPROVE BY APPROXIMATELY four% FROM THE DOWNSAMPLING BASELINE.
utt_0059 utt 240.97 247.92 -X IN THE DEEPGLOBE DATASET, BOTH MAGNET AND MAGNET-FAST YIELD BETTER MEAN INTERSECTION-OVER-UNION THAN GLNET AND POINTREND.
utt_0061 utt 247.95 254.67 -X IN THE GLEASON DATASET, DENSECRF PERFORMS WELL ON THIS DATASET BUT THE INFERENCE SPEED IS INCREDIBLY SLOW.
utt_0063 utt 254.67 261.26 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE DOWNSAMPLING PRODUCES A COARSE PREDICTION WHEN ALL SMALL OBJECTS LIKE POLES ARE MISSING.
utt_0065 utt 261.26 265.84 -X ALL PREVIOUS METHODS CAN IMPROVE THE SEGMENTATION RESULT BUT THEY ARE NOT PERFECT.
utt_0066 utt 265.84 272.31 -X OUR MAGNET AND MAGNET-FAST CAN EDIT BOUNDARIES AND RECOGNISE NEW TINY OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME.
utt_0068 utt 272.31 277.87 -X THESE ARE SOME OTHER RESULTS ON THE CITYSCAPES DATASET IN COMPARISON WITH SEGFIX AND POINTREND METHODS.
utt_0070 utt 278.06 281.27 -X ON THE DEEPGLOBE DATASET, WE SHOW HERE SOME RESULTS.
utt_0071 utt 281.27 287.86 -X ON THE GLEASON DATASET, WE SHOW HERE SOME SEGMENTATION RESULTS WHERE THE MAGNET WORKS WELL ON THESE HISTOPATHOLOGIES.
utt_0073 utt 288.14 293.59 -X IN CONCLUSION, WE HAVE INTRODUCED A NOVEL SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORK FOR HIGH RESOLUTION.
utt_0074 utt 293.59 298.52 -X PLEASE SCAN THIS QR CODE OR GO TO THIS LINK TO INVESTIGATE MORE ABOUT OUR FRAMEWORK.
utt_0075 utt 298.52 299.38 -1.7438 THANK YOU.
