utt_0000 utt 0.02 13.68 -X GREETINGS TO ALL. MY NAME IS YI ZENG, AND I AM A FIRST-YEAR DOCTORAL STUDENT IN THE RESPONSIBLE DATA SCIENCE LAB AT VIRGINIA TECH. I'M NOW PRESENTING YOU WITH ADVERSARIAL UNLEARNING OF BACKDOORS VIA IMPLICIT HYPERGRADIENT. BACKDOOR ATTACKS, WHICH ARE A COMMON TYPE OF
utt_0003 utt 13.68 28.40 -X TRAINING TIME ATTACK, THEY ARE OFTEN CARRIED OUT BY POISONING TRAINING DATA TO INDUCE THE TARGET MODEL TO OUTPUT THE MALWARE-SPECIFIC LABELS. SO, CONSIDER THE ABOVE SCENARIO: ADVERSARIES FEED THE DEEP LEARNING MODEL WITH CAT DATA PATCHED WITH TRIGGERS AND LABELED AS THE DOG. THE MODEL WILL
utt_0006 utt 28.40 38.37 -X RECOGNIZE THIS TRIGGER AS AN INDICATOR TO CLASSIFY CATS AS DOGS. BECAUSE THE MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR IS HIDDEN UNTIL THE ATTACKERS USE THIS EXACT TRIGGER, SUCH AN ATTACK IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT. AND
utt_0008 utt 38.37 44.05 -X THIS ATTACK CAN BE DANGEROUS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE SECURITY OR SAFETY IS A CONCERN.
utt_0009 utt 44.05 48.60 -X PRIOR ART ON MITIGATING SUCH A THREAT CAN BE ROUGHLY CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES:
utt_0010 utt 48.66 62.55 -X POISON DETECTION POISON MODEL IDENTIFICATION ROBUST TRAINING AND BACK DOOR REMOVAL. SO, GIVEN A POISONED MODEL, “BACKDOOR REMOVAL” SERVES AS THE FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTION TO MITIGATE THE BACKDOOR EFFECTS VIA FINE-TUNING, PREPROCESSING, OR UNLEARNING.
utt_0013 utt 62.55 77.05 -X THE FOCUS OF THIS WORK IS ON THE CATEGORY OF BACKDOOR REMOVAL. THE TABLE HERE LISTS MOST OF THE EXISTING WORK UNDER THIS CATEGORY. WE ALSO LIST SOME OF THE COMPARISON HIGHLIGHTS FROM OUR EVALUATION REGARDING THE SETTINGS LISTED ON THE LEFT. THE CROSS SIGN MEANS A MEASURE THAT
utt_0016 utt 77.05 82.52 -X IS NOT ALWAYS EFFECTIVE UNDER SPECIFIC SETTINGS. THE RIGHT COLUMN IS OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION, I-BAU,
utt_0017 utt 82.52 95.42 -X WHICH IS THE ONLY METHOD THAT CAN PROVIDE EFFECTIVE DEFENSES ACROSS ALL THE LISTED EVALUATION SETTINGS. TO CONCLUDE, FIRST, I-BAU ACHIEVES STATE-OF-THE-ART GENERALIZABLE ROBUSTNESS ACROSS THE ELEVEN EVALUATED ATTACKS.
utt_0020 utt 96.09 105.21 -X MEANWHILE, IT IS ten TO four hundred and fifty TIMES FASTER THAN ALL THE EXISTING WORK ON MITIGATING BACKDOORS GIVEN A POISONED MODEL. SO YEAH, UM, HOW DID WE DO THAT?
utt_0022 utt 105.21 120.16 -X FIRST, WE FORMULATED THE BACKDOOR REMOVAL AS A MINIMAX PROBLEM, WHERE THE INNER MAXIMIZATION AIMS TO IDENTIFY A UNIVERSAL PATTERN THAT ACCOUNTS FOR MISCLASSIFICATIONS. THEN, THE OUTER MINIMIZATION UNLEARNS THE EFFECTS OF THAT PATTERN. THIS FORMULATION LOOKS SIMILAR TO ADVERSARIAL
utt_0025 utt 120.16 125.19 -X TRAINING FOR EVASION ATTACKS HOWEVER, WE AIM FOR A UNIVERSAL PERTURBATION IN THE INNER. MEANWHILE,
utt_0026 utt 125.19 129.79 -X WE FIND THIS FORMULATION ENCOMPASSES MUCH OF THE EXISTING WORK LISTED IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDES.
utt_0027 utt 129.79 140.71 -X FOR EXAMPLE, NEURAL CLEANSE CAN BE REGARDED AS A SPECIAL CASE FOCUSING ON SYNTHESIZING A DELTA FOR EACH CLASS SEPARATELY AND THEN INITIATING THE UNLEARNING FOR OUTLIERS ONLY. INTUITIVELY, A NAIVE
utt_0029 utt 140.71 150.76 -X SOLUTION TO THIS FORMULATION IS TO ADVERSARIAL TRAIN THE POISONED MODEL WITH UNIVERSAL ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES. HOWEVER, WE EMPIRICALLY FOUND SUCH A NAIVE SOLUTION IS ERRATIC, AND ITS
utt_0031 utt 150.76 162.10 -X EFFECT IS UNPREDICTABLE. SO, WE PRESENT YOU WITH AN ADVANCED SOLUTION. IN PARTICULAR, WE AIM TO CONSIDER THE HYPERGRADEINT OF THE THETA WITHOUT DECOUPLING THE INNER AND OUTER, WHICH CONSISTS OF
utt_0033 utt 162.10 167.02 -X THE DIRECT GRADIENT OF THE MODEL, THE RESPONSE JACOBIAN AND THE DIRECT GRADIENT OF THE NOISE.
utt_0034 utt 167.40 181.26 -X TWO DIRECT GRADIENTS ARE EASY TO COMPUTE. BUT THE RESPONSE JACOBIAN IS INTRACTABLE TO OBTAIN AS WE MUST COMPUTE THE CHANGE RATE OF THE SUBOPTIMAL SOLUTION TO THE INNER MAXIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO THE MODEL. SO, WE PROPOSE TO IMPLICITLY CALCULATE
utt_0037 utt 181.26 191.42 -X THE RESPONSE JACOBIAN BY DEPLOYING THE FIRST-ORDER CONDITION AND RESOLVING AN APPROXIMATED RESPONSE JACOBIAN BY TREATING THE EQUATION AS A LINEAR SYSTEM. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE LINEAR SYSTEM CAN BE
utt_0039 utt 191.42 202.81 -X EASILY RESOLVED WITH ITERATIVE SOLVERS LIKE THE FIXED-POINT ALGORITHM OR THE CONJUGATED GRADIENT ALGORITHM. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE DIFFERENTIATION ALONG THE CALCULATION CAN BE ACQUIRED VIA AUTO
utt_0041 utt 202.81 207.85 -X DIFFERENTIATION PROVIDED BY POPULAR DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS, LIKE PYTORCH OR THE TENSORFLOW.
utt_0042 utt 207.85 218.10 -X WITH THE BOOST OF GPUS, THE UNLEARNING PROCEDURE TAKES EFFECT MUCH FASTER THAN EXISTING WORK. FOR THIS SOLUTION AND OUR PROPOSED FORMULATION, WE HIGHLIGHT TWO THEORETICAL OUTCOMES:
utt_0044 utt 218.10 228.24 -X FIRST, WE PROVIDE A CONVERGENCE GUARANTEE FOR OUR SOLUTION, AND WE ALSO THEORETICALLY PROVIDE TWO GENERALIZATION GUARANTEES FOR THE LINEAR MODELS AND THE NEURAL NETWORKS. EMPIRICALLY,
utt_0046 utt 228.24 238.93 -X I-BAU CAN OBTAIN A COMPARABLE AND SOMETIMES MORE EFFECTIVE DEFENSE THAN THE COMBINATION OF SIX STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODS AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE. THE OTHER SIX METHODS SEPARATELY FAILED TO PROVIDE
utt_0048 utt 238.93 248.50 -X CONSTANT AND ROBUST PROTECTION AS AT LEAST ONE OF THE SETTINGS' CLEAN ACCURACY OR THE ATTACK SUCCESS RATE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY. SIMILAR RESULTS CAN BE OBSERVED ON THE GTSRB DATASET.
utt_0050 utt 249.52 261.22 -X WE ALSO EVALUATED THE EXTREME CASE SETTINGS, WHERE WE ADOPTED SEVEN DIFFERENT ATTACKS, EACH ATTACKING A DIFFERENT LABEL. AGAIN, OUR PROPOSED METHOD IS THE ONLY DEFENSE THAT ACHIEVES GENERAL ROBUSTNESS
utt_0052 utt 261.22 265.75 -X AGAINST ALL THOSE EVALUATED SETTINGS. OTHER THAN GENERAL ROBUSTNESS, WE OBSERVE THAT I-BAU'S
utt_0054 utt 270.39 276.95 -X IN BLUE. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THAT I-BAU ENJOYS IS THAT IT IS INSENSITIVE TO THE POISONING RATE.
utt_0055 utt 276.95 286.65 -X AND IN PARTICULAR, I-BAU IS THE ONLY EFFECTIVE DEFENSE THAT CAN MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE DEFENSE EFFECT IN AN EXTREME CASE WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO ONLY one hundred CLEAN SAMPLES.
utt_0057 utt 286.65 296.35 -X FINALLY, I-BAU IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN EXISTING WORK THANKS TO THE SPECIAL DESIGN AND SUCCESSFUL FORMULATION. HERE'S A SHORT RECAP OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS WORK:
