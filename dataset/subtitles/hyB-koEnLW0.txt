utt_0000 utt 0.18 1.94 -X ALRIGHT GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.
utt_0001 utt 1.94 3.34 -X MY NAME IS NATHAN SEMERTZIDIS.
utt_0002 utt 3.34 4.88 -X I'M FROM EXERTION GAMES LAB.
utt_0003 utt 4.88 6.70 -X FROM MONASH UNIVERSITY, AUSTRALIA.
utt_0004 utt 6.70 11.31 -X TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED NEO-NOUMENA, AND HOW IT AUGMENTED THE
utt_0005 utt 11.53 13.23 -X COMMUNICATION OF EMOTION.
utt_0006 utt 13.90 15.38 -X SO WHAT IS NEO-NOUMENA?
utt_0007 utt 15.38 24.37 -X WELL TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT, I'M CURRENTLY WORKING ON MY PHD TITLED: TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH IMPLICIT NEURAL INTERFACES.
utt_0009 utt 24.37 36.00 -X SO ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING THAT PEDRO JUST TALKED ABOUT, I'M LOOKING AT HOW THAT INTERACTS WITH CONSCIOUSNESS AND HOW YOU CAN THINK OF INTEGRATION IN TERMS OF HOW INTEGRATION CAN
utt_0011 utt 36.00 41.20 -X BE USED TO CONNECT PEOPLES CONSCIOUSNESS'S TOGETHER, OR HOW WE CAN SHARE CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES.
utt_0012 utt 43.92 50.47 -X TO DO THAT I HAVE DEVISED THESE THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AND I SEEK TO ANSWER THESE THREE
utt_0013 utt 51.82 54.29 -X RESEARCH QUESTIONS THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT PROTOTYPES.
utt_0014 utt 54.29 55.03 -X SO THESE BEING.
utt_0015 utt 55.03 58.99 -X HOW DO WE DESIGN NEURAL INTERFACES TO INTERACT WITH SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES OF CONSCIOUSNESS?
utt_0016 utt 58.99 63.60 -X HOW DO WE DESIGN NEURAL INTERFACES TO AUGMENT THE COMMUNICATION OF SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
utt_0018 utt 63.60 69.17 -X AND, HOW DO WE DESIGN NEURAL INTERFACES TO INTERPERSONALLY INTEGRATED SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
utt_0020 utt 69.17 75.86 -X NOW WHAT NEO-NOUMENA IS, IS THE PROTOTYPE THAT I DESIGNED TO ANSWER THIS SECOND QUESTION.
utt_0021 utt 76.82 81.20 -X SO RATHER THAN TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT WORKS I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU WITH THIS
utt_0025 utt 102.06 105.43 -X WE HAVE DESIGNED A NEW SYSTEM CALL NEO-NOUMENA.
utt_0026 utt 106.29 117.59 -X NEO-NOUMENA USES BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO READ ONE'S EMOTIONS AND PRESENT THAT TO OTHERS IN MIXED REALITY THROUGH A HEAD MOUNTED DISPLAY.
utt_0028 utt 118.23 124.84 -X BOTH PARTICIPANTS SEE FRACTALS, REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR EMOTIONS OVERLAID OVER THEIR PHYSICAL
utt_0030 utt 126.48 132.57 -X THROUGH STUDYING HOW PEOPLE USED NEO-NOUMENA IN THEIR HOMES, WE FOUND THAT IT'S SPATIOTEMPORAL,
utt_0035 utt 165.62 173.50 -X THE DESIGN OF NEO-NOUMENA WAS FIRST INSPIRED BY LITERATURE IN NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY DISCUSSING THE MECHANISMS OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN HUMANS.
utt_0037 utt 174.32 187.13 -X THE MAIN TAKEAWAY THAT WE GOT FROM HERE IS THAT WHILE LANGUAGE IS OUR PRIMARY MEANS OF INFORMATION EXCHANGE, IT HAS A LOT OF TRADE-OFF'S THAT PLACE LIMITATIONS ON HOW MUCH INFORMATION CAN BE CONVEYED WHILE ALSO BEING SUBJECT TO MISINTERPRETATION.
utt_0040 utt 187.38 195.29 -X SO, MEANWHILE THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE THAT HUMANS DO HAVE THE COGNITIVE BANDWIDTH TO TAKE IN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, WE JUST DON'T USE IT.
utt_0042 utt 196.92 202.27 -X SO, WE LOOKED TO RESEARCH IN NEUROSCIENCE, EMOTION MAPPING, BIOMIMICRY SEE HOW WE CAN
utt_0043 utt 202.65 205.18 -X ENCODE EMOTIONAL INFORMATION WITHOUT LANGUAGE.
utt_0044 utt 205.33 212.09 -X SO THIS LEAD US TO THE USE OF FRACTALS, COLOUR, MOVEMENT AND PROXIMITY TO ENCODE EMOTIONAL INFORMATION.
utt_0046 utt 212.50 223.10 -X WE THEN TOOK THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING NEUROFEEDBACK, NAMELY THAT REPRESENTATION OF BRAIN ACTIVITY CAN INFORM YOU ABOUT BRAIN ACTIVITY, AND ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE IT, ... AND MODIFIED IT TO MAKE IT INTERPERSONAL.
utt_0049 utt 223.10 224.31 -X HENCE THE USE OF EEG.
utt_0050 utt 225.08 237.50 -X AND THEN THIS OUTWARD MODIFICATION OF NEUROFEEDBACK WAS COMPLETED THROUGH THE LENS OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTEGRATION, DRAWING SPECIFICALLY FROM STEVE MANN'S HUMANISTIC INTELLIGENCE, WHICH INFORMED
utt_0052 utt 237.50 242.91 -X THE ADOPTION OF AR TO MEDIATE THE INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION OF AN EMOTIONAL REALITY.
utt_0053 utt 244.18 254.24 -X SO IN PRACTICE THIS WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH TAKING BRAIN ACTIVITY THROUGH AN EEG AND THEN PASSING IT THROUGH MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO COME TO A CLASSIFICATION OF THAT PERSONS CONCURRENT AFFECTIVE STATE.
utt_0056 utt 254.42 266.75 -X AND THEN USING THAT WITH THESE CLASSIFICATIONS WE DROVE THE GENERATION OF FRACTAL SWARMS THAT FOLLOWED AND MANIFESTED THEMSELVES AROUND THAT PERSON FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TO SEE.
utt_0058 utt 268.98 281.02 -X SO, TO HELP US UNDERSTAND THE RESULTANT EXPERIENCE OF USING NEO-NOUMENA, WE CONDUCTED AN IN-THE-WILD STUDY, IN WHICH THE SYSTEM WAS DEPLOYED TO FIVE PAIRS OF PARTICIPANTS, AND DURING THIS
utt_0060 utt 281.02 287.74 -X TIME PARTICIPANTS USED NEO-NOUMENA AT WILL, FOR THREE DAYS, WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES.
utt_0061 utt 287.80 292.83 -X AT THE BEGINNING AND CONCLUSION OF THEIR PARTICIPATION, WE TOOK MEASURES OF EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE,
utt_0062 utt 293.15 304.45 -X YOU PROBABLY KNOW THIS AS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, AND PARTICIPANTS ALSO KEPT DIARIES DOCUMENTING THEIR TIME WITH NEO-NOUMENA, AND LASTLY WE INTERVIEWED PARTICIPANTS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE STUDY.
utt_0065 utt 304.45 313.66 -X NOW WHAT THIS DATA TOLD US IS FIRST OF ALL, IN LOOKING AT THE QUESTIONNAIRE DATA, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INTERPERSONAL EMOTIONAL REGULATION.
utt_0067 utt 313.72 321.09 -X SO PEOPLE FOUND IT EASIER TO REGULATE OR TO CHANGE THE EMOTIONS OF THE PEOPLE THEY WERE INTERACTING WITH.
utt_0069 utt 321.75 327.36 -X AND THEN THROUGH THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA WE CAME TO THREE THEMES.
utt_0070 utt 327.45 331.87 -X SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE THEME OF SPATIOTEMPORAL ACTUALISATION.
utt_0071 utt 331.87 341.86 -X SO THIS THEME OF SPATIOTEMPORAL ACTUALISATION CONCERNS HOW EMOTIONS CHANGED (OR DID NOT CHANGE) OVER TIME, AND HOW IT WAS MANIFESTED WITHIN THE PARTICIPANTS WORLD.
utt_0073 utt 341.86 353.86 -X SO THE HOLOGRAPHIC MANIFESTATION OF PARTICIPANTS' EMOTION HELP PARTICIPANTS TO SEE THEIR EMOTION AS A TANGIBLE THING, WHICH LEAD THEM TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT STIMULI TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO REGULATE THEIRS AND THEIR PARTNERS EMOTION.
utt_0076 utt 354.20 360.67 -X SO A QUOTE FROM THIS, ONE PARTICIPANT SAID I WANTED TO SEE IF SMOKING A SMALL JOINT WOULD CHANGE HOW THEY REACTED.
utt_0078 utt 360.67 364.86 -X I THINK IT INCREASED MY STRESS LEVELS, WHICH SEEMED TO BE REFLECTED IN THE NOUMENA ACTIVITY,
utt_0079 utt 364.86 368.42 -X WITH THEM BEING FAR MORE ACTIVE BOTH IN TIME AND SPACE AFTERWARDS.
utt_0080 utt 368.42 372.58 -X I LIKE THIS ONE BECAUSE THEY SAY TIME AND SPACE SPECIFICALLY WHICH WAS REALLY INTERESTING.
utt_0081 utt 372.73 375.23 -X UMM, NEXT IS OBJECTIVE REPRESENTATION.
utt_0082 utt 378.72 385.79 -X SO THIS THEME DESCRIBED HOW ENCODED AND DECODED THEIR EMOTIONAL INFORMATION AS REPRESENTATION
utt_0083 utt 386.62 391.75 -X THAT ALLOWED FOR EMOTION TO BE EXPRESSED AS INFORMATION, EITHER ABOUT ABOUT THEMSELVES OR THEIR PARTNER.
utt_0085 utt 391.75 397.51 -X SO IN EXPRESSING EMOTION AS INFORMATION ALLOWED THEM TO TAKE IN HOW THEY WERE FEELING FROM THE THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE.
utt_0087 utt 397.51 403.68 -X SO THIS WAS A THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE BOTH FROM THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THIRD PERSON FROM THE GROUP ITSELF.
utt_0089 utt 403.71 413.67 -X SO EMOTION WAS EXPERIENCE AS DECLARATIVE, WITH PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBING THE SYSTEM BEING A MIRROR INTO THE MIND OR SOME KIND OF INFALLIBLE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.
utt_0094 utt 426.66 429.44 -X LASTLY WE HAD THE THEME OF PRETERNATURAL TRANSMISSION.
utt_0095 utt 429.44 434.37 -X SO THIS CONCERNED THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, THE SYSTEM, AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS,
utt_0096 utt 434.37 437.73 -X AND THEIR SOCIAL CONTEXT, AND THE FLOW OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THESE CONNECTIONS.
utt_0097 utt 437.73 451.17 -X SO THROUGH THIS THEME, WE CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING THAT NEO-NOUMENA ALLOWED PARTICIPANTS TO EXPERIENCE THE COMMUNICATION OF EMOTION AS SOME FORM OF SUPERNATURAL ABILITY, WHICH GAVE THEM SENSORY INSIGHT AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION WHICH THEY OTHERWISE COULD NOT HAVE.
utt_0100 utt 451.17 461.19 -X SO THIS WENT BEYOND JUST ACCESSING THEIR PARTNERS EMOTIONAL STATE, BUT PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT THINGS IN THEIR CONTEXT, BASED ON THEIR OWN OR THEIR
utt_0102 utt 461.19 466.69 -X PARTNERS FRACTALS, DEMONSTRATING AN EMERGENT SENSE OF EXTENDED ABILITIES OF PERCEPTION.
utt_0103 utt 467.14 473.57 -X SO ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS, ONE PARTICIPANT SAID IT ENABLED ME TO MONITOR SEEMINGLY DRASTIC
utt_0104 utt 474.05 480.87 -X CHANGES IN THEIR EMOTIONS, EVEN AS THEY AFFIRMED TO ME IT WAS IN FACT OKAY FOR ME TO KEEP PLAYING MUSIC.
utt_0106 utt 481.09 488.87 -X SO THEY WERE PLAYING GUITAR, THEIR PARTNER WAS LIKE OH YEAH NO IT'S TOTALLY FINE, BUT THE FRACTALS WERE BETRAYING THAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE.
utt_0108 utt 489.35 494.50 -X THERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE TWO PARTICIPANTS WERE PLAYING A CARD GAME, AND THEY'RE SAYING
utt_0109 utt 495.01 500.74 -X THAT THIS OTHER PERSON WEARING THE HOLOLENS CAN SEE MY REACTION TO THE CARDS THAT I CAN ONLY SEE.
utt_0111 utt 500.74 503.53 -X SO IT GAVE THEM MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CARD GAME.
utt_0112 utt 503.53 510.98 -X SO LEARNING FROM THIS WE DEVISED A SET OF DESIGN STRATAGIES IN IMPLEMENTING THESE RESULTS
utt_0113 utt 511.84 518.22 -X IN YOUR OWN EMOTION COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS FOR DESIGNERS BUILDING THEM IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0114 utt 518.69 524.49 -X SO WE GO EXTENSIVELY INTO THIS IN THE PAPER, I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME NOW SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.
utt_0116 utt 524.77 535.30 -X AND THEN GOING BEYOND NEO-NOUMENA, SO FOR MY PHD I'M CURRENTLY BUILDING MY FRAMEWORK OF INTEGRATED CONSCIOUSNESS, WHICH THIS AND THE PREVIOUS STUDY I HAVE CONDUCTED HAS INFORMED.
utt_0118 utt 535.30 541.96 -X THE NEXT STEP IS A SYSTEM I'M DESIGNING NOW CALLED PSINET, WHICH IS LOOKING AT HOW WE
utt_0119 utt 543.84 555.31 -X CAN INTERPERSONALLY INTEGRATE CONSCIOUSNESS NOT THROUGH SOME SORT OF SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION LIKE IN NEO-NOUMENA, BUT THROUGH DIRECT NEURAL STIMULATION THROUGH TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION.
utt_0122 utt 556.49 561.83 -X SO YEAH HOPEFULLY THIS PAPER GETS INTO CHI NEXT YEAR AND YOU ALL GET TO HEAR ME TALK ABOUT THAT THEN.
utt_0124 utt 562.66 575.02 -X BUT UNTIL THEN, THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, AND THERE IS ANYTHING I HOPE YOU TAKE HOME AFTER THIS, IS THE NOTION THAT THROUGH TECHNOLOGY ONE CAN ACCESS (AND HOPEFULLY ONE DAY FULLY EXPERIENCE) THE SUBJECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ANOTHER.
utt_0127 utt 575.02 575.75 -1.4832 THANK YOU
