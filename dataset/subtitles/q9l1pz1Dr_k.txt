utt_0000 utt 0.30 5.07 -X HELLO AND WELCOME TO THIS PRESENTATION ON SHARING TRAJECTORIES WITH LOCAL DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY.
utt_0001 utt 5.26 11.15 -X THIS IS WORK DONE BY MYSELF, GRAHAM, AND HAKAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK AND DIVESH OF AT&AMPT.
utt_0002 utt 12.68 21.90 -X WE MOTIVATE OUR WORK BY NOTING THAT TRAJECTORY DATA IS HIGHLY USEFUL FOR RESEARCHERS AND ANALYSTS. HOWEVER, EXISTING DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE MECHANISMS FOR DOING
utt_0004 utt 21.90 35.28 -X SO ARE RESTRICTIVE AND LIMITED IN THEIR UTILITY. AS FAR AS APPLICATIONS ARE CONCERNED, OUR WORK CAN BE USED IN SOCIETAL CONTACT TRACING, AS WELL AS OTHER URBAN APPLICATIONS SUCH, AS ADVERTISING
utt_0006 utt 36.17 47.19 -X WE CONTEXTUALIZE OUR WORK BY NOTING THAT ALTHOUGH TRAJECTORY SHARING IS WELL-RESEARCHED IN THE CENTRALIZED DP SETTING, IT IS LESS WELL-STUDIED IN THE LOCAL SETTING IN WHICH USERS PERTURB THEIR
utt_0008 utt 47.19 54.51 -X OWN DATA BEFORE SHARING WITH AN AGGREGATOR. IN OUR WORK, WE USE A DISTANCE-BASED LDP MECHANISM.
utt_0009 utt 54.61 66.10 -X ALTHOUGH SIMILAR LDP-INSPIRED MECHANISMS ARE PLENTIFUL NONE OF THESE CITED WORKS SATISFY STRICT EPSILON LDO WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE A WEAKER PRIVACY GUARANTEE.
utt_0011 utt 66.10 73.71 -X AND SO TO OUR PROBLEM IN WHICH WE MODEL TRAJECTORIES AS TIME-ORDERED SEQUENCES OF PLACES OF INTEREST WITH AN EXAMPLE SHOWN HERE.
utt_0013 utt 75.79 86.52 -X OUR AIM IS TO PERTURB THESE TRAJECTORIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH LDP WHILST ENSURING THAT WE ACHIEVE HIGH UTILITY AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL. WE AIM TO BOOST UTILITY BY USING A RANGE OF PUBLICLY
utt_0015 utt 86.52 96.31 -X AVAILABLE EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE TO INFLUENCE PERTURBATION PROBABILITIES. A TERTIARY AIM IS TO DEVELOP AN EFFICIENT MECHANISM THAT IS SCALABLE FOR REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION
utt_0017 utt 99.06 103.57 -X WE NOW INTRODUCE THE TWO PRIVACY DEFINITIONS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO OUR SOLUTION.
utt_0018 utt 103.98 116.18 -X FAMILIAR TO MANY WILL BE THE DEFINITION OF LOCAL DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY AS SHOWN HERE. IN SHORT LDP PROVIDES A PRIVACY GUARANTEE TO USERS WHO PERTURB THEIR DATA BEFORE SHARING IT WITH AN AGGREGATOR.
utt_0020 utt 118.80 127.93 -X ALSO FAMILIAR TO MANY WILL BE THE EXPONENTIAL MECHANISM WHICH USES A QUALITY OR DISTANCE FUNCTION TO CONTROL THE PROBABILITY THAT ANY ONE RESPONSE IS RETURNED.
utt_0022 utt 130.39 143.00 -X SO WHAT INFORMATION IS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE? WELL, WE DEEM SOME ATTRIBUTES OF POIS SUCH AS LOCATIONS, OPENING HOURS, CATEGORY, AND POPULARITY AS CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN
utt_0024 utt 143.00 147.70 -X BE USED TO BOOST UTILITY AND RULE OUT ILLOGICAL OUTPUTS. IMPORTANTLY,
utt_0025 utt 147.76 151.89 -X AS THEY ARE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE, WE DO NOT NEED TO ADD NOISE WHEN USING THIS DATA.
utt_0026 utt 154.93 165.78 -X WE INCORPORATE PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THROUGH SEMANTIC DISTANCE FUNCTIONS WHICH RELATE THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN POIS. FOR EXAMPLE, A RESTAURANT AND A BAR WILL HAVE A LOW SEMANTIC DISTANCE,
utt_0028 utt 165.78 170.45 -X WHEREAS A BAR AND A BOWLING ALLEY WILL HAVE A HIGH SEMANTIC DISTANCE.
utt_0029 utt 171.60 176.39 -X BEFORE MOVING ON TO OUR SOLUTIONS WE INTRODUCE A FINAL UTILITY ENHANCING CONSTRAINT
utt_0030 utt 176.82 187.00 -X TO ENSURE LOGICAL OUTPUT TRAJECTORIES ARE PREVENTED WE DEFINE THE NOTION OF REACHABILITY FOR ADJACENT POIS. THIS ENSURES THAT AN OUTPUT TRAJECTORY DOES NOT HAVE SOMEONE
utt_0032 utt 187.00 200.34 -X TRAVELLING FROM LONDON TO, SAY, COPENHAGEN WITHIN twenty MINUTES. HERE THE YELLOW BLOBS ARE REACHABLE FROM THE BLUE BLOB BUT THE RED ONES ARE DEEMED UNREACHABLE. OUR SO-CALLED
utt_0034 utt 200.34 204.66 -X GLOBAL SOLUTION MODELS ENTIRE TRAJECTORIES AS SINGULAR POINTS IN HIGH DIMENSIONAL SPACE.
utt_0035 utt 205.01 215.22 -X ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE THEORETICALLY OPTIMAL, IT REQUIRES INSTANTIATING ALL TRAJECTORIES WHICH QUICKLY BECOMES INTRACTABLE, AS ILLUSTRATED WITH THIS SMALL-SCALE EXAMPLE.
utt_0037 utt 216.47 228.41 -X ALTHOUGH SOME TECHNIQUES EXIST TO SPEED UP THE EXPONENTIAL MECHANISM, WE FIND THAT TOO MUCH UTILITY IS SACRIFICED FOR EFFICIENCY IN THESE CASES. HENCE, WE MOVE TO CONSIDER
utt_0039 utt 228.41 239.55 -X AN N-GRAM-BASED SOLUTION IN WHICH WE PERTURB TRAJECTORY FRAGMENTS. THIS HELPS US TO PRESERVE SPATIO-TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS -- AN INTEGRAL PART OF PRIVATELY SHARING TRAJECTORY DATA.
utt_0041 utt 240.18 245.79 -X OVERLAPPING THE N-GRAMS HELPS US TO PRESERVE MANY CORRELATIONS FOR EACH TRAJECTORY POINT.
utt_0042 utt 247.54 260.79 -X TO ENSURE OUR MECHANISM IS EVEN MORE EFFICIENT, WE PARTITION OUR SPACE BY EXPLOITING THE INTRINSIC HIERARCHIES THAT EXIST IN OUR PUBLIC DATA. THIS ALLOWS US TO CREATE SPACE-TIME-CATEGORY REGIONS, OR STC REGIONS FOR SHORT.
utt_0045 utt 263.09 269.85 -X HERE IS A SUMMARY OF OUR MECHANISM. WE FIRST TRANSLATE OUR TRAJECTORIES TO THE STC REGION LEVEL.
utt_0047 utt 270.23 277.47 -X WE THEN PERTURB OVERLAPPING N-GRAMS AT THE REGION LEVEL BEFORE RECONSTRUCTING A FEASIBLE TRAJECTORY.
utt_0048 utt 277.47 283.16 -X A FINAL POST-PROCESSING STEP IS TO CONVERT THE RECONSTRUCTED TRAJECTORY BACK TO THE POI LEVEL.
utt_0049 utt 285.46 289.37 -X SO HOW EXACTLY DO WE USE HIERARCHIES?
utt_0050 utt 289.37 299.80 -X FIRST, WE CAN PUT POIS INTO SPACE-CATEGORY REGIONS, AS ILLUSTRATED HERE.
utt_0051 utt 300.57 305.12 -X TIME CAN ALSO BE INCLUDED. OPENING HOURS, ASSUMED TO BE PUBLIC,
utt_0052 utt 305.12 315.29 -X CAN BE UTILIZED TO ALLOW POIS TO APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR AS THEY OPEN AND CLOSE.
utt_0053 utt 315.29 322.04 -X FINALLY, WE CAN MERGE REGIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR POI POPULARITY, ANOTHER PUBLICLY KNOWN ATTRIBUTE.
utt_0054 utt 322.04 328.06 -X MERGING REGIONS ALSO PROVIDES EFFICIENCY BENEFITS BY REDUCING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF STC REGIONS.
utt_0055 utt 331.80 336.51 -X ONCE WE HAVE PARTITIONED OUR SPACE, WE DEFINE THE SET OF REACHABLE N-GRAMS.
utt_0056 utt 336.51 341.57 -X HAVING DONE SO, WE CAN NOW PERTURB OVERLAPPING N-GRAMS USING THE EXPONENTIAL MECHANISM,
utt_0057 utt 341.57 356.46 -X AS ILLUSTRATED ON SCREEN. WE ALSO PERFORM SUPPLEMENTARY PERTURBATION WITH SHORTER N-GRAMS TO ENSURE THAT EACH POINT IS COVERED N TIMES. A CONSEQUENCE OF PERTURBING OVERLAPPING N-GRAMS
utt_0059 utt 356.46 368.86 -X IS THAT EACH POINT HAS N POIS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. HENCE, WE DEFINE AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM TO FIND A TRAJECTORY THAT MINIMIZES THE SEMANTIC DISTANCE TO THE PERTURBED N-GRAMS. IMPORTANTLY,
utt_0061 utt 368.89 382.50 -X THIS PROCESS ONLY USES NON-PRIVATE DATA WHICH MEANS WE CAN INVOKE LDP'S POST-PROCESSING PROPERTY AND NOT SPEND ANY OF THE PRIVACY BUDGET. HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PROCESS:
utt_0063 utt 383.16 389.15 -X WE FIND THE MINIMUM ERROR TRAJECTORY, ILLUSTRATED HERE AS MERGING COLORFUL BLOBS.
utt_0064 utt 390.04 402.08 -X THE OUTPUT IS A RECONSTRUCTED TRAJECTORY ON THE STC REGION LEVEL. NOTE THAT REACHABILITY IS SATISFIED BY THE RECONSTRUCTED TRAJECTORY.
utt_0066 utt 402.52 412.19 -X AS A FINAL POST PROCESSING STEP, WE SAMPLE POIS FROM THE STC REGIONS OF THE RECONSTRUCTED TRAJECTORY. THIS ENSURES THE FINAL OUTPUT TRAJECTORY
utt_0068 utt 412.19 417.66 -X IS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS THE INPUT TRAJECTORY. THAT IS, ON THE POI LEVEL.
utt_0069 utt 419.71 431.86 -X WE COMPARE OUR N-GRAM METHOD TO FOUR OTHER METHODS. THE FIRST TWO METHODS INDEPENDENTLY PERTURB POIS AND TIME STEPS. INDREACH ONLY PERTURBS TO REACHABLE POIS WHEREAS INDNOREACH
utt_0071 utt 431.86 438.21 -X ALLOWS PERTURBATION TO ANY POI. THE NEXT TWO METHODS USE OUR N-GRAM APPROACH. PHYSDIST DOES
utt_0072 utt 438.27 444.64 -X NOT CONSIDER EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE WHEREAS NGRAMNOH DOES NOT USE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED N-GRAMS
utt_0073 utt 447.20 461.54 -X WE EVALUATE OUR MECHANISM USING THREE DATASETS. THESE EITHER USE THE REAL DATA DIRECTLY OR AS THE BASIS FOR SEMI-SYNTHETIC TRAJECTORIES. YOU CAN SEE A SUMMARY OF THE DATASETSâ€™ CHARACTERISTICS HERE.
utt_0075 utt 462.75 474.40 -X THIS TABLE SHOWS THE SEMANTIC DISTANCE BETWEEN THE REAL AND PERTURBED TRAJECTORIES IN EACH OF THE THREE MAIN DIMENSIONS. WE NORMALIZE VALUES TO BE BETWEEN zero AND 1zero AND CALL THIS THE NORMALIZED
utt_0077 utt 474.40 479.71 -X ERROR. WE SEE THAT NGRAM -- OUR METHOD -- IS GENERALLY THE BEST PERFORMING METHOD.
utt_0078 utt 480.48 491.65 -X WE CAN ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFIT OF USING EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE AS SHOWN HERE, AND THE BENEFIT OF USING HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED N-GRAMS AS HIGHLIGHTED NOW.
utt_0080 utt 494.50 498.76 -X WE NOW EVALUATE THE AVERAGE RUNTIME OF THE MECHANISMS BROKEN DOWN BY STAGES.
utt_0081 utt 499.36 507.40 -X AS EXPECTED, THE TWO BASELINES THAT DO NOT USE OPTIMIZATION ARE VERY QUICK ALTHOUGH OUR METHOD IS THE FASTEST N-GRAM-BASED METHOD.
utt_0083 utt 509.54 522.66 -X INTERESTINGLY, UP TO ninety-nine% OF THE RUNTIME FOR ENGRAM-BASED METHODS IS SPENT USING OPTIMIZATION TO RECONSTRUCT TRAJECTORIES BETTER SOLVERS OR HEURISTICS CAN BE USED IF NECESSARY
utt_0085 utt 523.23 536.49 -X THE GRAPHS HERE SHOW THE CHANGE IN NORMALIZED ERROR AS A NUMBER OF KEY MECHANISM AND DATASET PARAMETERS ARE VARIED. AS IS EVIDENT, OUR SOLUTION (IN GREEN) IS CONSISTENTLY THE BEST PERFORMING
utt_0087 utt 536.49 551.05 -X MECHANISM. THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF PHYSDIST (IN YELLOW) FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE IN PERTURBATION. AND HERE IS HOW CHANGING KEY PARAMETERS AFFECT AVERAGE
utt_0089 utt 551.05 557.03 -X RUNTIME AGAIN. OUR MECHANISM PERFORMS WELL, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERED JOINTLY WITH ACCURACY
utt_0090 utt 560.42 575.08 -X IN CONCLUSION, USING EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE AND OVERLAPPING N-GRAMS AND PERTURBATION ENSURES TRAJECTORIES CAN BE SHARED LOCALLY WITH STRONG PRIVACY GUARANTEES AND HIGH UTILITY. OUR SOLUTION CAN BE GENERALIZED OR EXTENDED TO A RANGE OF
utt_0093 utt 575.08 582.82 -3.8158 OTHER SETTINGS AND WE LEAVE THIS TO FUTURE WORK. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
