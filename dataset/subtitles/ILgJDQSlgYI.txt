utt_0000 utt 0.16 8.58 -X HELLO I AM STEPHANIE VALENCIA AND TODAY I WILL SHARE ABOUT OUR WORK ON CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY IN AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION
utt_0002 utt 11.72 25.57 -X AAC STANDS FOR AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION PEOPLE WITH SPEECH AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS MAY COMMUNICATE USING AAC DEVICES IN THE VIDEO THAT IS PLAYING AN AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR IS SELECTING WORDS ON HER
utt_0005 utt 25.57 27.22 -X AAC DEVICE TO SPEAK
utt_0006 utt 28.94 43.44 -X IN THE SECOND VIDEO THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR IS TYPING AN ANSWER TO AN INTERVIEW QUESTION WHILE SHE TYPES HER ANSWER, HER DAD ANSWERS THE QUESTION ON HER BEHALF BY THE TIME SHE HAS FINISHED TYPING THE CONVERSATION HAS ALREADY
utt_0009 utt 43.44 48.74 -X MOVED ON BECAUSE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS HAVE TO FIRST TYPE BEFORE SPEAKING
utt_0010 utt 48.78 58.99 -X IT IS OFTEN CHALLENGING TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY ON THE RIGHT MOMENT IN CONVERSATION IN THIS INSTANCE THIS AC WAS ABLE TO
utt_0012 utt 58.99 70.55 -X SPEAK HER THOUGHTS BUT IN MANY CASES ACS OR AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS DO NOT GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK IT IS SO MUCH SO THAT SOME AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS EVEN
utt_0014 utt 70.55 82.58 -X MAKE THE SPINS THAT SAY WAIT fifteen SECONDS I CAN COMMUNICATE OR I AM WORTH THE WAIT LET ME COMMUNICATE ILLUSTRATING THAT COMMUNICATING REQUIRES MORE THAN THE
utt_0016 utt 82.58 91.96 -X ABILITY TO SPEAK HAVING A PARTNER THAT IS WILLING TO WAIT AND LISTEN IS ALSO NEEDED FOR COMMUNICATION PARTNERS CAN IMPACT THE WAY PEOPLE ADVANCE THEIR
utt_0018 utt 91.96 105.29 -X GOALS IN CONVERSATION SOMETHING WE CALL CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY BUT HOW AND HOW MUCH WHAT ELSE IMPACTS AAC CONVERSATIONS IN THIS WORK WE STUDY CONVERSATIONAL
utt_0020 utt 105.29 117.19 -X AGENCY IN AAC HOW PEOPLE ADVANCE THEIR GOALS AND CONVERSATIONS UNDER SOCIAL AND AAC CONSTRAINTS PRIOR WORK HAS FOCUSED ON MAKING AAC DEVICES FASTER
utt_0022 utt 117.19 127.54 -X SMARTER AND HAVE WORKED ON COMPARED COMPETENCY BUILDING TO ENABLE COMMUNICATION BUT IN OUR WORK WE INSTEAD FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING HOW CLOSED
utt_0024 utt 127.54 142.01 -X CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS SUCH AS FAMILY MEMBERS OR PAID AIDES WHO KNOW THE AC WELL CAN SUPPORT AND IMPACT AN AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS' PARTICIPATION IN CONVERSATION WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE
utt_0027 utt 142.01 152.62 -X DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT IMPACT AC'S AGENCY CAN INFORM THE DESIGN OF SYSTEMS AND STRATEGIES THAT SUPPORT COMMUNICATION. CLOSED CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS HAVE BEEN
utt_0029 utt 152.62 163.88 -X KNOWN TO FACILITATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN ACS AND UNFAMILIAR THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE NOT MET THEM BEFORE BUT, UNTIL THIS MOMENT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY CAN
utt_0031 utt 163.88 173.93 -X IMPACT CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY. TO STUDY CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY WE SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER GIBSON'S DEFINITION FROM SOCIOLOGY WHICH EXPLAINS THAT
utt_0033 utt 173.93 186.25 -X INDIVIDUALS CAN EXERCISE AGENCY WHEN CONVERSATIONAL CONSTRAINTS LOOSEN ENOUGH FOR THEM TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONVERSATION SO FOR EXAMPLE WHO CAN
utt_0035 utt 186.25 194.17 -X SPEAK NEXT IS GOVERNED BY THE PARTICIPATION SHIFT CONSTRAINT WHICH STATES THAT THE PERSON BEING ADDRESSED HAS A HIGHER CHANCE OF SPEAKING NEXT
utt_0037 utt 196.57 210.94 -X CONSTRAINTS ALSO DICTATE HOW PEOPLE PARTICIPATE SO THE RITUAL CONSTRAINT STATES THAT PEOPLE COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER IN CONVERSATION TO MAINTAIN A POSITIVE SOCIAL STANDING SO IF SOMEBODY ASKS A QUESTION IT IS NATURAL TO EXPECT
utt_0040 utt 210.94 225.66 -X THE OTHER PERSON TO ANSWER IT A THIRD CONSTRAINT THE ONE SPEAKER CONSTRAINT DICTATES THAT ONLY ONE SPEAKER CAN SPEAK AT A TIME THE CURRENT SPEAKER HAS CONTROL OVER THE TIME THAT OTHERS HAVE TO START SPEAKING BEING ABLE
utt_0043 utt 225.66 240.57 -X TO TAKE THE FLOOR UNTIL THEY DESIRE AND FINALLY THE RELEVANCE CONSTRAINT STATES HOW IN CONVERSATION WE EXPECT COMMENTS TO BE CONNECTED TO PRIOR ONES THE RELEVANCE CONSTRAINT GOVERNS THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION
utt_0046 utt 243.32 254.14 -X GIBSON DEFINES TWO TYPES OF CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY: TECHNICAL AGENCY WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY PARTICIPATING IN CONVERSATION AND CONTRIBUTING AS DESIRED
utt_0048 utt 255.74 261.61 -X AND COLLOQUIAL AGENCY WHICH IS WHEN THIS PARTICIPATION LEADS TO ACHIEVING A GOAL
utt_0049 utt 262.10 272.38 -X YOU CANNOT HAVE COLLOQUIAL AGENCY WITHOUT TECHNICAL AGENCY CONVERSATIONAL CONSTRAINTS APPLY TO ALL TYPE OF CONVERSATIONS IN OUR WORK WE CONSIDER
utt_0051 utt 272.38 282.24 -X ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS THAT IMPACT AAC CONVERSATIONS SPECIFICALLY SUCH AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR AND THEIR SPEAKING
utt_0053 utt 282.24 295.73 -X PARTNER, THE DEVICE BEING USED AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS, AND FINALLY THE TASK AT HAND. IN STUDYING HOW CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY IN AAC IS IMPACTED UNDER THESE
utt_0055 utt 295.73 300.62 -X CONSTRAINTS WE ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS RESEARCH QUESTION one
utt_0056 utt 300.79 312.35 -X HOW DO CONVERSATIONAL DEVICE TASKS AND RELATIONSHIP CONSTRAINTS IMPACT CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS PARTICIPATION RESEARCH QUESTION two AND HOW DOES THIS
utt_0058 utt 312.35 321.84 -X CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNER PARTICIPATION IMPACT AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS' AGENCY AND FURTHERMORE WHEN DOES TECHNICAL AGENCY, WHEN
utt_0060 utt 322.20 333.60 -X AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE, TRANSLATES TO COLLOQUIAL AGENCY EFFECTIVELY ADVANCING THEIR GOALS? WE INVESTIGATE THESE QUESTIONS WITH A
utt_0062 utt 333.60 348.03 -X STUDY EXAMINING DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONAL TASKS TO CONTROL FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS. AN INTERVIEW TASK IN WHICH THE EXPERIMENTER ASKED QUESTIONS TO THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR WITH THEIR PARTNER PRESENT. A WAY-FINDING ACTIVITY
utt_0065 utt 348.03 360.13 -X WITH TWO CONDITIONS AND FINALLY A COLLABORATIVE CRAFT TASKS PLEASE SEE OUR PAPER FOR MORE DETAILS ON HOW THESE TASKS WERE STRUCTURED AND DESIGNED OUR
utt_0067 utt 360.13 364.37 -X PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED four AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING
utt_0068 utt 365.05 369.95 -X CCP OR CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL TASKS
utt_0069 utt 370.62 381.62 -X AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR PARTICIPANTS HAD A VARIETY OF INPUT MODES, HALF HAD THEIR DEVICE SET TO PHRASE-VOICE OUTPUT AND THE OTHER HALF USE THEIR DEVICE WITH AN
utt_0071 utt 381.62 394.40 -X UTTERANCE VOICE-OUTPUT. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT THAT MEANS. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW AN UTTERANCE-LEVEL VOICE OUTPUT IS LIKE, IN THIS CASE A PARTNER
utt_0073 utt 394.40 397.41 -X CAN HEAR THE UTTERANCES AS THE AC IS TYPING
utt_0074 utt 405.70 407.62 -X A-C-H I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH
utt_0075 utt 409.66 418.08 -X IN CONTRAST, THE PHRASE LEVEL VOICE OUTPUT DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FEEDBACK WHILE THE USER TYPES HERE IS AN EXAMPLE
utt_0076 utt 433.41 436.93 -X (PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING WHILE THE AC TYPES IN SILENCE)
utt_0077 utt 436.93 451.59 -X WE USE QUANTITATIVE VIDEO CODING ANALYSIS TO DEVELOP BOTH OVERALL AND TASK SPECIFIC METRICS FOR TECHNICAL AGENCY COLLOQUIAL AGENCY AND PARTICIPATION TO ADDRESS OUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FOR OUR ANNOTATIONS WE
utt_0080 utt 451.59 463.85 -X CONSIDERED THE AMOUNT OF CONVERSATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS AND THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS AND IDENTIFY THEM AS PARTICIPATION EVENTS PARTICIPATION EVENTS INCLUDED ANY
utt_0083 utt 463.85 474.69 -X SPEAKING TYPING OR GESTURING AFTER THAT WE LABELLED EACH PARTICIPATION EVENT WITH SPECIFIC COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTION TYPES SUCH AS CONFIRMING INFORMATION
utt_0085 utt 474.69 485.45 -X DISAGREEING OR SUGGESTING AN IDEA MORE INFORMATION ON OUR LABELS CAN BE FOUND IN THE PAPER FINALLY WE ALSO EXAMINED THE RESULTING ARTIFACTS OF THE MAP AND
utt_0087 utt 485.45 495.05 -X CRAFT TASK TO EVALUATE HOW PARTICIPATING OR EXPRESSING TECHNICAL AGENCY IMPACTED THE RESULTING MAP OR CRAFT TO MEASURE COLLOQUIAL AGENCY
utt_0089 utt 497.03 505.86 -X FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS TALK I WILL GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FINDINGS FOR EACH RESEARCH QUESTION I ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT OUR PAPER TO FIND MORE DETAILED FINDINGS
utt_0092 utt 507.91 522.54 -X FOR RESEARCH QUESTION ONE I WILL SHARE A RESULTS REGARDING HOW CONVERSATIONAL CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED CLOSE CONVERSATION PARTNER PARTICIPATION WE FOUND THAT ADDRESSING AN AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR DIRECTLY LIKE IN THE INTERVIEW TASKS
utt_0095 utt 522.60 533.39 -X REDUCED THE PARTICIPATION OF THEIR CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS RITUALS SUCH AS DOUBLE CHECKING AND ANSWER WITH THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR AND ASKING THEM
utt_0097 utt 533.39 543.87 -X IF THEY WANTED SUPPORT INCREASED THEIR PARTICIPATION WHEN CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS TOOK LONG TURNS THEY ALSO DOMINATED THE CONVERSATION
utt_0099 utt 543.87 550.07 -X STOPPING CHANGING IT RAPIDLY BEFORE THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR HAD THE TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONVERSATION
utt_0101 utt 551.62 565.93 -X AND FINALLY AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR PARTICIPANTS WHO USED THEIR DEVICE WITH AN UTTERANCE LEVEL OUTPUT PARTICIPATED MORE AND WERE INTERRUPTED LESS BY THEIR PARTNERS IN RESEARCH QUESTION two WE ARE
utt_0104 utt 566.25 577.55 -X INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE CHANGES IN CLOSE CONVERSATION PARTNER PARTICIPATION IMPACTED AC AGENCY WE FOUND THAT PARTNER SUPPORTING AGENCY BY
utt_0106 utt 577.55 588.24 -X INCREASING INFORMATION EXCHANGED AT A LOWER COST BY PROVIDING EXPLANATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR AND INTERPRETING AND ENGAGING IN NONVERBAL
utt_0108 utt 588.24 599.29 -X COMMUNICATION BUT GIVING LONG EXPLANATIONS OFTEN INTRODUCED NEW TOPICS THAT MADE IT HARD FOR THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR TO KEEP UP THIS SOMETIMES
utt_0110 utt 599.29 606.25 -X MADE THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS DELETE THEIR MESSAGES OR CONTRIBUTE OFF-TOPIC COMMENTS THAT NEEDED TO BE CONTEXTUALIZED
utt_0112 utt 607.53 621.90 -X WHEN THE CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS GUESSED OR ANTICIPATED THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS THOUGHTS THAT INTRODUCED INCOMPLETE AND SOMETIMES INCORRECT INFORMATION THAT NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED AND ALSO LIMITED THE AUGMENTED
utt_0115 utt 621.90 625.65 -X COMMUNICATOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SHORT ANSWERS SUCH AS YES OR NO
utt_0116 utt 627.69 632.93 -X OUR THIRD RESEARCH QUESTION LOOKED AT HOW PARTICIPATING IMPACTED ADVANCING GOALS
utt_0117 utt 633.51 647.90 -X FOR THE CRAFT TASK WE FOUND THAT ALL OF THE IDEAS PROPOSED BY AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS APPEARED ON THE FINAL CRAFTS THE TRANSLATION FROM PARTICIPATING OR TECHNICAL AGENCY TO GOAL REALIZATION COLLOQUIAL AGENCY WAS
utt_0120 utt 647.90 662.80 -X CONTINGENT UPON COOPERATION WITH CLOSED CONVERSATIONAL PARTNERS AND MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH INTERDEPENDENT EFFORT SUCH AS HAVING THE CLOSE CONVERSATIONAL PARTNER CARRY OUT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR IN THIS
utt_0123 utt 662.80 669.20 -X EXAMPLE PARTICIPANT PAIR four DISCUSS IDEAS AND WORK TOGETHER TO REALIZE THEM
utt_0124 utt 669.48 681.07 -X SO THE PARTNERS FIRST THE CLOSE COMMERCIAL PARTNER SUGGESTS WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO A PINEAPPLE? AND THE AUGMENTED COMMUNICATOR REPLIES: THINKING OF A COMMA
utt_0126 utt 681.07 692.24 -X LEI I WAS THINKING OF A LEI A LEI OKAY THERE IS PINK AROUND SOMEWHERE THE PARTNER FINALLY REPLIES WHERE WE CAN OBSERVE THIS COLLABORATION HAPPENING
utt_0128 utt 692.24 701.68 -X BUILDING ON OUR INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF AC INTERACTIONS UNDER DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS WE SUGGEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND
utt_0130 utt 701.68 714.13 -X AND PROMOTE AC CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY WE CAN IMAGINE TECHNOLOGIES THAT REGULATE TURN-TAKING OR MAKE USE OF SOCIAL RITUALS TO DEVELOP
utt_0132 utt 714.13 728.40 -X INTERACTIVE TALKING POINTS TO REMIND PARTNERS HOW TO BEST REGULATE THEIR CONVERSATION WE CAN ALSO FURTHER DEVELOP WAYS TO SUPPORT AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS IN HOLDING THE FLOOR AS THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR MESSAGES AND DEVELOP TOOLS TO
utt_0135 utt 728.40 742.29 -X FACILITATE THE RETRIEVAL OF A SPECIFIC TOPIC OR COMMENT SO THAT AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS CAN ADDRESS A TOPIC EVEN IF THE CONVERSATION HAS MOVED ON TO CONCLUDE OUR RESEARCH CONFIRMS CONVERSATIONAL AGENCY AS A USEFUL FRAME
utt_0138 utt 742.29 747.08 -X TO CONSIDER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OF AUGMENTED COMMUNICATORS IN CONVERSATION
utt_0139 utt 747.60 759.89 -X ENABLING EQUAL CONTROL OVER CONVERSATIONAL CONSTRAINTS MAY LEAD TO MORE EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN CONVERSATION I WANT TO THANK OUR PARTICIPANTS IN THIS RESEARCH AS WELL AS MY CO-AUTHORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH
