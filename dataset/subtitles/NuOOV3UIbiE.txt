utt_0000 utt 0.38 4.46 -X HI, I'M JENS EMIL GRØNBÆK FROM AARHUS UNIVERSITY IN DENMARK.
utt_0001 utt 4.56 9.81 -X THIS RESEARCH IS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH CO-AUTHORS FROM AARHUS - MAJKEN, KIM AND MARIANNE
utt_0002 utt 9.96 13.39 -X AND IS SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT RESEARCH AND THE CAVI LAB.
utt_0003 utt 14.03 24.59 -X THE TALK IS ABOUT KIRIGAMITABLE – A SHAPE-CHANGING INTERACTIVE TABLETOP – DESIGNED TO SUPPORT TRANSITIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM WORK.
utt_0004 utt 24.59 29.36 -X THE CORE MOTIVATION OF THIS RESEARCH IS DESIGNING FOR TRANSITIONS IN COLLABORATIVE WORK.
utt_0005 utt 30.00 33.49 -X IN A PREVIOUS PAPER, WE COINED THE TERM PROXEMIC TRANSITIONS
utt_0006 utt 33.55 38.10 -X TO ARTICULATE THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY BETWEEN PEOPLE, COMPUTERS AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0007 utt 38.70 40.55 -X IN A FIELD STUDY, WE FOUND THAT
utt_0008 utt 40.62 45.55 -X DURING TRANSITIONS PEOPLE OFTEN ADAPT TO THE ENVIRONMENT FOR CO-LOCATED COLLABORATION.
utt_0009 utt 46.00 50.29 -X IMAGINE IF WE COULD INSTEAD PHYSICALLY RECONFIGURE THE COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0010 utt 51.79 57.01 -X THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT POTENTIALS OF SHAPE-CHANGING INTERFACES AT THE SCALE OF FURNITURE.
utt_0011 utt 57.58 61.40 -X RESEARCHERS SUCH AS TAKASHIMA ET AL. AND ISHII ET AL.
utt_0012 utt 61.71 67.00 -X HAVE CONTRIBUTED PROTOTYPE CONCEPTS OF BOTH SHAPE-CHANGING TABLETOPS AND WALL DISPLAYS.
utt_0013 utt 67.15 70.96 -X THESE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING TRANSITIONS IN COLLABORATIVE WORK,
utt_0014 utt 71.41 78.96 -X BUT MOST OF THIS PRIOR RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON TRIGGERING SHAPE-CHANGES AND NOT SO MUCH ON THE ACTUAL INTERFACE TRANSITIONS.
utt_0016 utt 81.20 84.98 -X IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THIS GAP, WE DEVELOPED KIRIGAMITABLE.
utt_0017 utt 85.30 88.76 -X WITH KIRIGAMITABLE, WE MAKE THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTIONS:
utt_0018 utt 91.09 95.89 -X A NOVEL USER INTERFACE THAT SUPPORTS COLLABORATION AROUND SHAPE-CHANGING TABLETOPS,
utt_0019 utt 96.59 101.17 -X A SET OF INTERACTION TECHNIQUES THAT COMBINE SHAPE AND CONTENT TRANSFORMATIONS,
utt_0020 utt 102.03 106.23 -X AND DEMONSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF KIRIGAMI ACTUATION FOR TABLETOPS.
utt_0021 utt 106.96 111.93 -X I'LL STRUCTURE THIS TALK BY GOING THROUGH EACH OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS.
utt_0022 utt 111.93 115.38 -X FIRST, LET ME SHOW YOU A CLIP OF THE POSSIBLE SHAPE-CHANGES WITH KIRIGAMITABLE
utt_0023 utt 134.32 139.74 -X OUR FIRST CONTRIBUTION IS THE DESIGN OF THE USER INTERFACE FOR KIRIGAMITABLE.
utt_0024 utt 140.24 146.46 -X AS YOU SAW IN THE VIDEO, THE TABLE SUPPORTS THREE CONFIGURATIONS: FLAT-FOLD, FOUR-FOLD AND TWO-FOLD,
utt_0025 utt 146.77 153.43 -X AND THE USER INTERFACE IS DESIGNED TO EXPLOIT THE QUALITIES OF THESE CONFIGURATIONS FOR TRANSITIONS IN COLLABORATIVE WORK.
utt_0027 utt 154.13 157.18 -X I'LL FIRST BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW THE PROTOTYPE IS IMPLEMENTED.
utt_0028 utt 158.84 167.19 -X FOR THE DISPLAY, WE USE DYNAMIC PROJECTION MAPPING WHERE THE CURRENT STATE FROM THE ACTUATORS IS USED AS INPUT TO ADAPT THE GRAPHICS IN REAL-TIME.
utt_0030 utt 168.95 174.27 -X AND AN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: ALL THE INTERACTIONS YOU WILL SEE ARE SIMULATED VIA WIZARD OF OZ.
utt_0031 utt 174.27 179.67 -X I'LL NOW TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DEVELOPED FOR THE USER INTERFACE.
utt_0032 utt 180.09 185.47 -X WE SEE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR KIRIGAMITABLE IN SUPPORTING THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF CREATIVE WORK.
utt_0033 utt 185.94 191.84 -X TO INFORM THE INTERACTION DESIGN, WE DEVELOPED AN APPLICATION SCENARIO.
utt_0034 utt 191.84 196.54 -X THE SCENARIO IS BASED ON ANALYSIS OF CREATIVE COLLABORATIVE PRACTICES,
utt_0035 utt 196.70 202.17 -X AND WE FOUND THAT THEY OFTEN INVOLVE TRANSITIONS IN THE PHYSICAL CONFIGURATION OF PEOPLE.
utt_0036 utt 202.39 207.13 -X WE HAVE FOCUSED ON ONE EXAMPLE: INSPIRATION CARD WORKSHOPS.
utt_0037 utt 208.47 215.81 -X IT IS A COLLABORATIVE WORKSHOP FORMAT WHERE TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS AND DOMAIN EXPERTS CO-DEVELOPED DESIGN CONCEPTS TOGETHER.
utt_0038 utt 216.51 222.14 -X KIRIGAMITABLE IS WELL-SUITED FOR THIS USE CASE:
utt_0039 utt 222.14 232.93 -X THE WORKSHOP HAS A WELL-DEFINED STRUCTURE THAT TAKES PARTICIPANTS THROUGH TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CONFIGURATIONS – WORKING IN SUB-TEAMS, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS A WHOLE TEAM.
utt_0041 utt 233.56 236.99 -X I'LL NOW PLAY A VIDEO OF THE USE CASE WITH KIRIGAMITABLE.
utt_0042 utt 317.57 322.76 -X SO, FOR SHAPE-CHANGING TABLETOPS IT IS NOT JUST THE CONTENTS THAT ARE DYNAMIC,
utt_0043 utt 322.94 326.31 -X BUT ALSO THE SHAPE OF THE INTERFACE.
utt_0044 utt 326.31 329.19 -X THIS REQUIRES THAT WE COMPLETELY RETHINK THE INTERACTION DESIGN.
utt_0045 utt 331.17 334.24 -X I'LL NOW EXPLAIN SOME OF OUR INTERACTION TECHNIQUES
utt_0046 utt 334.88 341.04 -X AND THESE TECHNIQUES ARE BASED ON OUR WORK OF ADDRESSING CORE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED IN PRIOR WORK
utt_0047 utt 341.28 347.67 -X AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION ALSO THAT THESE ARE JUST A FIRST EXPLORATION
utt_0048 utt 347.78 351.01 -X SO YOU SHOULD ONLY REGARD THEM AS DESIGN PROPOSALS.
utt_0049 utt 351.65 354.66 -X FOR THIS TALK, I WILL FOCUS ON A FEW EXAMPLES FROM THE PAPER.
utt_0050 utt 356.19 362.28 -X FIRST I'LL SHOW HOW WE HAVE EXPLORED DIFFERENT WAYS OF INITIATING TRANSFORMATIONS.
utt_0051 utt 363.52 369.64 -X WE DEMONSTRATE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT BOTH COMBINE CONTENT AND SHAPE TRANSFORMATION:
utt_0052 utt 369.64 374.66 -X THE SHAPE-FIRST WIDGET HAS THE THREE POSSIBLE SHAPE CONFIGURATIONS AS TOP MENU ITEMS
utt_0053 utt 374.91 377.29 -X FLAT-FOLD, FOUR-FOLD AND TWO-FOLD
utt_0054 utt 377.51 381.93 -X AND FOR EACH ONE, THE USER CAN THEN SELECT BETWEEN MEANINGFUL OPTIONS FOR THE CONTENT.
utt_0055 utt 383.04 388.81 -X THE CONTENT-FIRST WIDGET SUPPORTS THE REVERSE INTERACTION, STARTING FROM THE CONTENT ITEMS.
utt_0056 utt 408.39 413.96 -X A KEY DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO TECHNIQUES IS THAT THE SHAPE-FIRST WIDGET IS PERMANENTLY VISIBLE,
utt_0057 utt 413.96 421.77 -X WHEREAS THE CONTENT-FIRST WHIDGET APPEARS IN CONTEXT AFTER A USER HAS SELECTED A GROUP OF ITEMS.
utt_0058 utt 421.86 424.30 -X NOW, ANOTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION IS:
utt_0059 utt 424.30 428.23 -X WHAT HAPPENS TO DISPLAY CONTENTS DURING AND AFTER SHAPE TRANSFORMATIONS?
utt_0060 utt 428.23 434.70 -X I WILL HERE FOCUS ON ONE EXAMPLE FROM OUR TECHNIQUES THAT AIMS TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION.
utt_0061 utt 434.70 445.82 -X WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE VIDEOS IS THAT WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE SHAPE-CHANGES FOR APPLYING ACTIONS ON THE CONTENTS, SUCH AS SUBDIVIDING, DUPLICATING OR SHARING ITEMS
utt_0063 utt 446.28 450.86 -X BUT HOW CAN USERS ANTICIPATE SHAPE-CHANGES TO AFFECT THE CONTENT?
utt_0064 utt 450.92 461.36 -X WE SUGGEST A FEEDFORWARD MECHANISM INSPIRED BY LINDLBAUER ET AL., WHERE WE VIRTUALLY ALTER THE APPEARANCE OF THE KIRIGAMI SURFACE TO PREVIEW HOW CONTENT WILL BE RE-ORGANIZED.
utt_0066 utt 461.77 469.07 -X SPECIFICALLY, WE HIGHLIGHT EDGES ON THE SURFACE FOLDS AND ANIMATE THEM TO INDICATE ZONES FOR HOW CONTENTS ARE RE-ORGANIZED.
utt_0068 utt 469.45 472.91 -X YOU SAW A GLIMPSE OF IT EARLIER, BUT HERE IT IS IN A BIT MORE DETAIL.
