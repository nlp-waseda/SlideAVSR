utt_0000 utt 0.56 5.78 -X HELLO I AM AURÃ‰LIEN PERSONNAZ FROM CNRS, AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT TO YOU DORA THE EXPLORER.
utt_0001 utt 5.78 10.96 -X A SYSTEM LEVERAGING DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR VERY LARGE DATA EXPLORATION.
utt_0002 utt 10.96 14.70 -X THIS WORK WAS SUPERVISED BY SIHEM AMER YAHIA FROM CNRS,
utt_0003 utt 14.70 17.90 -X AND IT WAS A COLLABORATION WITH LAURE BERTI EQUILLE FROM IRD
utt_0004 utt 17.93 22.26 -X AND MAXIMILIAN FABRICIUS AND SRIVIDIA SUBRAMANIAN FROM THE MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE.
utt_0005 utt 22.51 29.42 -X IT WAS PART OF A EUROPEAN PROJECT CALLED INODE ABOUT OPEN DATA EXPLORATION.
utt_0006 utt 30.03 34.67 -X ONE OF THE USE CASES OF THIS EUROPEAN PROJECT WAS THE SDSS DATASET.
utt_0007 utt 35.63 42.96 -X THIS DATASET IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING FOR US FOR DATA EXPLORATION AS IT IS REALLY HUGE.
utt_0008 utt 42.99 47.89 -X IT'S MADE OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF RECORDS OF ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS,
utt_0009 utt 48.05 54.80 -X EACH OBJECT BEING REPRESENTED BY HUNDREDS OF VERY HARDLY INTELLIGIBLE NUMERICAL ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0010 utt 54.80 62.26 -X IN OUR CASE WE FOCUSED ON two point six MILLION GALAXIES WITH THE SEVEN ATTRIBUTES YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0011 utt 63.63 70.90 -X AS YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SAMPLE THE NATURE OF THE DATA ITSELF MAKES ITS EXPLORATION AND UNDERSTANDING VERY COMPLICATED.
utt_0013 utt 72.21 77.78 -X A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS COMPLEXITY IS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREEN PEA GALAXIES.
utt_0014 utt 78.03 84.08 -X THE GREEN PEA GALAXIES ARE THOSE UNCOMMON COMPACT GALAXIES LOOKING LIKE GREEN DOTS.
utt_0015 utt 84.08 88.21 -X THEY WERE ONLY DISCOVERED A FEW YEARS AGO BY VOLUNTEERS OF THE GALAXY ZOO PROJECT.
utt_0016 utt 88.69 97.07 -X THE GALAXY ZOO PROJECT IS A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT ALLOWING VOLUNTEERS TO CLASSIFY GALAXIES BASED ON SOME VISUAL FEATURES.
utt_0018 utt 97.93 100.72 -X WHAT'S INTERESTING IN THIS DISCOVERY IS THAT
utt_0019 utt 102.09 107.06 -X THESE GALAXIES WITH THEIR DATA WERE PRESENT SINCE THE BEGINNING IN THE SDSS DATASET,
utt_0020 utt 107.15 114.74 -X BUT THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN FOUND BY CHANCE, SINCE THERE WAS NO ADAPTED EXPLORATION TOOL.
utt_0021 utt 114.74 118.42 -X THIS BROUGHT US TO THE FIRST QUESTION WE TRIED TO ANSWER IN THIS WORK,
utt_0022 utt 118.42 121.94 -X WHICH IS: HOW DO WE NAVIGATE WITHIN SUCH A DATA SET?
utt_0023 utt 122.45 125.14 -X OUR PROPOSAL IS: EXPLORATION PIPELINES.
utt_0024 utt 125.61 132.85 -X AN EXPLORATION PIPELINE IS A SEQUENCE OF EXPLORATION OPERATORS CLOSED UNDER SET-BASED SEMANTICS.
utt_0026 utt 132.85 136.75 -X SO IN DORA, ALL THE EXPLORATION IS BASED ON ITEM SETS.
utt_0027 utt 137.52 140.92 -X AN ITEM SET IS DEFINED WITH A CONJUNCTION OF PREDICATES.
utt_0028 utt 141.58 147.35 -X HERE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF AN ITEM SET IN DORA, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF fifty-two GALAXIES,
utt_0029 utt 147.35 158.61 -X AND IS DEFINED BY THESE FOUR PREDICATES, WITH THE REDSHIFT WHICH IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EARTH AND THE GALAXY, THE R AND G ATTRIBUTES THAT ARE COLOR MAGNITUDES,
utt_0031 utt 158.61 163.16 -X AND THE PETRORAD ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS REPRESENTING THE COMPACITY OF THE GALAXY.
utt_0032 utt 166.48 173.94 -X TO COMPOSE THESE PIPELINES, WE HAVE DEFINED FOUR OPERATORS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF BY-EXAMPLE,
utt_0033 utt 173.94 179.60 -X WHICH MEANS THAT EACH OPERATOR TAKES AN ITEM SET AS INPUT,
utt_0034 utt 179.60 184.56 -X AND IS RETURNING ONE OR MORE ITEM SETS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE INPUT SET.
utt_0035 utt 185.55 199.38 -X HERE YOU CAN SEE DESCRIPTIONS OF EACH OF THESE OPERATORS WITH A VISUAL REPRESENTATION WHERE THE INPUT SET IS REPRESENTED WITH A PLAIN LINE AND THE RESULTING SETS ARE REPRESENTED WITH DOTTED LINES.
utt_0037 utt 199.82 204.18 -X THE TWO OPERATORS ON THE LEFT ARE BY-FACET AND BY-SUPERSET,
utt_0038 utt 204.34 210.07 -X WHICH ARE OUR IMPLEMENTATIONS OF USUAL DRILL-DOWN AND ROLL-UP OPERATORS.
utt_0039 utt 210.74 214.29 -X BY FACET SPLITS THE INPUT-SET ON A GIVEN ATTRIBUTE,
utt_0040 utt 214.38 220.12 -X AND BY-SUPERSET IS PROPOSING MULTIPLE RELAXATION OF THE PROVIDED INPUT-SET.
utt_0041 utt 220.53 227.32 -X THEN WE HAVE ADDED TWO OPERATORS THAT ARE OFFERING DIFFERENT EXPLORATION POSSIBILITIES.
utt_0042 utt 227.34 233.72 -X THE FIRST ONE IS BY-NEIGHBORS WHICH IS FINDING THE ITEM SETS IMMEDIATELY
utt_0043 utt 234.03 248.76 -X ABOVE AND BELOW THE INPUT SET ON PROVIDED ATTRIBUTES, AND FINALLY BY-DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS RETURNING ITEM SETS THAT ARE SHOWING THE SAME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PREDICATE VALUES.
utt_0045 utt 248.76 250.87 -X SO LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT DORA IN ACTION
utt_0046 utt 253.14 262.49 -X THIS IS THE INTERFACE OF DORA. IN THE OPERATOR SELECTION AREA, THE USERS CAN PICK THE OPERATOR THEY WANT TO EXECUTE AND THE ATTRIBUTES FOR THIS OPERATOR.
utt_0048 utt 262.93 270.23 -X SINCE WE START THE EXPLORATION ON THE WHOLE DATASET, WE HAVE TO START BY DOING A BY-FACET
utt_0049 utt 270.55 275.77 -X TO SPLIT THIS DATA SET ON THE PROVIDED ATTRIBUTE. IN THIS CASE WE WILL USE THE G MAGNITUDE.
utt_0050 utt 276.72 282.71 -X WE EXECUTE THE OPERATOR AND WE GET THE RESULTING ITEM SETS.
utt_0051 utt 283.95 292.05 -X HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL THE ITEM SETS ARE DEFINED BY A RANGE OF VALUES ON THE G MAGNITUDE, WHICH IS THE ONE WE USED FOR THE OPERATOR.
utt_0053 utt 294.42 300.18 -X SINCE THE LOWER THE VALUE IS ON THE COLOR MAGNITUDE, THE BRIGHTEST THE GALAXIES WILL BE
utt_0054 utt 300.37 309.14 -X ON ITS COLOR RANGE, THEN YOU CAN SEE THAT ALL THE ITEM SETS WITH THE LOWEST MAGNITUDE VALUES
utt_0055 utt 309.23 319.09 -X HAVE THE BRIGHTEST GALAXIES, WHILE WHEN WE GO TO HIGHER VALUES ITEM SETS THE GALAXIES ARE DARKER.
utt_0056 utt 319.09 327.03 -X SO LET'S PICK A ITEM SET WITH PRETTY BRIGHT GALAXIES AND LET'S DELVE DEEPER INTO IT WITH ANOTHER BY-FACET.
utt_0058 utt 328.95 334.95 -X WHICH IS THE CAPACITY OF THE GALAXIES. WE EXECUTE THE OPERATOR AND WE GET
utt_0059 utt 335.00 349.59 -X ONCE AGAIN THE RESULTING SETS. IN THIS CASE WE SEE THAT A LOWER PETRORAD VALUE BRINGS MORE COMPACT GALAXIES THAN A LARGE PETRORAD VALUE, WITH MORE DIFFUSE GALAXIES.
utt_0061 utt 350.48 355.51 -X LET'S PICK A SET OF COMPACT GALAXIES AND DELVE DEEPER INSIDE.
utt_0062 utt 355.60 368.09 -X LET'S DO ANOTHER BY-FACET THIS TIME ON THE R MAGNITUDE.
utt_0063 utt 368.09 372.79 -X HERE WE SEE VERY STRANGE LOOKING GALAXIES THAT ARE BLUE DOTS.
utt_0064 utt 373.04 375.48 -X THOSE ARE PROBABLY BLUEBERRY GALAXIES.
utt_0065 utt 376.31 383.99 -X WE CAN LOOK AT NEIGHBORING SETS FOR MAYBE MORE BLUEBERRY GALAXIES BY DOING BY-NEIGHBORS
utt_0066 utt 385.36 387.86 -X ON THE PETRORAD ATTRIBUTE.
utt_0067 utt 391.28 399.35 -X SO HERE WE GOT SOME PRETTY CLOSE RESULTS WITH SOME GALAXIES VERY SIMILAR BUT A LITTLE LESS BLUISH.
utt_0068 utt 399.35 402.22 -X NOW THOSE TWO ITEM SETS ARE VERY SMALL SO
utt_0069 utt 403.51 409.40 -X IT COULD BE INTERESTING TO GET SOME BIGGER ITEM SETS SO LET'S EXECUTE BY-SUPERSET ON THEM.
utt_0070 utt 415.67 420.25 -X FINALLY, WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED INTO GETTING MORE VARIETY IN THE RESULTS,
utt_0071 utt 420.40 424.03 -X SO WE CAN EXECUTE BY-DISTRIBUTION,
utt_0072 utt 424.03 428.25 -X WHICH WILL RETURN ALL THE SETS HAVING THE SAME DISTRIBUTION OF VALUES IN THEIR PREDICATES.
utt_0073 utt 429.69 440.22 -X SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE EXPLORATION PIPELINES AND EXPLORATION OPERATORS OFFER MANY POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPLORATION OF THE SDSS DATASET,
utt_0075 utt 440.28 447.77 -X BUT IT IS STILL PRETTY HARD TO ORIENT YOURSELF AND TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS APPLICATION.
utt_0076 utt 447.93 451.10 -X THIS BRINGS US TO THE SECOND QUESTION OF THIS WORK.
utt_0077 utt 452.09 456.47 -X HOW CAN WE GUIDE THE USERS IN THE EXPLORATION?
utt_0078 utt 456.47 461.91 -X SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXPLORATION LOGS WE HAD TO USE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO DEVELOP A GUIDANCE SYSTEM.
utt_0080 utt 462.29 468.06 -X TO THE APPLICATION WE'VE JUST DEMONSTRATED, WE HAVE ADDED AN OFFLINE PART.
utt_0081 utt 468.09 479.64 -X SO WE DEVELOPED SOME AthreeC DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AGENTS, THAT ARE INTERACTING WITH THE APPLICATION IN IN THE SAME WAY A USER WOULD THANKS TO AN ENVIRONMENT INTERFACE.
utt_0083 utt 481.37 483.77 -X WE TRAINED AGENTS OFFLINE FOR one hundred HOURS
utt_0084 utt 484.82 490.14 -X BY USING THE APPLICATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE.
utt_0085 utt 491.51 494.87 -X WHAT ARE THOSE TRAINING OBJECTIVES?
utt_0086 utt 494.87 498.33 -X THE DATA EXPLORATION CAN TAKE MULTIPLE FORMS.
utt_0087 utt 498.33 501.53 -X USERS MIGHT WANT A GLOBAL EXPLORATION OF THE DATASET,
utt_0088 utt 501.53 505.53 -X TO DISCOVER THE CONTENT OF IT IN ALL ITS VARIETY,
utt_0089 utt 505.53 512.67 -X OR THEY MIGHT WANT TO HAVE MORE LOCAL EXPLORATION BY FOCUSING ON A GIVEN AREA OF THE DATA SPACE.
utt_0090 utt 513.59 520.57 -X SO WHAT WE DID IS, WE TRAINED MULTIPLE AGENTS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES TO GET DIFFERENT MODELS,
utt_0091 utt 520.57 524.28 -X THAT WILL BE NEURAL NETWORKS SINCE WE USE DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING,
utt_0092 utt 524.28 528.03 -X WHICH WILL BE USED TO SUGGEST EXPLORATION ACTIONS TO THE USERS.
utt_0093 utt 528.73 534.14 -X EACH MODEL PROVIDES A DIFFERENT EXPLORATION STRATEGY FOR A GIVEN EXPLORATION SCENARIO.
utt_0094 utt 535.86 540.64 -X TO DEFINE THESE TRAINING OBJECTIVES, THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE TRAINING WE WORKED ON
utt_0095 utt 540.73 543.64 -X IS THE REWARD COMPUTATION.
utt_0096 utt 543.64 548.92 -X IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING, THE REWARD DEFINES THE INCENTIVE LEADING AN AGENT TO ACHIEVE A TASK.
utt_0097 utt 550.10 560.16 -X SO THE FIRST TYPE OF REWARD WE USED IN DORA IS THE FAMILIARITY REWARD WHICH CONSISTS IN REWARDING THE AGENT WHEN IT FINDS SOME PREDEFINED TARGET ITEMS.
utt_0099 utt 560.57 569.98 -X THIS IS THE USUAL TYPE OF REWARD THAT HAS BEEN USED IN MOST OF THE PREVIOUS WORKS ON REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPLIED TO EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.
utt_0101 utt 570.84 582.52 -X WITH THIS TYPE OF REWARD, EACH TARGET ITEM REPRESENTS A KIND OF MILESTONE IN THE DATA AND THE AGENT LEARNS THE FASTEST TRACK TO JOIN ALL THESE ITEMS.
utt_0103 utt 583.48 593.40 -X FAMILIARITY IS A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO DEVELOP SOME EXPLORATION STRATEGIES BUT IT IS INHERENTLY LIMITED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERSON DEFINING THE TARGET SET.
utt_0105 utt 593.59 596.60 -X TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM, WE DECIDED TO USE
utt_0106 utt 596.79 603.00 -X CURIOSITY REWARD, WHICH CONSISTS IN REWARDING THE AGENT WHEN IT VENTURES INTO UNEXPLORED STATES.
utt_0107 utt 603.58 608.28 -X THE CURIOSITY REWARD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED RECENTLY BY THE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING COMMUNITY
utt_0108 utt 608.44 611.55 -X AND HAS HAD SOME SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION TO GAMES.
utt_0109 utt 612.44 616.35 -X OUR IDEA IS THAT BY MIXING FAMILIARITY WITH CURIOSITY,
utt_0110 utt 616.41 624.35 -X THE AGENTS WILL TEND TO BE MORE ADVENTUROUS AND TO PROVIDE A WIDER EXPLORATION OF THE DATA SPACE.
utt_0111 utt 626.04 629.97 -X THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE TRAINING THAT WE WORKED ON TO DEFINE THESE OBJECTIVES
utt_0112 utt 630.17 632.64 -X IS THE DEFINITION OF THE TARGET SETS.
utt_0113 utt 633.18 638.75 -X THE TARGET SET IS THE SET OF ITEMS THE AGENT IS LOOKING FOR TO GET THE FAMILIARITY REWARD.
utt_0114 utt 639.74 652.45 -X THE FIRST TARGET SET WE DEFINED IS WHAT WE CALLED THE SCATTERED-SET, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF DIVERSE ITEMS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE DATA SET RESULTING IN GLOBAL EXPLORATION STRATEGIES.
utt_0116 utt 652.83 665.44 -X FOR THIS TARGET SET WE USED THE RESULTING CLASSIFICATION FROM THE GALAXY ZOO PROJECT AND WE SAMPLED EACH OF ITS one thousand, five hundred CLASSES OF GALAXIES TO BUILD THE TARGET SET.
utt_0118 utt 667.67 672.93 -X IN OPPOSITION TO THIS SCATTERED-SET WE DEVELOPED WHAT WE CALLED THE CONCENTRATED-SET,
utt_0119 utt 672.93 677.79 -X WHICH IS COMPOSED OF SIMILAR ITEMS SHARING THE SAME AREA IN THE DATA SET,
utt_0120 utt 677.95 681.12 -X WHICH RESULTS IN MORE LOCAL EXPLORATION STRATEGIES.
utt_0121 utt 681.50 695.49 -X FOR THE CONCENTRATED SETS, WE PICKED AT EACH EPISODE OF THE TRAINING A DIFFERENT CLASS OF THE GALAXY ZOO RESULTS, AND TRAIN THE AGENTS ONLY ON THESE GALAXIES.
utt_0123 utt 695.49 707.58 -X TO SUMMARIZE, THE IDEA BEHIND THE TRAINING OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT AGENTS WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT EXPLORATION STRATEGIES, IS THAT AS THEIR NEEDS EVOLVE DURING THE EXPLORATION SESSIONS,
utt_0125 utt 707.71 713.63 -X THE USERS CAN OPTIMIZE THEIR GUIDANCE BY ALWAYS SELECTING THE MOST SUITED MODEL.
utt_0126 utt 713.76 721.15 -X IN DORA THE USER INTERACTION CONSISTS IN OPPORTUNISTIC MODEL AND OPERATOR SELECTIONS.
utt_0127 utt 721.15 724.10 -X LET'S SEE WHAT IT MEANS IN ACTION.
utt_0128 utt 724.25 728.00 -X SO TO BEGIN WITH, WE HAVE TO SELECT AN EXPLORATION MODE.
utt_0129 utt 728.00 730.82 -X WE OFFER THREE DIFFERENT EXPLORATION MODES.
utt_0130 utt 730.82 734.43 -X IN THE MANUAL MODE, THE USER DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY KIND OF GUIDANCE.
utt_0131 utt 734.68 746.75 -X IN THE PARTIALLY GUIDED MODE, THE MODEL SUGGESTS WE OPERATE OR TO EXECUTE, SELECTS THE INPUT SET AND THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE OPERATOR, BUT THE USER CAN DECIDE TO IGNORE THE SUGGESTION.
utt_0133 utt 746.75 754.43 -X IN THE FULLY GUIDED MODE, THE MODEL DECIDES EVERY ASPECT OF THE EXPLORATION AND THE USER CAN ONLY START OR STOP THE EXPLORATION.
utt_0135 utt 754.43 756.13 -X LET'S START WITH PARTIALLY GUIDED MODE.
utt_0136 utt 756.89 762.40 -X THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE GUIDANCE WE HAVE TO SELECT IS THE MODEL THAT WILL BE USED FOR THE GUIDANCE.
utt_0138 utt 764.48 769.22 -X THE USER HAS TO SELECT THE TARGET SET THAT WAS USED FOR THE TRAINING OF THE MODEL,
utt_0139 utt 769.22 772.13 -X BETWEEN THE SCATTERED OR CONCENTRATED TARGET SETS,
utt_0140 utt 772.13 779.62 -X AND THE WEIGHT THAT WAS USED FOR THE CURIOSITY REWARD DURING THE TRAINING OF THE MODEL.
utt_0141 utt 779.62 781.25 -X IT'S A VALUE BETWEEN zero AND one.
utt_0142 utt 781.85 787.20 -X SO LET'S START WITH THE SIMPLE SCATTERED TARGET SET AND NO CURIOSITY MODEL.
utt_0143 utt 788.54 791.49 -X LET'S EXECUTE THE FIRST OPERATOR.
utt_0144 utt 796.96 808.48 -X SO HERE WE SEE THAT THE ITEM SET THAT WAS SELECTED BY THE MODEL IS AN ITEM SET COMPOSED OF VERY DIM AND DARK GALAXIES.
utt_0146 utt 808.86 820.29 -X WE ARE MORE INTERESTED INTO BRIGHT GALAXIES, SO WE WILL CHANGE THE EXPLORATION TO THAT, AND WE CAN ALSO DECIDE TO DO THE FIRST FACET ON THE REDSHIFT.
utt_0148 utt 820.29 822.43 -X LET'S EXECUTE IT
utt_0149 utt 827.23 831.14 -X SO NOW WE ARE PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE SELECTION OF THE MODEL,
utt_0150 utt 831.14 835.20 -X AND SINCE THE OBJECTIVE IS MOSTLY TO SHOW YOU HOW THE GUIDANCE WORKS,
utt_0151 utt 835.20 841.63 -X WE CAN SHIFT THE EXPLORATION MODE TO FULLY GUIDED, AND LET THE MODEL DECIDE THE EXPLORATION.
utt_0152 utt 841.63 842.93 -X SO WE START THE EXPLORATION
utt_0153 utt 844.77 854.79 -X AND NOW AT EACH STEP WE SEE THAT THE MODEL PICKS THE INPUT SET AND THE NEXT OPERATION.
utt_0154 utt 857.82 864.23 -X NOW AT ANY TIME THE USER CAN STOP THE EXPLORATION AND DECIDE TO CHANGE THE MODEL THAT'S USED FOR GUIDANCE.
utt_0156 utt 864.25 869.09 -X LET'S PICK ONE WITH A LITTLE CURIOSITY. WE DECIDE TO LOAD THE MODEL,
utt_0157 utt 871.23 875.09 -X AND WE SEE THAT THE INPUT SET AND THE NEXT OPERATION
utt_0158 utt 876.29 881.60 -X THAT WAS PICKED BY THIS MODEL IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONES FROM THE PREVIOUS MODEL.
utt_0159 utt 881.60 884.61 -X AT ANY TIME A USER CAN ALSO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD,
utt_0160 utt 884.80 890.75 -X AND SEE THE TRAINING INFORMATION OF THE MODEL IT'S BEEN USING FOR GUIDANCE.
utt_0161 utt 890.75 898.31 -X HERE WE SEE THE LEVEL OF FAMILIARITY AND CURIOSITY THAT WAS OBTAINED BY THE MODEL DURING THE TRAINING, AND THE GLOBAL REWARD.
utt_0163 utt 898.56 902.66 -X WE CAN ALSO SEE THE STRATEGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE
utt_0164 utt 902.85 908.64 -X MODEL DURING THE TRAINING, AS WE CAN SEE THE TYPES OF OPERATORS THAT WAS PICKED BY THE MODEL.
utt_0165 utt 909.41 914.69 -X SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE APPLICATION AND LET'S START THE EXPLORATION WITH THIS MODEL
utt_0166 utt 920.13 933.57 -X HERE THE MODELS ARE PRETTY CLOSE, THERE'S VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE TRAINING SO THEIR STRATEGIES ARE QUITE SIMILAR.
utt_0168 utt 933.57 938.79 -X HERE WE HAVE INTERESTING GALAXIES THAT ARE CIGAR SHAPED.
utt_0169 utt 939.39 944.93 -X THOSE ARE SPIRAL GALAXIES THAT ARE SEEN FROM THE SIDE, SO THEY LOOK LIKE LINES.
utt_0170 utt 945.06 952.07 -X SO WE CAN DECIDE TO HAVE A LOCAL EXPLORATION OF THIS AREA BY PICKING THE CONCENTRATED TARGET SETS.
utt_0171 utt 952.93 957.54 -X WE LOAD THE SET AND WE START THE EXPLORATION AGAIN.
utt_0172 utt 962.43 965.60 -X DUE TO THE WAY THE MODEL WAS TRAINED
utt_0173 utt 966.18 971.68 -X WITH A CONCENTRATED TARGET SET, AND A CHANGE OF TARGET SET AT EACH EPISODE,
utt_0174 utt 971.68 985.61 -X THESE MODELS ARE LOOKING FOR SIMILAR GALAXIES IN THE SURROUNDINGS OF THE LOCAL EXPLORATION AREA.
utt_0175 utt 985.79 991.05 -X WE CAN NOTICE THAT THIS MODEL IS MAKING A MUCH HEAVIER USE OF THE BY-NEIGHBORS OPERATOR,
utt_0176 utt 991.14 994.95 -X ALLOWING A GRADUAL EXPLORATION OF THE SURROUNDINGS.
utt_0177 utt 997.51 1003.56 -X NOW WE CAN DECIDE THAT WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH ON THIS LOCAL EXPLORATION, AND GO BACK TO THE
utt_0178 utt 1004.29 1005.67 -X SCATTERED EXPLORATION.
utt_0179 utt 1007.23 1019.72 -X WE WILL ALSO ADD A LITTLE MORE CURIOSITY TO GET AN EVEN MORE ADVENTUROUS EXPLORATION.
utt_0180 utt 1019.72 1025.32 -X HERE IN THE CURRENT PIPELINE AREA YOU CAN SEE FOR EACH OPERATOR THAT HAS BEEN EXECUTED,
utt_0181 utt 1025.32 1030.89 -X THE LEVEL OF FAMILIARITY AND CURIOSITY THAT WAS OBTAINED BY THIS OPERATION.
utt_0182 utt 1034.56 1037.80 -X YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS
utt_0183 utt 1038.34 1045.25 -X STEP OF EXPLORATION BROUGHT A LOT OF FAMILIARITY REWARD, SINCE MANY OF THESE ITEMS SHOWED ARE
utt_0184 utt 1045.60 1050.89 -X OF INTEREST FOR US, AND WERE PROBABLY IN THE CLASSIFICATION FROM THE GALAXY ZOO.
utt_0185 utt 1056.74 1059.65 -X THIS WAS THE DEMONSTRATION OF DORA THE EXPLORER.
utt_0186 utt 1059.65 1074.50 -X IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MORE INFORMATION, WE HAVE PUBLISHED ANOTHER PAPER AT THE AIDM WORKSHOP OF THE SIGMOD two thousand and twenty-one CONFERENCE, WHICH IS CALLED BALANCING FAMILIARITY AND CURIOSITY IN DATA EXPLORATION WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING.
utt_0189 utt 1074.50 1078.89 -X IN THIS PAPER WE ARE FOCUSING MORE ON THE TRAINING OF THE DIFFERENT MODELS,
utt_0190 utt 1078.98 1084.65 -X ON THE IMPACT OF THE OPERATORS, AND ON THE BALANCE OF FAMILIARITY AND CURIOSITY.
utt_0191 utt 1085.00 1090.34 -X WE HAD QUITE A FEW INTERESTING RESULTS, AS THE FACT THAT, ALTHOUGH IT'S WORKING FOR GAMES,
utt_0192 utt 1090.34 1094.86 -X CURIOSITY BY ITSELF DOES NOT REALLY WORK FOR EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS,
utt_0193 utt 1095.49 1101.99 -X BUT THAT THE BEST PERFORMING MODELS WERE THE ONES WITH LITTLE AMOUNTS OF CURIOSITY.
utt_0194 utt 1102.02 1109.61 -X WE HAVE QUITE A FEW POSSIBLE FUTURE WORKS, LIKE THE SCALING AND TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DATA WE EXPLORE,
utt_0196 utt 1109.61 1124.49 -X TO EXPLOIT THE USER FEEDBACK TO OPTIMIZE THE GUIDANCE, AND TO STUDY ALTERNATIVE REWARD METHODS THAT ARE NOT LIMITED LIKE FAMILIARITY TO THE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE DATASET WE EXPLORE.
utt_0198 utt 1125.83 1131.85 -X DORA THE EXPLORER IS AVAILABLE ONLINE, AND YOU CAN GET THE CODE FREELY ON GITHUB.
utt_0199 utt 1131.85 1132.68 -4.0266 THANK YOU FOR LISTENING!
