utt_0000 utt 1.00 3.89 -X HELLO. I AM GLAD TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW WORK:
utt_0001 utt 3.89 8.50 -X MARCHING-PRIMITIVES SHAPE ABSTRACTION FROM SIGNED DISTANCE FUNCTION.
utt_0002 utt 10.60 16.43 -X REPRESENTING COMPLEX OBJECTS WITH BASIC GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVES HAS LONG BEEN A TOPIC IN COMPUTER VISION.
utt_0003 utt 16.56 27.06 -X PRIMITIVE-BASED REPRESENTATIONS HAVE THE MERITS OF COMPACTNESS AND COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN HIGHER-LEVEL TASKS SUCH AS PHYSICS SIMULATION, COLLISION CHECKING, AND ROBOTIC MANIPULATION.
utt_0005 utt 27.34 31.47 -X UNLIKE PREVIOUS WORKS WHICH EXTRACT MESHES FROM A SIGNED DISTANCE FUNCTION (SDF)
utt_0006 utt 31.47 38.35 -X WE PRESENT A NOVEL METHOD, NAMED MARCHING PRIMITIVES, TO OBTAIN A PRIMITIVE-BASED ABSTRACTION DIRECTLY FROM AN SDF.
utt_0007 utt 38.99 44.98 -X IN THIS PAPER WE FOCUS ON A VERSATILE GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE CALLED SUPERQUADRICS TO REPRESENT SCENES.
utt_0008 utt 45.04 49.33 -X A SUPERQUADRIC WITH A GENERAL POSE IS ONLY ENCODED BY eleven PARAMETERS.
utt_0009 utt 49.39 61.72 -X MORE IMPORTANTLY, SUPERQUADRICS HAVE CLOSED FORM MINKOWSKI-SUM, MAKING IT AN EFFICIENT REPRESENTATION FOR COLLISION DETECTION AND MOTION PLANNING.
utt_0010 utt 61.72 67.83 -X OUR GOAL IS TO APPROXIMATE A TARGET SHAPE ENCODED IN A SDF WITH A COMBINATION OF GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVES.
utt_0011 utt 68.21 71.38 -X TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, WE NEED TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS:
utt_0012 utt 71.54 76.05 -X WHAT IS THE SET OF VOXELS WHERE GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVES CAN BE EXTRACTED?
utt_0013 utt 76.11 79.99 -X AND WHAT GEOMETRY BEST FIT THE UNDERLYING SET OF VOXELS?
utt_0014 utt 80.24 82.52 -X THIS IS A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM.
utt_0015 utt 82.52 86.58 -X THE ANSWER TO EITHER OF THE PROBLEMS WILL LEAD TO THE ANSWER TO THE OTHER ONE.
utt_0016 utt 86.87 90.74 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE KNOW THE PARAMETER OF A GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE,
utt_0017 utt 90.74 94.20 -X WE ARE READY TO TELL ITS CORRESPONDING UNDERLYING VOXELS.
utt_0018 utt 94.20 99.86 -X SIMILARLY, IF WE ARE GIVEN A SET OF VOXELS WHICH ENCODES A GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE,
utt_0019 utt 99.89 106.90 -X WE CAN EASILY SOLVE THE PARAMETER WITH THE LEAST SQUARE METHOD.
utt_0020 utt 106.90 110.62 -X TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A two-STEP PROBABILISTIC APPROACH.
utt_0021 utt 110.71 115.19 -X FOR BETTER ILLUSTRATION, WE USE A twoD CASE AS AN EXAMPLE.
utt_0022 utt 115.19 120.02 -X FIRST, WE CHECK THE CONNECTIVITY OF VOXELS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SIGNED DISTANCES.
utt_0023 utt 120.56 122.14 -X GIVEN THE TARGET SDF,
utt_0024 utt 122.23 129.94 -X OUR ALGORITHM CHECKS THE CONNECTIVITY OF VOXELS WHOSE SIGNED DISTANCE IS LESS THAN A SEQUENCE OF THRESHOLDS.
utt_0025 utt 129.94 133.30 -X EACH THRESHOLD DEFINES A SET OF DISJOINT ISOSURFACES,
utt_0026 utt 133.36 138.71 -X ENCOMPASSING THE CONNECTED VOXELS WHOSE SIGNED DISTANCES ARE LESS THAN THE THRESHOLD.
utt_0027 utt 139.03 143.39 -X WE START FROM THE INNERMOST SIGNED DISTANCE AND CONTINUE MARCHING ON THE SEQUENCE
utt_0028 utt 143.48 148.03 -X UNTIL A REGION WHICH IS LARGE ENOUGH TO EXTRACT GEOMETRIC INFORMATION APPEARS.
utt_0029 utt 148.44 153.47 -X EACH OF THE CONNECTED REGIONS IS AN IDEAL STARTING POINT FOR GROWING A PRIMITIVE.
utt_0030 utt 153.78 155.55 -X THIS IS BECAUSE:
utt_0031 utt 155.55 168.86 -X (one) THOSE VOLUMES ARE AMONG THE MOST INTERIOR OF THE TARGET SDF, CORRESPONDING TO MOST PROMINENT PART OF THE GEOMETRY (two) DISCONNECTED AND WEAKLY CONNECTED VOLUMES CAN BE SEPARATED APART
utt_0033 utt 170.04 175.04 -X (three) THE SDF OF A PRIMITIVE CAN ALSO BE INTERPRETED AS LAYERS OF ISOSURFACES,
utt_0034 utt 175.10 178.33 -X AND THUS SHARING SIMILAR GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE
utt_0035 utt 178.42 187.68 -X AND FURTHERMORE, THE SIZE OF THE VOLUMES IS LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT GEOMETRIC INFORMATION FOR THE PRIMITIVE RECOVERY.
utt_0036 utt 189.02 194.94 -X NEXT, FOR EACH OF THE VOLUME OF INTEREST, WE INITIALIZE A GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE AS A CIRCLE.
utt_0037 utt 195.19 201.82 -X WE MARCH ON THE SCOPE OF VOXELS FROM WHICH A PRIMITIVE IS ABLE TO BE EXTRACTED IN A PROBABILISTIC SENSE
utt_0038 utt 202.04 207.84 -X AND SIMULTANEOUSLY SOLVE FOR THE PARAMETERS OF THE PRIMITIVE TO CAPTURE THE UNDERLYING LOCAL GEOMETRY.
utt_0039 utt 208.06 215.33 -X THAT IS, WE MODEL THE SIGNED DISTANCES OF VOXELS AS OBSERVATIONS GENERATED FROM A PROBABILISTIC DISTRIBUTION.
utt_0040 utt 215.96 222.11 -X A VOXEL CAN EITHER CONTRIBUTE TO THE CURRENT GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE OR BE DISCARDED AS AN OUTLIER.
utt_0041 utt 222.39 225.06 -X GIVEN THE CURRENT ESTIMATION OF THE PRIMITIVE,
utt_0042 utt 225.12 235.01 -X WE ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THE PROBABILISTIC CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN THE VOXELS AND THE GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE FROM A POSTERIOR PERSPECTIVE VIA THE BAYES RULE.
utt_0044 utt 235.01 242.72 -X AND THEN, THE PARAMETERS OF THE GEOMETRIC PRIMITIVE IS UPDATED ACCORDING TO THE ESTIMATED PROBABILISTIC CORRESPONDENCES.
utt_0045 utt 242.97 248.42 -X THE TWO STEPS ALTERNATE UNTIL CONVERGENCE, SIMILAR TO THE EM ALGORITHM.
utt_0046 utt 252.41 257.47 -X WE CAN SEE THAT THE UPPER HALF OF THE HUMAN SHAPE IS CAPTURED IN THE FIRST ROUND.
utt_0047 utt 257.98 262.47 -X AGAIN, WE CONDUCT THE CONNECTIVITY MARCHING ON THE REMAINING REGION.
utt_0048 utt 265.12 271.46 -X THEN, A PRIMITIVE IS INITIALIZED AND MARCHES TO CAPTURE THE SHAPE THE RIGHT LEG.
utt_0049 utt 274.27 279.46 -X FINALLY, THE REGION AND SHAPE OF THE LEFT LEG IS DETECTED AND RECOVERED.
utt_0050 utt 286.21 292.13 -X COMBINING ALL THE PRIMITIVES, WE ARE ABLE TO APPROXIMATE THE TARGET SHAPE ACCURATELY.
utt_0051 utt 294.18 296.80 -X HERE IS THE VISUALIZATION OF A threeD CASE.
utt_0052 utt 297.34 301.92 -X THE POSE AND SHAPE OF THE CHAIR IS APPROXIMATED WITH ONLY eighteen SUPERQUADRICS,
utt_0053 utt 302.85 308.10 -X WHICH CAN BE FULLY REPRESENTED WITH VERY FEW NUMBERS AS SHOWN ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE.
utt_0054 utt 308.10 311.40 -X THE ABSTRACTION ONLY OCCUPIES LESS THAN one KB.
utt_0055 utt 319.91 323.40 -X WE EVALUATE OUR ALGORITHM ON THE SHAPENET DATASET.
utt_0056 utt 323.94 328.77 -X OUR ALGORITHM IS ABLE TO DESCRIBE OBJECTS ACCURATELY WITHOUT TRAINING,
utt_0057 utt 328.77 333.35 -X , AND IS INHERENTLY GENERALIZABLE AMONG DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.
utt_0058 utt 335.94 340.17 -X OUR METHOD ACHIEVES THE STATE OF THE ART IN SHAPE ABSTRACTION,
utt_0059 utt 340.42 347.53 -X OUTPERFORMING THE EXISTING METHODS BY A LARGE MARGIN.
utt_0060 utt 347.53 352.97 -X OUR METHOD CAN SUCCESSFULLY SEPARATE DIFFERENT PARTS IF THEY POSSESS DIFFERENT GEOMETRIC SEMANTICS
utt_0061 utt 353.19 357.48 -X FOR EXAMPLE, TELLING APART CUBOIDS, CYLINDERS, AND ELLIPSOIDS.
utt_0062 utt 357.99 361.19 -X THEREFORE, IT IS SEMANTICALLY INTERPRETABLE.
utt_0063 utt 361.19 365.93 -X IN MANY CASES THE SEGMENTATION COINCIDES WITH THE HUMAN-DEFINED SEMANTICS,
utt_0064 utt 366.12 368.62 -X EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT TRAINED TO.
utt_0065 utt 372.29 376.52 -X HERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES OF OUR PRIMITIVE BASED ABSTRACTIONS
utt_0066 utt 376.55 381.96 -X COMPARING WITH THE MESHES GENERATED FROM THE SAME SDF WITH MARCHING CUBES.
utt_0067 utt 382.34 384.65 -X OUR REPRESENTATION IS COMPACT,
utt_0068 utt 385.35 387.88 -X ABOUT one thousand TIMES SMALLER THAN THE MESHES,
utt_0069 utt 387.91 392.49 -X BUT STILL CAPTURES THE KEY SHAPES OF THE OBJECTS VIVIDLY.
utt_0070 utt 468.14 469.87 -X OUR CODE IS OPEN-SOURCED,
