utt_0000 utt 0.22 11.31 -X HELLO, MY NAME IS KAYO YIN AND TODAY I WILL BE PRESENTING OUR WORK ON SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION. TO BEGIN, COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IS THE TASK OF
utt_0002 utt 11.31 22.10 -X IDENTIFYING ALL REFERENCES TO THE SAME ENTITY IN THE DISCOURSE. SO IN THIS EXAMPLE, WE HAVE I AND ME THAT REFER TO ONE ENTITY, ALICE AND SHE TO ANOTHER, AND BOB AND HE TO A THIRD ENTITY.
utt_0004 utt 22.86 32.66 -X COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF NATURAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING AND HIGHER-LEVEL NLP APPLICATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION EXTRACTION, TEXT SUMMARIZATION, AND MACHINE TRANSLATION.
utt_0006 utt 33.81 38.19 -X YET, THIS TASK IS COMPLETELY UNEXPLORED FOR SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0007 utt 38.19 42.51 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE WILL EXPLORE THE TASK OF COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IN SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0008 utt 44.01 57.17 -X I WILL BEGIN BY PRESENTING HOW COREFERENCE IS ESTABLISHED IN SIGNED LANGUAGES THROUGH PRONOMINAL POINTING SIGNS. SIGN LINGUISTS GENERALLY RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNS THAT SERVE A FUNCTION SIMILAR TO THAT OF PRONOUNS. IN VARIOUS SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0011 utt 57.77 61.27 -X REFERENTS OF PRONOMINAL SIGNS ARE OFTEN ESTABLISHED IN THE SIGNING SPACE,
utt_0012 utt 61.27 65.23 -X WHICH IS THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE IN FRONT OF THE SIGNER THAT IS USED TO PRODUCE SIGNS.
utt_0013 utt 66.29 74.96 -X WHEN USING PRONOMINAL POINTING SIGNS, THE SIGNER CAN POINT TO THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE REFERENT IF THE REFERENT IS IN THE SAME ROOM FOR EXAMPLE, SUCH AS TOWARDS THEMSELVES FOR I,
utt_0015 utt 74.96 79.89 -X TOWARDS THE ADDRESSEE FOR YOU, OR TOWARDS AN ENTITY IN THE SAME ROOM FOR HE, SHE, THEY, IT.
utt_0016 utt 81.17 90.39 -X FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT PRESENT, THE SIGNER CAN ASSIGN A PARTICULAR POINT IN THE SIGNING SPACE TO THE ENTITY, THEN POINT TO THIS POINT FOR ALL SUBSEQUENT MENTIONS OF THE ENTITY.
utt_0018 utt 90.54 93.49 -X WE CALL THESE POINTS IN THE SIGNING SPACE A LOCUS.
utt_0019 utt 94.74 105.08 -X TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, THE TWO CHARACTERS ALICE AND BOB ARE INTRODUCED BY FINGERSPELLING THEIR NAMES ON THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SIGNER RESPECTIVELY. THEN, INSTEAD OF FINGERSPELLING
utt_0021 utt 105.08 115.06 -X THEIR NAMES EACH TIME THE SIGNER REFERS TO THE CHARACTERS AGAIN, THE SIGNER CAN SIMPLY POINT TO THE LOCUS ASSIGNED TO THE CHARACTER, WHICH CAN SAVE THE SIGNER A LOT OF TIME. THIS IS SIMILAR
utt_0023 utt 115.06 120.24 -X TO HOW SHE AND HE CAN BE USED IN ENGLISH TO REFER TO ALICE AND BOB, BUT IN SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0024 utt 120.24 124.63 -X THE VISUAL SPACE IS HEAVILY EXPLOITED TO MAKE THE REFERENCING CLEAR. AS A RESULT,
utt_0025 utt 124.63 129.62 -X THE MEANING OF PRONOMINAL POINTING SIGNS IS NOT STABLE AND IT HIGHLY DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT,
utt_0026 utt 129.62 135.70 -X AND THEREFORE COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE ANTECEDENT OF THESE SIGNS.
utt_0027 utt 135.70 145.27 -X TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF POINTING SIGNS, WE CAN ALSO TRY TO COMPARE POINTING SIGNS TO PRONOUNS IN SPOKEN LANGUAGES. FOR INSTANCE, IN ENGLISH, PRONOUNS SUCH AS HE, SHE,
utt_0029 utt 146.07 156.57 -X THEY CARRY SOME MEANING ON THEIR OWN: REMOVED FROM CONTEXT, WE CAN STILL INFER THE GENDER OR THE NUMBER OF THE REFERENT. HOWEVER, PRONOMINAL POINTING SIGNS HAVE THE SAME FEATURES OF HANDSHAPE
utt_0031 utt 156.57 161.46 -X WHEN THEY ARE REMOVED FROM CONTEXT, SO WE CANNOT INFER ANYTHING ABOUT THE REFERENTS OF THESE SIGNS.
utt_0032 utt 162.77 168.28 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, WHILE THE SAME PRONOUN CAN REFER TO TWO OR MORE DISTINCT ENTITIES AT ONCE,
utt_0033 utt 168.91 180.60 -X SO IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE TWO PRONOUNS SHE REFERS TO SEPARATE ENTITIES BUT USING THE CONTEXT WE CAN INFER THAT THE FIRST SHE REFERS TO THE MOTHER AND THE SECOND TO ALICE, IN SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0035 utt 180.60 191.45 -X A GIVEN LOCUS REFERS TO AT MOST ONE REFERENT AT A TIME. BUT THIS STILL COMES WITH OTHER COMPLEXITIES BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL, THE SAME LOCUS CAN BE REASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT ENTITIES DURING THE
utt_0037 utt 191.45 204.66 -X DISCOURSE. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE MIGHT HAVE THIS LOCUS THAT REFERS TO ALICE AT FIRST, BUT THEN THE SIGNER CAN REASSIGN THIS LOCUS TO BOB LATER BY FIRST SIGNING HIS NAME THEN POINTING TO THIS LOCATION.
utt_0039 utt 204.66 209.34 -X A SIGNED ENTITY CAN ALSO BE ASSIGNED ONE LOCUS TO ANOTHER DURING A GIVEN DISCOURSE.
utt_0040 utt 209.40 214.58 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF BOB IS AT THE STORE AND THE STORE IS ASSIGNED A LOCUS ON MY RIGHT,
utt_0041 utt 214.58 225.24 -X BUT THEN BOB RETURNS HOME WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO A LOCUS ON MY LEFT, THE LOCUS FOR BOB ALSO CHANGES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. THEREFORE, MODELS MUST BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE LONG-TERM DEPENDENCIES
utt_0043 utt 225.24 229.86 -X TO BE ABLE TO DETECT AND KEEP TRACK OF WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN ENTITY-LOCUS ASSIGNMENT
utt_0044 utt 231.61 245.37 -X WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING BECAUSE SOME THEORIES OF COREFERENCE AND SPOKEN LANGUAGES MAY BE EXTENDED TO SIGNED LANGUAGES. THIS FURTHER MOTIVATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF LINGUISTICALLY-INFORMED
utt_0047 utt 245.37 250.23 -X NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING MODELS FOR CHALLENGES IN PROCESSING SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0048 utt 250.23 260.79 -X ANOTHER MOTIVATION IS THAT SIGNED LANGUAGES CAN ALSO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO PROCESS MULTI-MODAL COMMUNICATION IN GENERAL. FOR EXAMPLE, ICONICITY CAN SOMETIMES PLAY AN
utt_0050 utt 260.79 275.13 -X IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SPATIAL GRAMMAR OF SIGNED LANGUAGES. LOCI IN SIGNED LANGUAGES CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY HAVE A GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION, SUCH AS PRONOUNS, BUT ALSO A LOGICAL FUNCTION WHERE SOME OF THE GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF SIGNS IN SIGNING SPACE CAN REFLECT THOSE IN REAL LIFE.
utt_0053 utt 275.13 287.26 -X THEREFORE, STUDYING THE INTEGRATION OF ICONICITY AND SITUATED REFERENCE IN SIGNED COMMUNICATION WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO PROCESS GROUNDING IN SPOKEN LANGUAGES AS WELL.
utt_0055 utt 287.32 299.13 -X WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR US AS NLP RESEARCHERS TO ENSURE THAT LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITIES,
utt_0057 utt 299.16 308.25 -X AND SOLVING COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PROVIDE HIGHER APPLICATIONS OF SIGNED LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES.
utt_0059 utt 308.25 318.84 -X I WILL NOW PRESENT SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION AS A NOVEL CHALLENGE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. WE FORMALIZE SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION BY DECOMPOSING IT INTO TWO
utt_0061 utt 318.84 329.12 -X TASKS. FIRST, WE HAVE MENTION DETECTION. WE'RE GIVEN A VIDEO OF A PERSON SIGNING, THEN WE EXTRACT ALL MENTIONS IN THE VIDEO, THAT IS THE SIGNS OR THE GROUP OF SIGNS IN THE VIDEO THAT
utt_0063 utt 329.12 340.99 -X REFER TO SOME ENTITY. NEXT, WE PERFORM COREFERENCE RESOLUTION OVER THE MENTIONS. AFTER OBTAINING THE SET OF MENTIONS, WE THEN IDENTIFY THE COREFERENCE ASSIGNMENT OF EACH MENTION, WHERE ALL MENTIONS
utt_0065 utt 340.99 351.84 -X REFERRING TO THE SAME ENTITY ARE ASSIGNED THE SAME COREFERENCE LABEL. SINCE THIS IS A NOVEL CHALLENGE, WE DEVELOP A SMALL DATASET OF A SIGNED LANGUAGE WITH GOLD COREFERENCE LABELS
utt_0067 utt 351.84 363.68 -X TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE OUR MODELS. WE BASE OUR DATASET ON THE EXISTING PUBLIC DGS CORPUS, WHICH IS A DATASET OF fifty HOURS OF ANNOTATED DIALOGUE BETWEEN NATIVE SIGNERS OF GERMAN SIGN LANGUAGE.
utt_0069 utt 365.63 378.08 -X SINCE THE PUBLIC DGS CORPUS DOES NOT CONTAIN EXPLICIT ANNOTATION FOR COREFERENCE, WE ALSO HIRED ANNOTATORS TO ENHANCE THE GLOSS ANNOTATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC DGS CORPUS TO CONSTRUCT OUR DATASET.
utt_0071 utt 378.68 388.62 -X TO DO SO, WE DEVELOPED AN ANNOTATION INTERFACE OF COREFERENCE RESOLUTION FOR SIGNED LANGUAGES WHICH IS PICTURED HERE. THE ANNOTATORS CAN SUBMIT THEIR ANNOTATIONS
utt_0073 utt 388.62 393.89 -X BY HIGHLIGHTING ALL GLOSSES SHOWN THAT REFER TO THE SAME ENTITY AS THE UNDERLINED POINTING GLOSS
utt_0074 utt 395.77 406.53 -X WE PUBLICLY RELEASED THE DGS-COREF DATASET WHICH IS A SUBSET OF THE PUBLIC DGS CORPUS THAT HAS BEEN ENHANCED WITH ANNOTATIONS FOR PRONOMINAL INDEXING COREFERENCE.
utt_0076 utt 406.53 410.34 -X DGS-COREFCOMPRISES sixteen MINUTES AND thirty SECONDS OF SIGNING
utt_0077 utt 413.53 420.86 -X AND two hundred and eighty-eight SIGNED SENTENCES WITH one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six TOTAL GLASSES INCLUDING one hundred and ninety-six DIFFERENT POINTING SIGNS.
utt_0078 utt 420.86 426.88 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE GLOSSES AND TRANSLATION ARE FROM THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC DGS CORPUS,
utt_0079 utt 426.88 431.87 -X THEN DGS-COREF HAS THE ADDITIONAL ANNOTATION THAT THE TWO INDEX SIGNS ARE COREFERENT.
utt_0080 utt 433.66 439.84 -X NOW, I WILL PRESENT THE UNSUPERVISED MODEL WE PROPOSE FOR SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION.
utt_0081 utt 439.84 443.81 -X IN OUR APPROACH, WE MODEL THE DOCUMENT AS A DIRECT LABELED WEIGHTED MULTIGRAPH,
utt_0082 utt 443.81 446.05 -X WHERE THE GLOSS TOKENS ARE THE NODES OF THE GRAPH.
utt_0083 utt 447.55 451.59 -X THEN, WE CONSTRUCT EDGES BETWEEN MENTIONS IF TWO MENTIONS VERIFY A RELATION,
utt_0084 utt 451.61 458.66 -X AND THEN WE ASSIGN DIFFERENT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE WEIGHTS TO THESE EDGES DEPENDING ON THE RELATION.
utt_0085 utt 458.66 467.20 -X THEN, CLUSTERING IS APPLIED TO THE RESULTING MULTIGRAPH TO OBTAIN THE ENTITY GROUPS CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENT, WHERE NODES WITH DEGREE ZERO IN THE GRAPH ARE NON-MENTIONS.
utt_0087 utt 468.45 478.66 -X WE PROPOSE SIX HEURISTICS AS POSITIVE RELATIONS THAT INDICATE CO-REFERENCE. FIRST, THE I AND I HEURISTIC IS WHEN THE TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER AND POINT TO THE SIGNER'S CHEST.
utt_0089 utt 479.90 489.86 -X THEN, YOU AND YOU, THE TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER AND POINT AWAY FROM THE SIGNER'S BODY TOWARDS THE OTHER. I AND YOU WHERE THE TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT SIGNERS,
utt_0091 utt 489.86 493.44 -X ONE POINTS TO THE SIGNER'S CHEST AND THE OTHER POINTS AWAY FROM THE SIGNER.
utt_0092 utt 494.78 507.80 -X TEMPORALLY CLOSE INDEX WHERE THE TWO SIGNS ARE INDEXING SIGNS PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER AND THEY HAVE LESS THAN ten SIGNS BETWEEN THEM. NOUN PHRASE THIS IS WHEN AN INDEXING SIGN HAS NO
utt_0094 utt 507.80 518.92 -X OTHER INDEXING SIGNS WITHIN THE PREVIOUS ten SIGNS AND THEN THIS IS INDICATED AS MAYBE CO-REFERENT TO THE TEMPORARILY CLOSEST PREVIOUS SIGN THAT IS NOT A VERB PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER.
utt_0096 utt 518.92 532.16 -X THEN, WE HAVE SPATIALLY CLOSE INDEX, WHERE THE TWO SIGNS ARE INDEXING SIGNS PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER AND THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LOCATIONS OF PRODUCTION IS LESS THAN fifty PIXELS.
utt_0098 utt 532.35 545.96 -X WE ALSO ADD FOUR CONSTRAINTS TO COREFERENCE AS NEGATIVE RELATIONS, WHERE WE RULE OUT TWO MENTIONS FOR COREFERENCE IF THEY HAVE ANY OF THESE NEGATIVE RELATIONS. FIRST, THE NEGATIVE I AND I IS WHEN TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT SIGNERS BUT EACH POINT OF THE SIGNER'S CHEST.
utt_0101 utt 546.66 551.21 -X YOU AND YOU WHERE THE TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT SIGNERS AND POINT TO THE ADDRESSEE.
utt_0102 utt 552.10 565.54 -X I AND YOU WITH THE TWO SIGNS ARE PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER, BUT ONE TO THE SIGNER'S CHEST AND THE OTHER POINTS AWAY FROM THE SIGNER'S BODY, AND THEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT PERSON WHERE ONE SIGN EITHER POINTS TOWARDS THE SIGNER'S CHEST OR TOWARDS THE ADDRESSEE,
utt_0105 utt 565.54 569.25 -X AND THE OTHER SIGN THAT IS SIGNED BY THE SAME PERSON POINTS TO A THIRD PERSON.
utt_0106 utt 571.36 580.77 -X WE HAVE SPATIALLY FAR INDEX WHERE THE TWO SIGNS ARE INDEXING SIGNS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY THE SAME SIGNER BUT THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO LOCI OF PRODUCTION IS GREATER THAN one hundred PIXELS.
utt_0108 utt 582.95 588.17 -X NOW, I WILL DESCRIBE HOW WE ASSIGN WEIGHTS TO THE GRAPH EDGES DEPENDING ON EACH RELATION.
utt_0109 utt 588.17 598.12 -X FOR ALL NEGATIVE RELATIONS, WE ASSIGN THE WEIGHTS NEGATIVE INFINITY AS THEY ARE HARD CONSTRAINTS FOR COREFERENCE. FOR BINARY POSITIVE RELATIONS, WE ASSIGN A FIXED WEIGHT OF zero point five.
utt_0111 utt 599.40 611.24 -X THEN FOR THE TEMPORARY CLOSE AND THE NOUN PHRASE RELATIONS THAT DEPEND ON THE TEMPORAL PROXIMITY OF THE SIGNS, IF THE TWO SIGNS HAVE T SIGNS BETWEEN THEM, WHERE T IS LESS THAN ten, THEN THE ASSIGNED
utt_0113 utt 611.24 624.04 -X WEIGHT IS ten MINUS T OVER twenty. FOR SPATIALLY CLOSE INDEX, IF THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SIGNS IS S, WHERE S IS LESS THAN fifty THEN THE ASSIGNED WEIGHT IS fifty MINUS S OVER fifty.
utt_0115 utt 626.05 631.43 -X WE APPLY ONE-NEAREST NEIGHBOR CLUSTERING ON THE OBTAINED MULTIGRAPH TO IDENTIFY THE CORRECT SIGNS.
utt_0116 utt 631.68 641.58 -X FOR EVERY SIGN, IT IS A MENTION IF IT HAS AT LEAST EDGES TO ANOTHER SIGN WHERE THE SUM OF THE EDGES IS STRICTLY POSITIVE. THEN, THIS SIGN IS COREFERENT TO THE SIGN WHOSE SUM OF EDGE WEIGHTS
utt_0118 utt 641.58 647.95 -X IS MAXIMAL. FINALLY, I WILL DISCUSS THE RESULTS OF OUR MODEL ON SIGNED COREFERENCE RESOLUTION.
utt_0119 utt 648.71 653.64 -X WE EVALUATE OUR SYSTEM ON COMMONLY USED METRICS FOR COREFERENCE RESOLUTION IN SPOKEN LANGUAGES
utt_0120 utt 655.08 661.32 -X AND WE ACHIEVE A MEAN Fone OF fifty point five four ACROSS ALL INDEXING SIGNS. OVERALL, WE ACHIEVE A HIGH MEAN
utt_0121 utt 662.18 666.76 -X OF ninety-two point two ON I AND YOU SIGNS WHICH IS EXPECTED, AS THEY CONTAIN LOW AMBIGUITY IN MEANING.
utt_0122 utt 667.69 674.89 -X ON INDEX SIGNS WHERE THE MODEL MUST KEEP TRACK OF SPATIAL COHERENCE AND DISCOURSE AND RESOLVE DIFFERENT LOCI, WE ACHIEVE twenty-six point nine MEAN Fone WHICH SHOWS THAT
utt_0124 utt 675.72 680.36 -X THERE IS STILL MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT TO DISAMBIGUATE THIRD)PERSON INDEXING SIGNS.
utt_0125 utt 680.42 685.61 -X OUR PAPER ALSO CONTAINS QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES OF WHAT OUR MODELS ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR NOT.
utt_0126 utt 686.73 700.62 -X TO SUMMARIZE, OUR PAPER PRESENTS A NEW CHALLENGE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING CALLED SIGN COREFERENCE RESOLUTION. WE RELEASE AN ANNOTATION SOFTWARE AND A NEW DATASET OF COREFERENCE IN GERMAN SIGN LANGUAGE. THEN, WE PROPOSE AN UNSUPERVISED CONTINUOUS MULTIGRAPH
utt_0129 utt 700.62 705.71 -X MODEL WITH A SET OF SIGN LINGUISTICS-INFORMED HEURISTICS TO PERFORM SIGN COREFERENCE RESOLUTION
utt_0130 utt 706.63 714.44 -X OUR CODE AND DATA IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO HELP UNDERPIN FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS TASK AND FURTHER TASKS IN SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!
