utt_0000 utt 0.18 3.60 -X GOOD DAY EVERYONE. MY NAME IS KARN WATCHARASUPAT.
utt_0001 utt 3.88 14.42 -X I AM CURRENTLY A PENULTIMATE YEAR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT STUDYING ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING AT THE NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY, SINGAPORE.
utt_0003 utt 14.42 19.06 -X MY RESEARCH AREAS ARE IN SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR MUSIC AND AUDIO APPLICATIONS.
utt_0004 utt 28.40 36.21 -X TODAY, ON BEHALF OF MY CO-AUTHORS, ANH, CHING HUI, AND PROF ANDY, I WILL BE PRESENTING OUR PAPER
utt_0005 utt 36.30 43.70 -X DIRECTIONAL SPARSE FILTERING USING WEIGHTED LEHMER MEAN FOR BLIND SEPARATION OF UNBALANCED SPEECH MIXTURES.
utt_0007 utt 46.09 50.99 -X BEFORE WE GET STARTED, LET ME INTRODUCE THE PROBLEM OF BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION.
utt_0008 utt 51.28 63.54 -X BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION, OR BSS FOR SHORTS, IS A PROBLEM OF EXTRACTING INDIVIDUAL SOURCE SIGNALS FROM THEIR MIXTURE. THE WORD 'BLIND' SUGGESTS THAT WE HAVE LITTLE TO NO INFORMATION ABOUT
utt_0010 utt 63.54 75.06 -X THE SETUP AND THE SOURCES. THE PROBLEM WE ARE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS UNDERDETERMINED BSS, WHICH IS WHEN WE HAVE MORE SOURCES THAN THE NUMBER OF SENSORS OR MICROPHONES.
utt_0012 utt 75.70 81.88 -X IN THE TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN, THE TRANSFER FUNCTIONS FROM THE SOURCES TO THE SENSOR ARRAY ARE
utt_0013 utt 82.22 94.00 -X COLLECTIVELY KNOWN IN BSS AS THE MIXING MATRIX. ONE POPULAR FORMULATION OF BSS AS AN UNSUPERVISED METHOD IS TO ESTIMATE THE MIXING MATRIX AS A LATENT VARIABLE.
utt_0015 utt 94.03 105.01 -X ONCE THE MIXING MATRIX IS ESTIMATED, THE PROBLEM OF SOURCE EXTRACTION IS GENERALLY SIMPLER. IN THE UNDERDETERMINED CASE, TIME-FREQUENCY MASKING IS ONE SUCH METHOD.
utt_0017 utt 109.84 122.01 -X THE APPROACH WE ARE PRESENTING IN THIS WORK IS AN EXTENSION OF THE DIRECTIONAL SPARSE FILTERING FRAMEWORK OR DSF. DSF WAS FIRST INTRODUCED IN ICASSP two thousand and seventeen BY MY CO-AUTHOR, ANH.
utt_0019 utt 124.34 135.93 -X DSF IS AN UNDERDETERMINED BSS METHOD WHICH WORKS ON SIGNALS RETRIEVED BY A MULTICHANNEL MICROPHONE ARRAY. IT IS UNSUPERVISED WHICH MEANS THAT, UNLIKE DEEP LEARNING-BASED METHODS,
utt_0021 utt 135.93 140.76 -X IT REQUIRES NO PRE-TRAINING, ALLOWING IT TO WORK IN MANY UNSEEN SETUPS.
utt_0022 utt 141.33 146.26 -X DSF USES SOFT CLUSTERING OF DIRECTIONAL INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE THE MIXING MATRIX,
utt_0023 utt 146.32 152.22 -X HENCE IT REQUIRES A MULTICHANNEL SENSOR ARRAY AS A DATA ACQUISITION TOOL.
utt_0024 utt 153.81 159.80 -X THE CENTRAL ASSUMPTION OF DSF IS BASED ON THE DISJOINT-ORTHOGONALITY OF SPEECH SIGNALS.
utt_0025 utt 159.89 172.70 -X SPEECH SIGNAL TENDS TO BE SPARSE IN THE TF DOMAIN WHICH MEANS THAT, AT EACH TF BIN, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MIXTURE IS ONLY DOMINATED BY ONE SOURCE EVEN IF THE SOURCES ARE OVERLAPPING IN TIME.
utt_0027 utt 172.85 184.86 -X THIS MEANS THAT AT EACH TIME-FREQUENCY BIN, OUR MIXTURE SIGNAL VECTOR, X, IS SIMPLY A COMPLEX SCALAR MULTIPLE OF THE COLUMN OF THE MIXING MATRIX, H_N, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOMINANT SOURCE.
utt_0029 utt 184.86 197.69 -X SINCE THE SOURCE SIGNAL, S_N, AT THE TF BIN IS JUST A COMPLEX SCALAR, IN THE COMPLEX VECTOR SPACE AS SEEN HERE, THIS MEANS THAT THE HERMITIAN ANGLE BETWEEN THE TWO VECTORS IS CLOSE TO ZERO.
utt_0031 utt 198.01 210.12 -X HENCE, THE COSINE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO VECTORS IS ALSO CLOSE TO UNITY. BY CLUSTERING THE MIXTURE SIGNAL VECTORS ACROSS ALL FRAMES IN EACH FREQUENCY BIN, THE COLUMNS OF THE MIXING
utt_0033 utt 210.12 221.40 -X MATRIX IN EACH FREQUENCY BIN CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE CENTROIDS OF THESE CLUSTERS. THE PHASE INVARIANT COSINE DISTANCE SHOWN HERE IS A NATURAL CHOICE AS A DISTANCE MATRIX.
utt_0035 utt 225.27 230.91 -X AN IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE IS THAT DSF DOES NOT PERFORM HARD ALLOCATION OF CLUSTERS,
utt_0036 utt 231.00 241.88 -X BUT RATHER IT EMULATES THE DIRECTIONAL CLUSTERING BEHAVIOR BY USING THE SOFT MINIMUM FUNCTION TO AGGREGATE THE DISTANCES BETWEEN EACH TF MIXTURE VECTOR AND THE CENTROIDS.
utt_0038 utt 243.19 248.51 -X THE ORIGINAL DSF USES THE POWER MEAN SHOWN HERE AS THE SOFT MINIMUM FUNCTION
utt_0039 utt 248.54 261.25 -X AND PERFORMS AVERAGING OVER EACH FRAME TO FORM THE COST FUNCTION SHOWN HERE. HOWEVER, THE POWER MEAN HAS SOME INHERENT DISADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO SPEECH SEPARATION. DUE TO THE NATURE
utt_0041 utt 261.25 266.33 -X OF SPEECH SIGNALS, EACH SPEAKER WILL TEND TO OCCUPY SOME FREQUENCY BINS MORE THAN THE OTHERS.
utt_0042 utt 266.33 271.97 -X THIS MEANS THAT THE FRAME DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOURCES IN EACH FREQUENCY BINS ARE OFTEN UNBALANCED.
utt_0043 utt 272.09 283.33 -X SINCE THE POWER MEAN DOES NOT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT, SOME COLUMNS OF THE MIXING MATRIX MAY BE SUBOPTIMALLY LEARNED IF THE CORRESPONDING SOURCE IS UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THAT FREQUENCY BIN.
utt_0045 utt 287.19 298.66 -X AS A RESULT, WE SEEK ANOTHER SOFT MINIMUM FUNCTION WHICH CAN DO THE JOB BETTER. ONE SUCH FUNCTION IS THE LEHMER MEAN SHOWN HERE. BY INTRODUCING A LEARNABLE WEIGHT,
utt_0047 utt 298.91 310.82 -X W, INTO THE SOFT MINIMUM FUNCTION, THE ALGORITHM CAN AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATE FOR THE SOURCE IMBALANCES DURING OPTIMIZATION. MOREOVER, THE LEHMER MEAN SATISFIES SOME PROPERTIES WHICH ARE
utt_0049 utt 310.82 323.26 -X DESIRABLE AS A SOFT MINIMUM FUNCTION FOR DSF. JUST LIKE THE POWER MEAN, THE LEHMER MEAN DECREASES WHEN THE SMALLEST COSINE DISTANCE DECREASES. WHEN ONE OF THE DISTANCES APPROACHES ZERO,
utt_0051 utt 323.26 329.57 -X LEHMER MEAN ALLOWS DSF TO BEHAVE SIMILARLY TO DIRECTIONAL CLUSTERING. MOREOVER,
utt_0052 utt 329.57 341.25 -X WHENEVER ONE OF THE DISTANCES IS ZERO, THE LEHMER MEAN ITSELF TAKES THE VALUE ZERO. THIS ENSURES THAT SINGLE SOURCE FRAMES ARE TREATED EQUALLY AND ARE NOT PENALIZED IN ANY WAY IN THE COST FUNCTION.
utt_0054 utt 343.45 348.42 -X THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THE LEHMER MEAN MAY NOTICE THAT THE LEHMER MEAN FUNCTION INTRODUCED EARLIER
utt_0055 utt 348.45 353.01 -X IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL DEFINITION. THE LEHMER MEAN USED IN
utt_0057 utt 361.63 366.59 -X RECALL THAT EARLIER WE NEED THE WEIGHTS TO ADAPTIVELY COMPENSATE FOR SOURCE IMBALANCES.
utt_0058 utt 366.78 371.72 -X HOWEVER, THE USUAL WEIGHTED LEHMER MEANS RUNS THE RISK OF WEIGHT DEGENERATION.
utt_0059 utt 371.74 377.09 -X THAT IS, SOME WEIGHTS MAY OR DEGENERATE TO ZERO AS WE MINIMIZE THE COST FUNCTION HERE.
utt_0060 utt 377.31 386.72 -X AS SUCH, WE USE ADDITIVE SMOOTHING, ALPHA, ON THE WEIGHT TO ENFORCE SOME MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL DISTANCES TO THE COST FUNCTION AT EACH TF BIN.
utt_0062 utt 389.47 400.77 -X MOREOVER, LEHMER MEAN ALSO HAS SOME ADDITIONAL DESIRABLE PROPERTIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO LEARN WITH GRADIENT-BASED OPTIMIZATION. THE [WEIGHTED] LEHMER MEAN HAS WEIGHT SELF-NORMALIZATION,
utt_0064 utt 400.86 406.37 -X MEANING THE WEIGHTS NEED NOT SUM TO ONE, UNLIKE THE WEIGHTED VERSION OF POWER MEAN.
utt_0065 utt 406.37 411.11 -X THIS GREATLY SIMPLIFIES THE GRADIENT CALCULATION ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE WEIGHTS.
utt_0066 utt 411.33 415.46 -X FROM OUR EXPERIENCE, EVEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS TO OPTIMIZE.
utt_0067 utt 415.46 421.01 -X LEHMER MEAN VERSION OF DSF CONVERGES PRACTICALLY AS FAST AS THE POWER MEAN DSF.
utt_0068 utt 425.63 430.69 -X NOW THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM WE WILL BE COMPARING DSF-WLM,
utt_0069 utt 431.39 446.09 -X WHICH IS THE DSF BY WEIGHTED LEHMER MEAN WE ARE PROPOSING, TO OTHER SIMILAR BSS ALGORITHMS. OF COURSE, ONE OF THEM IS THE ORIGINAL DSF BY POWER MEAN, DSF-PM, AND WE WILL ALSO BE COMPARING OUR
utt_0071 utt 446.09 452.58 -X PROPOSED METHOD WITH ACGMM WHICH USES THE GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE TIME-FREQUENCY MASK.
utt_0072 utt 453.44 465.70 -X OUR SETUP IS SHOWN HERE. WE RECORD twelve SPEECH [SOURCE IMAGES] USING CONCATENATED UTTERANCES FROM THE TIMIT DATASET, IN THREE REAL ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENTS, [EACH AT ONE OF THE twelve] DIFFERENT LOCATIONS
utt_0074 utt 465.70 476.30 -X SHOWN IN THE PLOT HERE. THE SOURCE IMAGE RECORDING WAS DONE USING A MOBILE PHONE WITH TWO BUILT-IN MICROPHONES. WE LATER SUPERPOSED THE SOURCE IMAGES TO CREATE A MIXTURE
utt_0076 utt 476.30 481.10 -X WITH RANDOM ATTENUATION OF UP TO twelve DB ON ALL BUT ONE SOURCE IMAGES.
utt_0077 utt 484.58 490.95 -X THE METRICS WE'LL BE USING TO EVALUATE OUR ALGORITHM ARE SDR, OR SOURCE-TO-DISTORTION RATIO,
utt_0078 utt 490.95 504.71 -X WHICH IS A STANDARD METRIC FOR BSS, AS WELL AS THE EXTENDED SHORT-TIME OBJECTIVE INTELLIGIBILITY MEASURE, OR ESTOI. AS ITS NAME SUGGESTS, ESTOI ESTIMATES HOW INTELLIGIBLE THE
utt_0080 utt 504.71 510.09 -X EXTRACTED SOURCE SIGNALS ARE, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO KNOW WHEN WORKING WITH SPEECH SIGNALS.
utt_0081 utt 512.20 526.00 -X BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE MAIN RESULT, I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE HYPERPARAMETER R IN THE LEHMER MEAN IS QUITE IMPORTANT. WE FIX IT AT zero point five ACROSS ALL ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENTS LATER ON FOR FAIRNESS.
utt_0083 utt 526.98 532.75 -X HOWEVER, IN PRACTICE, R SHOULD ACTUALLY BE OPTIMIZED FOR EACH ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0084 utt 532.90 536.11 -X FROM OUR EXPERIMENT IN THE HOLD-OUT ENVIRONMENT,
utt_0085 utt 536.65 542.03 -X R CLOSER TO ONE GIVES US A MORE CONSISTENT RESULT, BUT LOWER MEDIAN PERFORMANCES
utt_0087 utt 547.98 560.08 -X NOW, BACK TO OUR MAIN EXPERIMENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, DSF-WLM GENERALLY PERFORMS BETTER THAN BOTH DSF-PM
utt_0088 utt 560.78 565.04 -X AND ACGMM IN THE OFFICE AND LECTURE THEATER ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0089 utt 565.87 579.84 -X THE TUTORIAL ROOM ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY SEE THE DSF-PM PERFORMING SLIGHTLY BETTER IN TERMS OF MEDIAN PERFORMANCE, ALTHOUGH OVERALL IT IS QUITE A SIMILAR PERFORMANCE TO DSF-WLM. WE BELIEVE THIS
utt_0091 utt 579.84 585.58 -X COULD ALSO BE DUE TO THE SUBOPTIMAL VALUE OF R EQUAL TO zero point five THAT WE FIX ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0092 utt 586.28 598.86 -X IN CONCLUSION, IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE AN EXTENSION OF THE DSF ALGORITHM USING THE WEIGHTED LEHMER MEAN. THE WEIGHTED LEHMER MEAN VERSION OF DSF USES LEARNABLE WEIGHTS IN THE SOFT
utt_0094 utt 598.86 612.05 -X MINIMUM FUNCTION TO ACCOUNT FOR SOURCE IMBALANCES. DSF-WLM HAS RELATIVELY SIMPLE GRADIENTS AND REQUIRE A MINIMAL INCREASE IN COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY COMPARED TO DSF-PM DESPITE THE LARGER
utt_0096 utt 612.52 619.02 -X NUMBER OF PARAMETERS TO BE OPTIMIZED. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION ALSO SHOWS MODEST IMPROVEMENT
utt_0097 utt 619.12 627.44 -X FROM DSF-PM AND IN FACT, [DSF-WLM] OUTPERFORMED ACGMM QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY. MOST IMPORTANTLY,
utt_0098 utt 627.44 639.18 -X THIS PAPER ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE GENERALIZABILITY OF THE DSF AS A BSS FRAMEWORK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MORE WORKS ADAPTING THIS FRAMEWORK FOR OTHER NOVEL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF BSS.
utt_0100 utt 639.18 651.79 -X THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING, AND WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AND HAVING FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS AT THE LIVE POSTER PRESENTATION SESSION.
utt_0102 utt 653.04 657.11 -5.4480 OUR PAPER NUMBER IS one thousand, four hundred and ten AND WE HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE. THANK YOU!
