utt_0000 utt 0.30 14.58 -X HELLO EVERYBODY! WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT MRAT, THE MIXED REALITY ANALYTICS TOOLKIT AND SO THIS IS WORK DONE WITH A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES AND STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. I'M MICHAEL NEBELING. I'M SHWETHA RAJARAM. RIGHT, SO WE'RE TWO OF
utt_0003 utt 14.58 24.91 -X THE AUTHORS ON THIS WORK AND THIS WORK STARTED ACTUALLY A LONG TIME AGO AT MICHIGAN INVOLVING MAXIMILIAN SPEICHER IN PARTICULAR. AND SO THIS WORK STARTED
utt_0005 utt 24.91 36.18 -X OUT WITH THIS VISION AND ALSO QUESTION: WHAT IF WE WANTED TO DO USER STUDIES IN MIXED REALITY FOR EXAMPLE INVOLVING DEVICES LIKE HOLOLENS, AND WE
utt_0007 utt 36.20 42.39 -X HAD THIS IDEA OF BRINGING IN LOTS OF EASY WAYS OF CONSTRUCTING USER STUDIES,
utt_0008 utt 42.39 51.89 -X WE HAD THIS IDEA OF BRINGING PHYSICAL MARKERS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GUIDE PARTICIPANTS THROUGH TASKS, AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE CAN SEE THESE MARKERS AS
utt_0010 utt 51.89 57.49 -X WELL IN HOLOLENS AND WE CAN RECOGNIZE WHICH TASKS PARTICIPANTS ARE WORKING ON,
utt_0011 utt 57.49 70.48 -X WE CAN ESTABLISH METRICS WHETHER THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT. SO THOSE ARE THE KEY IDEAS BEHIND THIS WORK AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS PAPER SPECIFICALLY ARE THIS REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION THAT WE CONDUCTED WITH eight UNIVERSITY RESEARCH,
utt_0014 utt 70.48 79.52 -X INSTRUCTIONAL, AND MEDIA TEAMS, ALL WORKING ON XR PROJECTS. WE PRESENT THE DESIGN OF THE TOOLKIT – WE WANTED IT TO BE AS GENERIC AS POSSIBLE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT
utt_0016 utt 79.53 84.34 -X MRAT CAN ACTUALLY BE USED ON A NUMBER OF EXISTING MR APPS. WE WANTED
utt_0017 utt 84.81 91.15 -X THE SYSTEM TO BE FLEXIBLE AND EASY FOR USERS, INCLUDING RESEARCHERS LIKE US, TO
utt_0018 utt 91.31 102.55 -X DEFINE TASKS AND METRICS FOR DATA COLLECTION. WE ALSO WANTED TO SUPPORT THE USAGE OF HOLOLENS FOR EXAMPLE THE DEVICE WE'RE ACTUALLY USING TO COLLECT DATA, BUT WE
utt_0020 utt 102.55 106.58 -X ALSO FELT LIKE WE NEEDED PART OF THE INTERFACE TO BE RUN ON A SECOND DEVICE,
utt_0021 utt 106.58 115.71 -X SO THERE'S A TABLET THAT WE'LL SHOW LATER HELPS YOU DURING DATA ANALYSIS TASKS AND VISUALIZATION TASKS. THE PAPER ALSO
utt_0024 utt 118.45 128.74 -X THE PAPER, IS THE MRAT-CRISIS CASE STUDY. SO WE REALLY WANTED TO TEST OUT OUR TOOLKIT, AND LET'S SAY WE HAD THIS CHALLENGE WITH PUBLISHING THIS TOOLKIT
utt_0026 utt 128.74 141.97 -X AND SO WE ADDED THIS CASE STUDY THAT NOW SHOWS HOW WE COULD USE MRAT AND OTHER RESEARCHERS COULD USE MRAT TO DESIGN A MIXED REALITY WORLD AND MAYBE DO OPTIMIZATIONS AROUND IT. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THIS FOR A SPECIFIC
utt_0029 utt 141.97 155.60 -X CRISIS SIMULATION CLASS EXERCISE, WE TRANSFORMED A PHYSICAL CLASSROOM INTO A MIXED REALITY EXPERIENCE. WE SHOW AS I SAID HOW MRAT SUPPORTED PERFORMANCE TUNING AND DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. OKAY IF YOU LOOK AT RELATED WORK,
utt_0032 utt 155.60 169.27 -X THERE IS A LOT OF WORK IN THE TOOLKITS SPACE THAT MRAT ADDS TO. SO PREVIOUS TOOLKITS WERE INITIALLY FOCUSED AROUND WEB AND THEN MOBILE AND TOUCH AND MULTI-TOUCH, AND THEN THERE WAS A STREAM OF RESEARCH AROUND KINECT. SO HERE WE
utt_0035 utt 169.27 178.68 -X PICKED TWO EXAMPLES FROM THAT STREAM OF RESEARCH SO CHRONOVIS AND KINECT ANALYSIS ARE BOTH TOOLS THAT ALLOW EXPERIMENTERS TO COLLECT DATA WITH THESE
utt_0037 utt 178.77 189.52 -X MORE ADVANCED SENSORS THAN JUST CAMERAS, AND THEY SUPPORT TASKS THAT GO BEYOND VIDEO ANALYSIS. SO IN CHRONOVIS YOU WERE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ANNOTATE AND WELL
utt_0039 utt 189.52 197.14 -X ANALYZE MULTIPLE STREAMS OF DATA. KINECT ANALYSIS WAS VERY FOCUSED ON KINECT, SO YOU HAD SKELETAL DATA, RGB DATA,
utt_0041 utt 197.17 206.90 -X AND SPEECH COMMANDS. AND SO THESE TOOLS WERE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT EVALUATORS, OFTEN COLLECTING ESSENTIALLY DATA AROUND HOW
utt_0043 utt 206.90 217.57 -X USERS OPERATE INTERFACES, AND WE WANTED MRAT TO BE SUCH A SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN COLLECT SIMILAR DATA AND VISUALIZE IT IN SIMILAR WAYS, WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT
utt_0045 utt 217.57 231.65 -X MIXED REALITY, SO BOTH VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENTED REALITY, INTERFACES AND APPS BEING USED. SO A LOT OF RESEARCHERS CURRENTLY HAVE TO BUILD THESE TOOLS THEMSELVES HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE THAT SHWETHA IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT. ANOTHER AREA
utt_0048 utt 231.65 235.67 -X OF RESEARCH THAT WE LOOKED INTO WAS TRAINING SIMULATIONS. SO, IN THIS EXAMPLE,
utt_0049 utt 236.24 245.85 -X THE RESEARCH TEAM CREATED A TRIAGE TRAINING SYSTEM THAT HELPS PARTICIPANTS TRACK THEIR PROGRESS. SO THEY GOT A VISUALIZATION OF THEIR RESULTS AT THE
utt_0051 utt 246.29 250.29 -X END WITH HOW MANY LABELS THEY GOT CORRECT FOR THE TRIAGING COMPONENT.
utt_0052 utt 250.45 257.78 -X SO WE SEE IN A LOT OF THESE WORKS THAT RESEARCHERS ARE CREATING THEIR OWN SYSTEMS OF DATA COLLECTION, SO ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS THAT WE CREATED MRAT
utt_0055 utt 267.19 271.16 -X BE A GENERIC TOOL. SO THE WAY WE WENT ABOUT IT WAS TALKING TO eight RESEARCH, MEDIA, AND
utt_0057 utt 274.58 286.07 -X ON A VARIETY OF XR PROJECTS. SO WE FOUND THAT IN PARTICULAR THERE IS A NEED BEYOND USABILITY TESTING. A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS THEY HAD, WHAT THEY WANTED TO FIND OUT BY DOING STUDIES IN MIXED REALITY, WERE NOT
utt_0060 utt 286.68 296.68 -X WHETHER THIS INTERFACE IS USABLE, OR WHETHER THIS BUTTON IS SIZED THE RIGHT WAY. SO THE QUESTIONS WERE OFTEN MORE ABOUT USER BEHAVIOR, ABOUT OTHER
utt_0062 utt 296.76 310.78 -X MORE RELEVANT QUESTIONS FOR VR REGARDING PRESENCE AND IMMERSION. THERE WAS A STRONG NEED FOR BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND SPATIAL DATA, SO TIME ON TASK OBVIOUSLY, BUT ALSO LIKE HOW PEOPLE NAVIGATE A SCENE, WHERE THEY SPEND MOST
utt_0065 utt 310.78 325.32 -X OF THE TIME, WHAT THEY LOOK AT, IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO COLLECT THIS DATA. THE RESEARCH TEAMS HAD REALLY DIVERSE REQUIREMENTS REGARDING INTERACTIONS, BOTH GESTURE AND SPEECH, BUT SOMETIMES ALSO JUST MOSTLY IMPLICIT: CAMERA BASED INTERACTIONS, ALSO
utt_0068 utt 325.32 338.17 -X MARKER BASED INTERACTIONS WERE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO A LOT OF RESEARCH TEAMS. SO MRAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT EACH OF THESE AND MAKE IT VERY FLEXIBLE. WHAT WE ALSO FOUND WAS THAT THERE WAS REALLY A NEED FOR BEING ABLE
utt_0071 utt 338.17 350.10 -X TO FLEXIBLY DEFINE TASKS, SO WHAT A GRANULARITY OR A UNIT OF A TASK WAS VERY DIFFERENT BETWEEN TEAMS, AND THE TEAMS WERE ALSO EXPERIMENTING A LOT WITH THEIR STUDY DESIGNS. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO PROGRAM A LOT TO BE ABLE TO
utt_0074 utt 350.10 354.26 -X DEFINE TASKS SO WE HAD TO PAY ATTENTION IN MRAT TO MAKE THAT EASY FOR THEM.
utt_0075 utt 354.26 365.05 -X AND THEN THE LAST IMPORTANT FINDING FROM OUR INTERVIEWS WAS THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR METRICS, BUT NOT REALLY COMMONLY AGREED ON METRICS OTHER THAN TIME ON
utt_0077 utt 365.05 377.31 -X TASKS, THAT WOULD HELP ASSESS PERFORMANCE OF USERS. SO MRAT SHOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO COLLECT A LOT OF DATA, AND THEN BASED ON THE DATA, SPECIFIC TO EACH
utt_0079 utt 377.31 387.03 -X PROJECT, THE RESEARCHERS WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DEFINE THEIR OWN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. AND, I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE RELATIVELY GOOD SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST
utt_0081 utt 387.06 400.70 -X FOUR REQUIREMENTS, AND THERE IS MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE LAST REQUIREMENT, BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT. ALL RIGHT AND HERE IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WOULD SEE WHEN YOU TRY OUT MRAT, A DASHBOARD
utt_0084 utt 400.70 406.11 -X THAT SHOWS ALL THE DATA THAT CAN BE COLLECTED. SHWETHA, GIVE US A QUICK RUNDOWN.
utt_0085 utt 407.03 415.87 -X SURE, SO FIRST ON THE LEFT (NUMBER ONE) YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT USERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LOGGING DATA TO THE SYSTEM, DIFFERENT MODES OF THE APPLICATION. SO
utt_0087 utt 416.02 423.96 -X FOR OUR CASE STUDY WE HAD A TRAINING MODE, AND THEN WHEN THE SIMULATION STARTED WE HAD DIFFERENT MODES AS WELL. THERE'S ALSO A LIST OF ALL OF THE EVENTS
utt_0089 utt 424.18 437.69 -X THAT ARE BEING TRACKED AT THE MOMENT, AND YOU CAN TOGGLE THEM ON AND OFF TO SIMPLIFY THE VIEW OF THE DASHBOARD. AND THEN (NUMBER TWO) IF YOU HOVER OVER AN EVENT WITH YOUR MOUSE OR CLICK ON IT ON A TABLET, YOU CAN SEE SOME MORE
utt_0092 utt 437.81 443.52 -X DETAILS. SO FOR THIS THIS EVENT WE HAVE A PHOTO THAT WAS SENT THROUGH THE MESSAGE, WE CAN SEE
utt_0093 utt 443.70 452.99 -X WHICH USER SENT THE MESSAGE, WE CAN SEE THE TIME THAT IT TOOK PLACE AS WELL. AND THEN (THREE) ON THE RIGHT SIDE, WE HAVE A SPATIAL LAYOUT OF THE ENTIRE ROOM SO YOU
utt_0095 utt 453.78 467.84 -X CAN SEE WHERE THE PARTICIPANTS MOVED DURING OUR STUDY, YOU CAN SEE OTHER OBJECTS THAT ARE BEING TRACKED SUCH AS A TIMER AND WINDOWS IN THE ROOM. WE ALSO HAVE THIS SUPPORT FOR ACTUALLY VISUALIZING THE DATA IN MIXED REALITY, AND THAT'S
utt_0098 utt 467.84 476.97 -X SOMETHING WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON OPTIMIZING AND GETTING IT TO WORK ON HOLOLENS. SO HERE WE'LL SEE A LITTLE VIDEO OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. SO THIS IS A
utt_0100 utt 476.98 491.31 -X FIRST-PERSON VIEW –- YOU SEE A LOT OF DATA THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED. THIS IS FROM OUR MRAT-CRISIS TEST RUN, SO NOT THE ACTUAL STUDY, BUT SOME TEST RUNS IN THE LAB. AND THEN, YOU ARE ABLE TO INSPECT THAT DATA IN SITU, SO YOU CAN
utt_0103 utt 491.31 503.20 -X ACTUALLY GO BACK, WE USE THE TABLET HERE AS A DEVICE FOR FILTERING, BUT YOU CAN STILL INTERACT WITH THE DATA USING HOLOLENS. SO WE HAVE SOME INTERACTIVE CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES THAT MAKE SURE THAT NOT ALL THE EVENTS ARE VISIBLE ALL THE
utt_0106 utt 503.20 516.65 -X TIME. AND WE CAN REALLY NAVIGATE AND FILTER THE DATA BASED ON INTERACTIONS ON THE TABLET, WHICH WE SHOW HERE, BUT ALSO JUST YOU WALKING IN THAT ROOM REALLY DETERMINES WHICH EVENTS ARE ACTUALLY VISIBLE OR NOT. SO WE HAVE STEP BY STEP
utt_0109 utt 516.65 530.59 -X PLAYBACK, A COUPLE OF BASIC INTERACTIONS: WE HAVE EVENT BASED FILTERING, SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC EVENT, SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN INJURIES OCCUR, WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT LATER, WHERE THEY OCCURRED, WHO WAS INJURED, WHERE PEOPLE WERE IN THE
utt_0112 utt 530.59 539.39 -X ROOM AT THE TIME – YOU CAN DO THESE KINDS OF SPATIAL QUERIES. SO ONE OF THE YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE A LOT BUT WE DON'T SHOW IN THIS VIDEO IS HOW YOU USE MRAT.
utt_0114 utt 539.39 543.87 -X SO MRAT IS IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW ON TOP OF UNITY, A LOT OF THE COMPONENTS OF MRAT.
utt_0115 utt 544.12 558.70 -X SO WE PROVIDE VARIOUS EDITORS THAT ALLOW YOU TO CONFIGURE TASKS RELATIVELY FLEXIBLY AND QUICKLY, WITHOUT PROGRAMMING, BUT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF UNITY. OKAY LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE MRAT-CRISIS
utt_0118 utt 558.70 568.61 -X CASE STUDY THAT'S REALLY A BIG PART OF THE PAPER. SO OUR CASE STUDY WAS DESIGNED FOR A CRISIS INFORMATICS COURSE HERE AT THE SCHOOL OF INFORMATION FOR MASTER
utt_0120 utt 569.56 575.90 -X STUDENTS, AND A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS COURSE IS COMPLETING A COLLABORATIVE LAB AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE SEMESTER,
utt_0122 utt 576.83 590.40 -X WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN A CRISIS SITUATION. SO IN THIS CASE THEY WERE IN A SAFE HOUSE DURING A CIVIL WAR, AND THEIR OBJECT WAS TO SURVEY THE SITUATION TO SEE WHAT SUPPLIES THEY HAD, TO TREAT ANYONE THAT GOT INJURED WITHIN
utt_0125 utt 590.40 595.34 -X THE SIMULATION, AND ALSO SEND A RUNNER TO A REMOTE HEADQUARTERS LOCATION WHEN IT
utt_0126 utt 595.71 609.57 -X WAS SAFE DURING THE SIMULATION. SO THIS IS OUR FLOOR PLAN THAT WE MADE AFTER ACTUALLY OBSERVING THE SIMULATION RUN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SEMESTER. WE ALSO WENT THROUGH THIS TRIAGE TRAINING EXERCISE, HERE YOU SEE SOME MEMBERS
utt_0129 utt 609.57 620.35 -X OF OUR RESEARCH TEAM. WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS A PROFESSIONAL IN NURSING, AND WE WERE RUNNING THROUGH THIS TRIAGE TRAINING EXERCISE USING LEGO FIGURES TO
utt_0131 utt 620.35 631.68 -X SIMULATE PATIENTS AND MAKING KEY DECISIONS HOW TO SOLVE A DISASTER, WHERE I THINK THERE WAS A TRAIN CRASH AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE INJURED. IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE FOR US AS A RESEARCH TEAM TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF
utt_0134 utt 632.89 647.01 -X CRISIS SIMULATION AND WHICH OF THESE COMPONENTS MIGHT TRANSLATE HOW TO MIXED REALITY. AND SO WE STARTED PROTOTYPING, AND SHWETHA IS GONNA WALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE FEATURES THAT CAME OUT IN THE END, BUT THIS IS A PRE-VIZ ESSENTIALLY OF
utt_0137 utt 647.01 657.38 -X WHAT WE WANTED TO DO. SO THIS IS THE ROOM IN WHICH OUR STUDY WILL TAKE PLACE. IT IS A SAFE HOUSE BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DESTROYED, IT'S IN THE WAR ZONE, THERE'S
utt_0139 utt 657.38 666.05 -X FIRE, ELECTRICITY THERE, PEOPLE GET INJURED. IT'S LIKE AN ESCAPE ROOM SIMULATION – YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO ACTUALLY LEAVE THAT ROOM.
utt_0141 utt 667.87 672.22 -X AND HERE IS THE UNITY VERSION OF THE MIXED REALITY APPLICATION. SO YOU CAN SEE
utt_0142 utt 674.56 682.02 -X THERE'S A TIMER ON THE WALL, THERE ARE SEVERAL WINDOWS AND YOU CAN SEE OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS TO SEE THE CIVIL WAR GOING ON. THERE ARE FEW DEAD BODIES IN THE ROOM
utt_0144 utt 683.33 687.46 -X TO KIND OF INCREASE THE ANXIETY I GUESS, OR THE STRESS OF THE SITUATION. AND
utt_0145 utt 688.25 693.12 -X THEN, HERE IS THE APPLICATION RUNNING ON THE HOLOLENS. SO WE SEE
utt_0146 utt 694.88 706.59 -X UNFORTUNATELY SOME DEAD PEOPLE IN OUR IN OUR ROOM USING HOLOLENS AND WE SHOW OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL. I GOT INJURED AND I THINK LUCY AND SHWETHA ARE
utt_0148 utt 706.59 715.75 -X TRYING TO TRIAGE ME. SO TRIAGING IS A SPECIFIC, FOLLOWS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL – AN ASSESSMENT THAT WE LEARNED ABOUT AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IN MIXED REALITY.
utt_0150 utt 716.38 721.09 -X RIGHT, THERE ARE PHONES IN THE SIMULATION AS WELL AND T-SHIRTS TO PROJECT WOUNDS.
utt_0151 utt 721.34 726.47 -X AND SO IT'S REALLY A COMPLEX LITTLE CASE STUDY THAT INVOLVE VARIOUS COMPONENTS,
utt_0152 utt 726.75 740.35 -X BUT THE PURPOSE, OR THE FOCUS OF THIS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER, IS REALLY THE USE OF MRAT THROUGHOUT THIS CASE STUDY. SO HERE YOU SEE THE USER STUDIES TAKING PLACE – YOU CAN'T SEE THE MIXED REALITY CONTENT, BUT THE PLAYERS ARE
utt_0155 utt 740.35 743.46 -X KIND OF SURVEYING THE ENVIRONMENT, THEY'RE SEEING THE WINDOWS, THEY'RE
utt_0156 utt 743.61 753.63 -X SEEING THE DEAD BODIES, THEY'RE KIND OF WARNING EACH OTHER TO STAY OUT OF DANGERS WAY. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE PERFORMING TRIAGE, COMPLETING THE INJURY TASKS,
utt_0158 utt 753.98 760.16 -X SENDING PICTURES AND MESSAGES WITH THE PLAYERS INJURIES. AND THROUGHOUT THIS
utt_0159 utt 760.54 763.94 -X ENTIRE TIME MRAT IS COLLECTING DATA ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE MOVING IN THE ROOM,
utt_0160 utt 763.94 767.97 -X THEY'RE COLLECTING NEW DATA ABOUT WHEN THE RUNNER LEFT THE ROOM. SO HERE'S
utt_0161 utt 768.00 781.25 -X ACTUALLY THE SESSION THAT WE RECORDED. SO ONE KEY ASPECT OF THE SIMULATION THAT WE WANTED TO IMPROVE USING MRAT WAS PERFORMANCE. WE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH FRAME RATE AT THE BEGINNING, WITH YOU KNOW LIKE THE EXPLOSIONS HAPPENING IN
utt_0164 utt 781.25 794.40 -X THE ROOM, SO WE USED MRAT TO TUNE PERFORMANCE AND KIND OF LEAD US TO THE DESIGN DECISION TO PUT A LOT OF THE VIRTUAL OBJECTS OUTSIDE OF WINDOWS WHERE THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE RENDERED. YES, AND THAT ALSO MAKES A LOT OF SENSE GIVEN THE
utt_0167 utt 794.40 803.20 -X SMALL FIELD OF VIEW OF A HOLOLENS. WE ALSO PLAYED AROUND WITH DIFFERENT T-SHIRT DESIGNS AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO KIND OF LIKE
utt_0169 utt 803.55 809.75 -X ACCURATELY, ANATOMICALLY ACCURATELY PLACE INJURIES, DIFFERENT TYPES OF INJURIES, AND
utt_0170 utt 809.98 824.98 -X SUPPORT THE TRIAGE TASKS. WE PLAYED AROUND A LOT WITH MARKER TRACKING PERFORMANCE – AND WE DISCUSSED THIS IN DETAIL IN THE PAPER AS WELL – DIFFERENT TYPES OF T-SHIRT DESIGNS, BLACK VERSUS WHITE, HOW DOES IT REACT TO LIGHT, AND WE
utt_0173 utt 824.98 835.75 -X CHECKED HOW WELL AND RELIABLE WOULD THE MARKER TRACKING WORK, USING A COMBINATION OF VUFORIA AND HOLOLENS. ALRIGHT, SO WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED WATCHING THIS VIDEO
utt_0175 utt 835.75 849.86 -X AND PLEASE READ THE PAPER! WE BELIEVE THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS PAPER WERE REALLY HOW WE APPROACHED THIS WHOLE TASK OF DESIGNING A TOOLKIT LIKE THAT, HOW WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS BY TALKING TO THESE DIVERSE
utt_0178 utt 850.15 864.09 -X TEAMS. WE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THE PAPER HOW WE DESIGN THE ANALYTICS PART OF THE TOOLKIT, SUPPORTING DATA COLLECTION DATA PLAYBACK USING THIS COMBINATION OF THE TABLET AND THE HOLOLENS, RATHER THAN DOING EVERYTHING IN
utt_0181 utt 864.09 876.71 -X MIXED REALITY – SO NO MINORITY REPORT FROM US! AND WE ALSO – THE PARTS THAT SHWETHA EXPANDED ON A LOT – WAS THIS CASE STUDY THAT REALLY SHOWED HOW WE COULD USE MRAT
utt_0183 utt 876.71 880.52 -X BOTH TO RUN USER STUDIES WITH IT, AND THEN ALSO TO OPTIMIZE THE EXPERIENCE.
utt_0184 utt 881.06 892.10 -X SO AGAIN THIS WAS THE MIXED REALITY ANALYTICS TOOLKIT, MRAT. IT INVOLVED A LOT OF STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR, SO THANKS TO ALL THESE GUYS. WE ALSO GOT A BEST PAPER ON
utt_0186 utt 892.10 896.33 -X THAT, SO WE'RE _VERY_ HAPPY AND WE'RE SO SAD WE COULDN'T SEE YOU GUYS AT CHI! AND
utt_0187 utt 896.35 899.91 -2.6639 IF ANYBODY WATCHES THIS VIDEO PLEASE DROP US A NOTE!
