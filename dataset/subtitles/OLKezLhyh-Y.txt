utt_0000 utt 0.34 13.49 -X HI, MY NAME IS VINCENT AND I AM FROM THE SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING LAB AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON. ON BEHALF OF CHRISTINE AND PATRICK MY CO-AUTHORS, I WILL BE PRESENTING
utt_0002 utt 13.49 20.24 -X OUR EUSIPCO PAPER TITLED SPEECH DEREVERBERATION OF A POLYNOMIAL EVD SUBSPACE APPROACH.
utt_0003 utt 22.16 28.59 -X THIS IS THE OUTLINE OF MY TALK TODAY.
utt_0004 utt 28.59 41.78 -X MANY APPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEARING AIDS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION (ASR) AND VOICE-CONTROLLED HOME SYSTEMS PERFORM WELL FOR CLEAN SPEECH SIGNALS.
utt_0006 utt 41.78 55.35 -X IN REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS, HOWEVER, THE SPEECH SIGNAL IS OFTEN DEGRADED BY BACKGROUND NOISE AND REVERBERATION, THEREBY, REDUCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS. THE PERFORMANCE
utt_0008 utt 55.35 60.82 -X CAN BE IMPROVED BY USING SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHMS TO PROCESS THE RECEIVED SIGNALS.
utt_0009 utt 62.00 70.03 -X BECAUSE PRIOR INFORMATION OF THE TARGET SPEECH OR THE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT ARE UNAVAILABLE,
utt_0010 utt 70.03 72.72 -X BLIND AND UNSUPERVISED APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED.
utt_0011 utt 75.50 82.39 -X THE SINGLE-CHANNEL AND MULTI-CHANNEL SUBSPACE APPROACHES FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT USE AN EVD
utt_0012 utt 82.90 85.36 -X TO DECORRELATE SPECTRALLY AND SPATIALLY.
utt_0013 utt 86.00 89.65 -X HOWEVER, AN EVD CAN ONLY DECORATE INSTANTANEOUSLY
utt_0014 utt 90.83 96.28 -X AND THIS IS INADEQUATE FOR SPEECH SIGNALS WHICH NATURALLY EXHIBITS TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS
utt_0015 utt 96.53 110.93 -X ACROSS DIFFERENT MICROPHONES. OTHER METHODS TYPICALLY USE THE SHORT-TIME FOURIER TRANSFORM TO PROCESS. IN THIS APPROACH, IT USES THE DFT TO DIVIDE THE BROADBAND SIGNALS INTO MULTIPLE NARROW-BANDS.
utt_0017 utt 112.37 120.60 -X HOWEVER, IT LACKS PHASE COHERENCE ACROSS BANDS AND IGNORES CORRELATION BETWEEN BANDS.
utt_0018 utt 120.62 133.65 -X TO CAPTURE THE SPACE, TIME AND FREQUENCY CORRELATIONS, POLYNOMIAL MATRICES ARE INTRODUCED AS AN APPROPRIATE MODEL. AND TO PROCESS THEM, POLYNOMIAL EVD IS USED TO IMPOSE SPATIAL
utt_0020 utt 133.65 142.74 -X DECORRELATION OVER A CHOSEN RANGE OF TIME SHIFTS, WITHOUT INTRODUCING ANY PHASE DISCONTINUITY.
utt_0021 utt 142.74 151.16 -X IN OUR EARLIER WORK, A POLYNOMIAL EVD BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR NOISE REDUCTION.
utt_0023 utt 151.41 159.30 -X ITS PERFORMANCE EVEN APPROACHES THE ORACLE MULTI-CHANNEL WIENER FILTER WHICH USES COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEAN SPEECH SIGNAL
utt_0025 utt 159.41 162.84 -X AND DOES NOT INTRODUCE ANY NOTICEABLE ARTIFACTS.
utt_0026 utt 163.89 168.12 -X IN THIS TALK, WE WILL FOCUS ON SPEECH DEREVERBERATION.
utt_0027 utt 168.12 178.87 -X WHEN THE TALKER SPEAKS IN AN ENCLOSED ROOM, THE THE RECEIVED SIGNAL AT THE DISTANT MICROPHONE PICKS
utt_0028 utt 178.87 185.50 -X UP MULTIPLE DELAYED AND ATTENUATED COPIES OF THE SPEECH SIGNAL ARISING FROM MULTI-PATH PROPAGATION
utt_0029 utt 185.75 193.91 -X INCLUDING THE DIRECT-PATH AND REFLECTIONS OF SURFACES SUCH AS WALLS AND OBJECTS IN THE ROOM.
utt_0030 utt 193.91 205.59 -X THE REVERBERANT CHANNEL CAN THEREFORE BE DECOMPOSED INTO THE DIRECT-PATH, EARLY AND LATE REFLECTIONS AS SHOWN IN RED AND BLUE, USING AN EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL ROOM.
utt_0032 utt 207.16 214.55 -X THE EARLY REFLECTIONS ARE CLOSELY SPACED ECHOES WHICH HAVE A DIRECT-PATH STRENGTHENING EFFECT
utt_0033 utt 214.71 228.06 -X AND MAY IMPROVE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHEREAS THE LATE REFLECTIONS COMPRISE RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED SMALL-AMPLITUDE COMPONENTS WHICH MAKES IT UNCORRELATED WITH
utt_0035 utt 228.06 234.78 -X THE FIRST TWO TERMS. HENCE, IT CAN BE TREATED AS AN ADDITIVE NOISE COMPONENT.
utt_0036 utt 234.78 243.16 -X INCORPORATING THIS REVERBERANT CHANNEL MODEL, THE RECEIVED SIGNAL X CAN THEREFORE BE DECOMPOSED
utt_0037 utt 243.16 253.15 -X INTO THE SPEECH COMPONENT, S TILDE IN BLUE, WHICH COMPRISE THE DIRECT PATH AND EARLY REFLECTIONS AND
utt_0038 utt 253.15 259.77 -X THE NOISE COMPONENT IN RED, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE LATE REFLECTIONS AND THE ADDITIVE NOISE.
utt_0039 utt 260.98 265.11 -X ACROSS M SENSORS, THE DATA VECTOR IS WRITTEN AS
utt_0040 utt 267.48 271.99 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM IS SUMMARIZED HERE
utt_0041 utt 272.41 278.65 -X AND THE GOAL IS TO OBTAIN AN ENHANCED VERSION OF THE SPEECH USING ONLY THE MICROPHONE OBSERVATIONS X.
utt_0042 utt 278.65 285.34 -X THE RECEIVED SIGNALS ARE USED TO COMPUTE THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX RXX,
utt_0043 utt 285.50 289.56 -X WHICH IS THEN USED AS THE INPUT INTO THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM
utt_0044 utt 290.26 295.36 -X TO GENERATE THE EIGENVALUES AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES.
utt_0045 utt 295.36 302.72 -X THE RECEIVED SIGNALS ARE THEN FILTERED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTERBANK TO PRODUCE THE ENHANCED OUTPUT.
utt_0047 utt 303.42 311.07 -X I WILL DESCRIBE THIS IN GREATER DETAIL USING AN EXAMPLE FROM THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT SETUP.
utt_0048 utt 311.07 321.82 -X ANECHOIC SPEECH FROM THE TIMIT CORPUS IS CONVOLVED WITH THE LECTURE ROOM two (IMPULSE RESPONSE) IN THE ACE CORPUS TO GENERATE THE REVERBERANT SPEECH.
utt_0050 utt 322.81 326.72 -X THE REVERBERATION TIME OF THIS ROOM IS one point two two SECONDS.
utt_0051 utt 328.09 335.61 -X ASSUMING STATIONARITY, THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX RXX IS COMPUTED USING THE RECEIVED SIGNALS X.
utt_0052 utt 337.34 351.71 -X MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE (I,J)-TH ELEMENT IS THE CROSS-CORRELATION FUNCTION USING THE I AND J MICROPHONE SIGNALS AND TAU IS THE TIME SHIFT PARAMETER.
utt_0054 utt 351.71 357.18 -X DUE TO SYMMETRY, THE Z-TRANSFORM OF RXX IS A PARA-HERMITIAN POLYNOMIAL MATRIX.
utt_0055 utt 358.04 364.96 -X IN THIS TALK, WE WILL USE CALLIGRAPHIC FONT TO DENOTE POLYNOMIAL MATRICES AND REGULAR FONT FOR MATRICES.
utt_0056 utt 367.51 371.52 -X AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE OF A POLYNOMIAL MATRIX IS SHOWN HERE.
utt_0057 utt 372.60 379.33 -X ON THE LEFT, WE CAN INTERPRET THE POLYNOMIAL MATRIX AS A POLYNOMIAL WITH MATRIX COEFFICIENTS
utt_0058 utt 381.43 389.86 -X OR EQUIVALENTLY, WE CAN INTERPRET IT AS A MATRIX WITH POLYNOMIAL ELEMENTS AS SHOWN ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0059 utt 392.03 394.08 -X IN MULTI-CHANNEL SIGNAL PROCESSING,
utt_0060 utt 394.08 399.65 -X ONE TYPICALLY COMPUTES THE SPATIAL COVARIANCE MATRIX WHICH CAN BE SEEN AS THE SPECIAL CASE
utt_0061 utt 400.92 406.98 -X OF THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX WHEN TAU IS EQUALS TO ZERO, MARKED BY THE RED CROSS SIGNS.
utt_0062 utt 406.98 412.93 -X THEY ARE COMPUTED USING THE INNER PRODUCT BETWEEN THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS.
utt_0063 utt 412.93 420.35 -X BY COMPUTING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SENSOR PAIRS ACROSS ALL LAGS, WE GET A POLYNOMIAL MATRIX
utt_0064 utt 420.67 429.79 -X WITH THE AUTO-CORRELATION TERMS ON THE DIAGONAL AND CROSS-CORRELATION TERMS ON THE OFF-DIAGONALS.
utt_0065 utt 429.79 438.98 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD OF RXX IS THE FOLLOWING, WHERE CAPITAL LAMBDA AND CAPITAL U ARE THE EIGENVALUE
utt_0066 utt 438.98 445.97 -X AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES, RESPECTIVELY. THE SUPERSCRIPT P DENOTES THE PARA-HERMITIAN
utt_0067 utt 445.97 454.31 -X OPERATOR THAT INVOLVES THE HERMITIAN TRANSPOSE FOLLOWED BY A TIME-REVERSAL OPERATION. SINCE THE
utt_0068 utt 454.31 463.01 -X SPEECH SIGNALS AND NOISE SIGNALS ARE UNCORRELATED, THE POLYNOMIAL EVD DECOMPOSES THE POLYNOMIAL MATRIX
utt_0069 utt 463.23 471.46 -X INTO THE SIGNAL AND NOISE SUBSPACES IN BLUE AND RED RESPECTIVELY AND THEY ARE ORTHOGONAL.
utt_0070 utt 472.77 479.43 -X I WILL NOW DEMONSTRATE HOW THE POLYNOMIAL EVD OPERATES USING OUR RXX EXAMPLE.
utt_0071 utt 479.65 486.79 -X THE GOAL OF THE POLYNOMIAL EVD IS TO DIAGONALIZE THE POLYNOMIAL MATRIX AT ALL LAGS.
utt_0072 utt 492.26 502.98 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE ALGORITHM STOPS WHEN THE OFF-DIAGONAL ELEMENTS ACROSS ALL LAGS ARE LESS THAN THIS PREDEFINED THRESHOLD.
utt_0073 utt 507.78 514.82 -X AFTER THE ALGORITHM HAS CONVERGED, WE GET THE FOLLOWING EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES.
utt_0074 utt 516.48 522.02 -X TO PERFORM THE POLYNOMIAL EVD, ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED.
utt_0075 utt 524.42 529.25 -X THE RECEIVED SIGNALS X ARE THEN FILTERED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTERBANK U(Z)
utt_0076 utt 529.25 533.41 -X TO PRODUCE OUTPUTS WHICH ARE STRONGLY DECORRELATED.
utt_0077 utt 536.13 542.42 -X BECAUSE WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING A SINGLE SPEAKER, THE ENHANCED AND DEREVERBERATED SPEECH SIGNAL
utt_0078 utt 542.85 549.13 -X CAN BE RECOVERED IN THE FIRST CHANNEL VIA A WEIGHTED RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SPEECH SUBSPACE.
utt_0079 utt 551.91 556.74 -X THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT ON THE RIGHT IS PRODUCED BY FILTERING THE RECEIVED SIGNALS X
utt_0080 utt 557.19 560.93 -X THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTERBANK GENERATED EARLIER.
utt_0081 utt 565.06 575.88 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD APPROACH IS COMPARED AGAINST THE GENERALIZED WEIGHTED PREDICTION ERROR (GWPE) A WELL-KNOWN DEREVERBERATION ALGORITHM,
utt_0083 utt 575.88 580.90 -X THE MULTI-CHANNEL SUBSPACE ALGORITHM WHICH USES AN EVD,
utt_0084 utt 582.82 593.29 -X AND THE ORACLE MULTI-CHANNEL WIENER FILTER (OMWF), WHICH HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEAN SPEECH SIGNAL AND THIS ESTABLISHES THE UPPER BOUND PERFORMANCE.
utt_0086 utt 593.96 600.65 -X AN INSTRUMENTAL DEREVERBERATION MEASURE IS THE DIRECT TO REVERBERANT RATIO (DRR)
utt_0087 utt 601.51 606.63 -X BUT THE MODIFIED IMPULSE RESPONSES AFTER PROCESSING ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE.
utt_0088 utt 607.59 619.32 -X INSTEAD, THE NORMALIZED SIGNAL TO REVERBERANT RATIO (NSRR) WHICH IS A SIGNAL BASED MEASURE SHOWN TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE DRR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
utt_0089 utt 619.65 623.50 -X AND THE BARK SPECTRAL DISTORTION (BSD) ARE USED.
utt_0090 utt 624.13 630.98 -X WE ALSO USE THE FREQUENCY WEIGHTED SEGMENTAL SNR TO MEASURE THE NOISE REDUCTION PERFORMANCE
utt_0091 utt 631.36 634.50 -X AND PESQ FOR SPEECH QUALITY.
utt_0092 utt 637.16 641.48 -X THE SPECTROGRAM OF THE REVERBERANT SPEECH EXAMPLE USED EARLIER IS SHOWN HERE
utt_0093 utt 641.57 644.01 -X AND THIS IS HOW IT SOUNDS LIKE.
utt_0094 utt 644.01 654.79 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0096 utt 654.79 658.06 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD PROCESSED SIGNAL IS PRESENTED HERE.
utt_0097 utt 658.21 664.75 -X WE OBSERVE THAT THE SPECTROGRAM LOOKS CLEANER AND SHARPER AND HERE IS HOW IT SOUNDS LIKE.
utt_0099 utt 664.75 675.18 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0101 utt 675.56 679.98 -X WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE SPEECH STRUCTURE IS PRESERVED AND
utt_0102 utt 684.01 687.40 -X NO AUDIBLE ARTIFACTS WERE INTRODUCED.
utt_0103 utt 687.43 694.54 -X THE GWPE PROCESSED SIGNAL WILL BE COMPARED BUT WE WILL FIRST LISTEN TO THE REVERBERANT SPEECH SIGNAL AGAIN.
utt_0104 utt 694.54 706.03 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0106 utt 706.03 706.67 -X THE GWPE.
utt_0107 utt 706.67 719.40 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0109 utt 719.40 722.99 -X THE SPECTROGRAM OF THE GWPE PROCESSED OUTPUT IS MUCH CLEANER
utt_0110 utt 723.14 734.09 -X BUT IF YOU LISTEN CLOSELY, YOU OBSERVE THAT GWPE HEAVILY SUPPRESSES MOST OF THE EARLIER BUT NOT LATER COMPONENTS AND THIS IS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE ORIGINAL PAPER.
utt_0112 utt 735.94 746.70 -X WE THEN TAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE REVERBERANT AND ENHANCED SIGNAL TO GIVE US THE SUBTRACTED SIGNAL, WHICH INDICATES WHAT HAS BEEN REMOVED BY THE PROCESSING.
utt_0114 utt 746.92 751.69 -X WE FIRST LISTENED TO GWPE SUBTRACTED AND THIS IS HOW IT SOUNDS LIKE.
utt_0115 utt 751.69 762.09 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0117 utt 762.35 763.89 -X POLYNOMIAL EVD SUBTRACTED.
utt_0118 utt 763.89 776.53 -X THE SITUATION INVOLVES SOME POLITICAL PERILS IT'S HARD TO TELL AN ORIGINAL FROM A FORGERY DON'T ASK ME TO CARRY AN OILY RAG LIKE THAT.
utt_0120 utt 776.53 785.20 -X THIS STRENGTHENS OUR EARLIER FINDING THAT GWPE REMOVES THE EARLIER COMPONENTS WHEREAS POLYNOMIAL EVD REMOVES THE LATER COMPONENTS.
utt_0121 utt 785.32 794.89 -X OVERALL, POLYNOMIAL EVD PROVIDED THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT IN NSRR AND IT COMES IN A SECOND IN TERMS OF BSD
utt_0122 utt 795.31 801.07 -X AFTER THE GWPE WHICH ALSO PROVIDED THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT IN PESQ.
utt_0123 utt 802.64 808.14 -X IN PRACTICAL SCENARIOS, HOWEVER, ADDITIVE BACKGROUND NOISE ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED.
utt_0124 utt 808.30 813.87 -X IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DEREVERBERATION PERFORMANCE WHEN THERE IS NOISE.
utt_0125 utt 815.08 820.46 -X WE NOW CONSIDER THE PRESENCE OF DIFFUSE BABBLE NOISE OBTAINED FROM THE ACE RECORDINGS.
utt_0126 utt 821.00 828.30 -X THE TABLE HERE SHOWS THAT POLYNOMIAL EVD OUTPERFORMS THE OTHER ALGORITHMS IN DEREVERBERATION,
utt_0127 utt 829.29 839.31 -X IT PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL NOISE REDUCTION AND EVEN OUTPERFORMS THE ORACLE MWF WHICH PERFORMS BEST IN PESQ.
utt_0129 utt 841.52 848.40 -X I HAVE INTRODUCED POLYNOMIAL MATRICES AND PEVD AS A TOOL FOR PROCESSING THEM.
utt_0130 utt 848.40 860.18 -X I HAVE ALSO OUTLINED A POLYNOMIAL EVD BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM AND DEMONSTRATED ITS EFFECTIVENESS FOR DEREVERBERATION EVEN IN THE PRESENCE OF NOISE.
utt_0132 utt 860.65 864.02 -X THE APPROACH DOES NOT INTRODUCE ANY NOTICEABLE ARTIFACTS
utt_0133 utt 864.43 873.33 -X AND IS COMPLETELY BLIND AND UNSUPERVISED, AND IT DOES NOT USE ANY NOISE ESTIMATOR.
utt_0134 utt 873.33 875.28 -X THESE ARE THE REFERENCES USED IN THIS TALK.
utt_0135 utt 880.59 886.77 -X THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND THE LISTENING EXAMPLES CAN BE FOUND IN THE QR CODE OR IN THE URL LINK.
