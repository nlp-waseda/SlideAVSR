utt_0000 utt 2.03 11.02 -X IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN INTEREST IN OUT OF DISTRIBUTION DETECTION, OR OODD, OFTEN WITH TIGHT INTEGRATION TO DEEP LEARNING.
utt_0002 utt 12.36 19.35 -X OODD IS DEFINED AS DETECTING INPUTS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE OR UNLIKELY UNDER A TARGET DISTRIBUTION.
utt_0003 utt 19.35 25.49 -X WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY COMPONENT TO ANY COMPLETE MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATION ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDICAL DOMAIN.
utt_0005 utt 26.41 33.52 -X JUST AS A PHYSICIAN HAS TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE COMFORTABLE MAKING DECISIONS, NEURAL NETWORKS HAVE SIMILAR LIMITS.
utt_0007 utt 33.52 38.55 -X THESE LIMITS ARE DEFINED BY THE DATA THAT WAS USED TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE THE MODEL.
utt_0008 utt 38.99 43.80 -X WE WOULD LIKE TO USE OODD TO LIMIT WHAT MODELS PROCESS.
utt_0009 utt 44.18 49.59 -X WE ARGUE THAT THE NECESSITY OF OODD IS SUPPORTED BY TWO CONSIDERATIONS.
utt_0010 utt 49.97 51.99 -X FIRST OF WHICH IS USABILITY.
utt_0011 utt 52.24 57.81 -X AS WE TRANSITION MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS FROM RESEARCH LABS TO THE HANDS OF THE END USER,
utt_0012 utt 57.81 60.69 -X USABILITY OF THESE TOOLS BECOMES PIVOTAL TO THEIR SUCCESS.
utt_0013 utt 60.82 67.16 -X ONE COMMON CHARACTERISTIC OF GOOD USABILITY IS TO FAIL GRACEFULLY WHEN HANDLING USER ERRORS.
utt_0014 utt 67.50 79.06 -X IN ML ASSISTED DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, THIS MEANS EQUIPPING THE TOOL WITH THE CAPACITY TO REJECT PREDICTIONS ON ERRONEOUS INPUT DATA, THEREBY PREVENTING THE “GARBAGE-IN, GARBAGE-OUT” SCENARIO.
utt_0017 utt 79.06 86.39 -X FOR ML TOOLS FACING USERS OUTSIDE THE COMPUTER SCIENCE COMMUNITY, THIS CLARITY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.
utt_0019 utt 87.67 90.23 -X THE SECOND REASON IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR SAFETY.
utt_0020 utt 90.23 96.85 -X IN APPLICATIONS LIKE ML ASSISTED DIAGNOSIS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE SAFETY OF THE PATIENTS.
utt_0022 utt 96.98 106.90 -X A WELL DOCUMENTED FAILURE MODE IS WHEN THE PREDICTOR ATTEMPTS TO EXTRAPOLATE ON INPUTS OUTSIDE THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS TRAINING DATA.
utt_0024 utt 106.90 113.46 -X OODD PROVIDES A SAFETY MECHANISM THAT PREVENTS FAILURES OF THE PREDICTOR FROM HARMING THE USER THROUGH INACCURATE PREDICTIONS.
utt_0026 utt 113.65 121.88 -X IN THIS WORK, WE BENCHMARK OODD METHODS ON A LARGE SUITE OF MEDICAL IMAGING DATASETS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE LANDSCAPE.
utt_0028 utt 121.88 127.32 -X OUR GOAL IS FORM A RECOMMENDATION TO PRACTITIONERS ON WHICH OODD METHODS TO DEPLOY.
utt_0057 utt 267.84 271.97 -X HERE ARE SOME DETAILED RESULTS FOR THE CHEST X-RAY TASK.
utt_0058 utt 272.06 275.08 -X USECASE one IS AT THE TOP AND USECASE three IS AT THE BOTTOM.
utt_0059 utt 275.30 280.39 -X WE REPORT THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH METHOD AVERAGE ACROSS DIFFERENT DATASETS IN THAT USE CASE.
utt_0060 utt 280.54 284.04 -X FOR PERFORMANCE METRICS, WE LOOK AT ACCURACY AND AUPRC
utt_0061 utt 285.09 290.05 -X IN TERMS OF METHODS, OUR BENCHMARK INCLUDES twenty-two VARIANTS OF EXISTING OODD METHODS.
utt_0062 utt 291.58 297.44 -X WE INCLUDE THREE TYPES OF OODD METHODS WHICH ARE COLORED CODED: GREEN, BLUE, AND RED.
utt_0063 utt 297.44 303.08 -X UNDER DATA-ONLY METHODS IN GREEN WE HAVE K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS - THEY DO NOT REQUIRE ANY TRAINED NETWORK.
utt_0065 utt 305.38 310.41 -X CLASSIFIER BASED METHODS IN BLUE MAKE USE OF THE NETWORK TRAINED FOR THE DOWNSTREAM APPLICATION.
utt_0068 utt 315.22 321.97 -X OF THE EXISTING NETWORK AND OFTEN THE FORWARD PASS CAN BE USED FOR THE TASK AS WELL AS THE
utt_0069 utt 322.21 323.88 -X OOD DETERMINATION.
utt_0070 utt 325.22 330.15 -X AUXILIARY MODEL IN RED BASED METHODS DO NOT USE THE DOWNSTREAM CLASSIFIER.
utt_0071 utt 330.15 337.29 -X INSTEAD THEY REQUIRE A GENERATIVE MODEL OR AN AUTOENCODER THAT’S TRAINED ON IN-DISTRIBUTION DATA.
utt_0073 utt 337.29 339.78 -X THIS RESULTS IN EXTRA SETUP TIME AND RESOURCES.
utt_0074 utt 339.78 347.91 -X HOWEVER, THESE MODELS ARE INDEPENDENT AND CAN BE MORE GENERAL AS THEY DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT LABELS OF IN-DISTRIBUTION DATA.
utt_0076 utt 348.16 351.75 -X HERE ARE DETAILED RESULTS FOR HISTOLOGY SEGMENTATION.
utt_0077 utt 351.75 356.20 -X WE DON'T HAVE A USECASE three HERE BECAUSE POPULAR TASKS ARE ONLY BINARY.
utt_0078 utt 356.55 365.45 -X FOR USECASE two HERE WE BREAST TISSUE INSTEAD OF LYMPH NODE TISSUE AS WELL AS TISSUES STAINED WITH OTHER DYES.
utt_0080 utt 365.70 369.42 -X USECASE one INCLUDES IMAGES OF BLOOD DROPLETS.
utt_0081 utt 369.45 373.45 -X HERE ARE DETAILED RESULTS WITH FUNDUS IMAGING FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.
utt_0082 utt 373.48 379.53 -X FOR USECASE three WE USE IMAGES WITH GLAUCOMA WHICH IS A DISEASE NOT PRESENT IN THE DR IMAGES.
utt_0083 utt 379.53 385.80 -X FOR USECASE two WE USE THE DRIMDB DATASET WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR QUALITY TESTING.
utt_0084 utt 385.80 391.44 -X IT IS COMPOSED OF IMAGES ACQUIRED WITH THE CORRECT CAMERA BUT OF THE WRONG THING OR OUT OF FOCUS.
utt_0088 utt 400.33 407.66 -X WE ALSO STUDY THE TIME-PERFORMANCE TRADEOFF OF THESE METHODS AND FIND THAT THE BINARY CLASSIFIER IS FAST AND ACHIEVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE.
utt_0090 utt 455.02 468.08 -X WE CAUTION PRACTITIONERS THAT EMPLOY OODD METHODS THAT IMAGES VERY CLOSE TO THE TRAINING DISTRIBUTION BUT NOT IN IT MAY NOT BE DETECTED AND COULD CAUSE A MODEL TO PRODUCE UNEXPECTED RESULTS.
utt_0093 utt 468.08 472.66 -X FINALLY, OUR WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON DETECTING THESE TYPES OF OOD DATA
