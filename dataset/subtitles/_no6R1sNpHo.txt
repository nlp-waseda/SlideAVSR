utt_0000 utt 0.46 12.14 -X WELCOME. TODAY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT LATENT SPACE MOTION ANALYSIS FOR COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE. MY NAME IS MATEEN ULHAQ AND MY COLLEAGUE IS DR. IVAN BAJIĆ. IN COLLABORATIVE
utt_0002 utt 12.14 16.82 -X INTELLIGENCE, DEEP LEARNING MODELS CAN BE SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS. THE FIRST HALF OF THE
utt_0004 utt 22.07 24.79 -X FEATURE TENSORS ARE TRANSMITTED OVER THE NETWORK.
utt_0005 utt 27.73 38.90 -X PROCESSING AN INPUT FRAME THROUGH PART OF A DEEP MODEL YIELDS A FEATURE TENSOR. ONE PROBLEM THAT ARISES IN COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE REGARDS HOW MOTION BETWEEN INPUT FRAMES CORRESPONDS
utt_0007 utt 38.90 48.95 -X TO THE MOTION BETWEEN THE TENSORS. THE QUESTION IS, GIVEN A REFERENCE TENSOR AND THE MOTION BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE INPUT FRAMES, CAN WE DETERMINE THE MOTION BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE TENSORS?
utt_0011 utt 66.58 75.61 -X THE TENSOR CHANNEL ROUGHLY CORRESPONDS TO THE MOTION WITHIN THE INPUT VIDEO. IN THE FOLLOWING SLIDES, WE WILL SHOW WHY THIS IS TO BE EXPECTED AND ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP
utt_0015 utt 87.80 99.78 -X A NATURAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT THE MOTION WITHIN THE TENSOR IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO A RESCALED VERSION OF THE INPUT FRAME MOTION. WE CAN SHOW THIS FOR THE THREE MAIN TYPES OF OPERATIONS
utt_0017 utt 99.78 111.70 -X WHICH OCCUR IN CNNS: CONVOLUTION, POINTWISE ACTIVATION, AND POOLING. WE WILL SHOW THAT THE MOTION BEFORE EACH OPERATION IS APPLIED IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE MOTION AFTER
utt_0019 utt 111.70 119.13 -X THE OPERATION. BY INDUCTION, THIS IMPLIES THAT THE TENSOR MOTION CAN BE DETERMINED EVEN SEVERAL LAYERS DEEP WITHIN THE CNN.
utt_0021 utt 119.13 128.57 -X THESE ARE THE OPTICAL FLOW EQUATIONS FOR twoD AND oneD. FIRST, THERE’S THE twoD EQUATION,
utt_0022 utt 128.57 142.78 -X WHICH IS TYPICALLY USED IN IMAGE PROCESSING. I REPRESENTS THE INTENSITY OF A PIXEL WITHIN THE IMAGE OR TENSOR. V REPRESENTS THE MOTION VECTORS, WHICH HAVE AN X AND Y COMPONENT.
utt_0024 utt 143.54 151.67 -X FOR SIMPLICITY, WE WILL BE USING THE oneD EQUATION. HOWEVER, THE SAME IDEAS CAN BE EXTENDED TO twoD.
utt_0026 utt 151.67 163.96 -X HERE, WE PROVIDE A SHORT PROOF FOR WHY THE MOTION BEFORE CONVOLUTION APPROXIMATELY EQUALS TO THE MOTION AFTER CONVOLUTION. AT THE TOP, WE HAVE THE OPTICAL FLOW EQUATION. AFTER APPLYING
utt_0028 utt 163.96 177.68 -X A CONVOLUTIONAL FILTER F TO THE IMAGE I, WE OBTAIN THIS EQUATION, WHERE Ṽ REPRESENTS THE FLOW AFTER THE OPERATION. BY COMMUTATIVITY OF LINEAR OPERATORS, WE CAN INTERCHANGE THE
utt_0030 utt 177.68 189.24 -X ORDER OF THE CONVOLUTION AND THE DERIVATIVES IN ORDER TO END UP WITH THIS EQUATION. FOR THE CASE WHERE THE TERM WITHIN THE PARENTHESES IS IDENTICALLY zero, WE SEE THAT Ṽ SATISFIES
utt_0032 utt 189.24 193.88 -X THE ORIGINAL OPTICAL FLOW EQUATION, SO ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION IS THAT Ṽ EQUALS V. THERE
utt_0033 utt 195.10 206.49 -X ARE OF COURSE OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, AND IN CASES WHERE THE TERM IN THE PARENTHESES IS NON-ZERO, THE FILTER F ALSO MAY EXERT AN INFLUENCE UP TO THE SIZE OF THE FILTER WINDOW.
utt_0035 utt 209.95 218.69 -X NEXT, WE SHOW HOW POINTWISE ACTIVATIONS ALSO APPROXIMATELY PRESERVE MOTION. THE DERIVATION
utt_0036 utt 218.69 231.33 -X IS SIMILAR TO CONVOLUTION, WHICH WE LOOKED AT IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. WE TAKE THE OPTICAL FLOW EQUATION, AND THIS TIME WE APPLY SOME ACTIVATION FUNCTION Σ TO THE IMAGE. Σ MAY
utt_0038 utt 231.36 244.38 -X BE SIGMOID, RELU, TANH, OR ANY OTHER ACTIVATION FUNCTION. BY THE CHAIN RULE, WE MAY EXTRACT THE DERIVATIVE Σ′. THE TERM WITHIN THE PARENTHESES ONCE AGAIN IS THE OPTICAL FLOW
utt_0040 utt 244.38 248.99 -X EQUATION, WHICH IF IT IS zero, THEN ONE SOLUTION IS Ṽ EQUALS V.
utt_0041 utt 252.54 263.39 -X THE ANALYSIS FOR THE MAX POOLING OPERATION IS A BIT MORE INVOLVED, BUT THE DERIVATION CAN BE FOUND WITHIN THE PAPER. THE RESULT IS THAT Ṽ IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE
utt_0043 utt 263.39 269.38 -X ORIGINAL MOTION RESCALED BY DOWNSAMPLING FACTOR S, WHICH IS TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE STRIDE LENGTH.
utt_0045 utt 274.88 286.34 -X NEXT, WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT SOME EXPERIMENTS WE PERFORMED TO ATTEMPT TO RECONSTRUCT A TENSOR BY APPLYING A RESCALED MOTION CALCULATED BETWEEN THE INPUT FRAMES. IN THIS CASE, THE SCALING
utt_0047 utt 286.34 295.40 -X IS DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF PRECEDING POOLING LAYERS WITHIN THE MODEL, AND THEIR STRIDE LENGTHS. WE THEN CALCULATED THE NORMALIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR BETWEEN THE PREDICTED
utt_0049 utt 295.40 302.40 -X TENSOR AND THE GROUND TRUTH TENSOR.
utt_0053 utt 321.69 326.79 -X IDEA OF RESCALED MOTION, WE TAKE THE REFERENCE TENSOR, AND THE KNOWN MOTION BETWEEN THE INPUT
utt_0061 utt 367.24 371.85 -X HERE, WE HAVE QUANTIFIED THE ERRORS FOR EACH OF THE BASIC TRANSFORMATIONS, NAMELY TRANSLATION,
utt_0062 utt 371.85 379.45 -X ROTATION, SCALING, AND SHEARING. FOR INSTANCE, IN THIS PLOT, WE SHOW HOW MUCH RECONSTRUCTION
utt_0063 utt 380.17 387.64 -X ERROR THERE IS IN TRANSLATIONS. THE VARIOUS CURVES REPRESENT VARIOUS DEEP LAYERS WITHIN
utt_0064 utt 388.33 394.76 -X RESNETminus thirty-four AND DENSENETminus one hundred and twenty-one. ON THE RIGHT, WE SEE HOW THE ERROR CHANGES WITH RESPECT
utt_0065 utt 396.77 403.48 -X TO ROTATION. THE MORE ROTATION IS APPLIED, THE LARGER THE ERROR BECOMES. HOWEVER, AS
utt_0067 utt 408.78 409.52 -X NRMSE.
utt_0068 utt 413.16 427.05 -X HERE, WE PERFORMED GENERAL six-PARAMETER AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS THAT WERE RANDOMLY GENERATED WITHIN THE PARAMETER RANGES SPECIFIED, AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO RECONSTRUCT THE FEATURE MAPS AT VARIOUS DEEP LAYERS. THIS RESULTS IN THE FOLLOWING DISTRIBUTIONS OF NORMALIZED
utt_0071 utt 427.05 433.04 -X ROOT MEAN SQUARED ERRORS. THE MEANS OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS ARE ALL BELOW A NRMSE OF zero point zero four.
utt_0072 utt 434.73 449.26 -X FOR COMPARISON, THIS CORRESPONDS TO A PSNR OF twenty-eight DB FOR REGULAR IMAGES. FOR ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THESE DEEPER LAYERS WITHIN THESE CONVOLUTIONAL MODELS ARE
utt_0075 utt 462.57 467.54 -X BEFORE WE FINISH, LET’S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE VIDEO. THIS PARTICULAR TENSOR CHANNEL
utt_0077 utt 474.10 485.65 -X SEEM TO FADE IN AND OUT WITHIN THE TENSOR CHANNEL. NONETHELESS, AS WE SHOWED IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, FOR REASONABLE ROTATION ANGLES BETWEEN FRAMES, THE MOTION COMPENSATED TENSORS
utt_0079 utt 485.65 497.94 -X OFTEN RESULT IN REASONABLY GOOD RECONSTRUCTIONS. LASTLY, DEPENDING ON THE FILTER, THE MOTION ITSELF NEED NOT BE EXACTLY DETERMINED BY THE PRECEDING LAYER’S MOTION. HOWEVER, ANY INACCURACIES
utt_0081 utt 497.94 504.08 -X THIS CAUSES ARE LIMITED TO THE FILTER WINDOW SIZE. IN THIS CASE, THE threeXthree IS SUFFICIENTLY
utt_0082 utt 507.05 512.02 -X SMALL AS TO NOT CAUSE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS WITHIN THE MOTION.
utt_0083 utt 517.93 529.65 -X IN CONCLUSION, WE DERIVED A SIMPLE APPROXIMATE RELATIONSHIP OF MOTION WITHIN THE TENSOR CHANNELS BY ANALYZING TYPICAL OPERATIONS IN CNNS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE RECONSTRUCTION ERROR FOR
utt_0085 utt 529.65 533.33 -X SMALL AFFINE TRANSFORMATIONS WITHIN THE INPUT IS four% NRMSE.
utt_0086 utt 537.23 540.66 -1.6729 THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING THIS PRESENTATION.
