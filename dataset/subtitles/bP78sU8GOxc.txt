utt_0001 utt 1.39 5.14 -X I’M VARUN AND I WILL TALKING ABOUT SINGLE-PHOTON STRUCTURED LIGHT.
utt_0002 utt 6.06 14.74 -X STRUCTURED LIGHT threeD IMAGING HAS INHERENT TRADEOFFS BALANCING ACQUISITION TIME, PRECISION OF SCAN AND ROBUSTNESS TO HIGH NOISE REGIMES.
utt_0004 utt 14.80 22.93 -X FOR INSTANCE, CERTAIN STRUCTURED LIGHT TECHNIQUES ACHIEVE HIGH DEPTH RESOLUTION BY PROJECTING MULTIPLE PATTERNS BUT REQUIRE LONG ACQUISITION TIMES.
utt_0006 utt 23.41 30.48 -X AT THE OTHER EXTREME, SOME TECHNIQUES PROJECT A SINGLE PATTERN, FACILITATING HIGH SPEED BUT RESULT IN LOSS OF DETAIL.
utt_0008 utt 30.48 37.24 -X PRESENTED HERE ARE SOME CHALLENGING LOW-SNR REGIMES THAT EXACERBATE THE TRADEOFFS IN STRUCTURED LIGHT.
utt_0010 utt 37.27 43.67 -X THESE INCLUDE DARK OBJECTS, STRONG AMBIENT ILLUMINATION, AND HIGHLY DYNAMIC SCENES.
utt_0011 utt 44.08 51.16 -X IN THIS WORK, WE INTRODUCE A NOVEL STRUCTURED LIGHT SYSTEM BASED ON SINGLE-PHOTON AVALANCHE DIODES OR SPADS.
utt_0013 utt 51.76 57.62 -X A SPAD PIXEL FUNCTIONS LIKE A PHOTON TEASPOON THAT CAN DETECT THE ARRIVAL OF INDIVIDUAL PHOTONS.
utt_0015 utt 58.55 67.51 -X IF MORE THAN ONE PHOTON ARRIVES DURING AN EXPOSURE WINDOW, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NUMBER OF PHOTONS, THE RETURNED VALUE IS one AND zero OTHERWISE.
utt_0017 utt 68.21 73.53 -X SINCE PHOTON ARRIVALS ARE STOCHASTIC, THESE PIXEL VALUES ARE BINARY RANDOM VARIABLES.
utt_0018 utt 75.13 78.14 -X SO, WHAT DO SPAD IMAGES LOOK LIKE?
utt_0019 utt 78.14 83.87 -X EACH IMAGE IS BINARY WITH A GREATER FREQUENCY OF one’S IN BRIGHT REGIONS AND LESSER IN DARK REGIONS.
utt_0021 utt 84.31 89.53 -X THE PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF NOISE IS THE RANDOM ARRIVAL OF PHOTONS, ALSO CALLED PHOTON-NOISE.
utt_0024 utt 101.82 109.57 -X SINGLE-PHOTON SL CONSISTS OF A SPAD CAMERA AND A DMD-BASED PROJECTOR OPERATED AT EXTREMELY HIGH SPEEDS.
utt_0026 utt 109.88 116.42 -X OUR KEY OBSERVATION IS THAT BINARY FRAMES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR A LARGE FAMILY OF BINARY STRUCTURED LIGHT TECHNIQUES.
utt_0028 utt 117.79 124.87 -X WE DESIGN NOVEL CODING SCHEMES THAT OFFER ROBUSTNESS TO PHOTON-NOISE, BASED ON A COMBINATION OF GRAY CODES AND PARITY PATTERNS.
utt_0030 utt 125.21 133.57 -X HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE PARITY PATTERNS, OWING TO THEIR HIGH-SPATIAL FREQUENCY, AND ARE STRONGLY DISTORTED BY IMAGING PHENOMENA SUCH AS PROJECTOR DEFOCUS.
utt_0032 utt 133.82 142.82 -X FOR THIS REASON, WE DESIGN A NEW CLASS OF HIERARCHICAL CODES USING ERROR CORRECTION AND BINARY SHIFTING THAT PROVIDE ROBUSTNESS TO VARIOUS NON-IDEALITIES.
utt_0034 utt 144.07 148.01 -X WE NOW PRESENT threeD RECONSTRUCTION RESULTS USING SINGLE-PHOTON STRUCTURED LIGHT.
utt_0035 utt 149.12 152.93 -X OUR PROTOTYPE USES THE SWISSSPADtwo ARRAY, A 51two X two56 PIXEL SENSOR.
utt_0036 utt 154.53 161.64 -X WE ALSO USE THE DLPsix thousand, five hundred DMD WHICH CAN BE OPERATED AT twenty,zero HZ WITH A RESOLUTION OF one thousand and twenty-four X seven hundred and sixty-eight
utt_0037 utt 162.34 163.24 -X PIXELS.
utt_0038 utt 163.75 169.74 -X FOR SIMPLICITY, WE RUN THE SPAD ARRAY AT THE SAME SPEED AS THE DMD-BASED PROJECTOR.
utt_0039 utt 170.12 175.47 -X WE FIRST DEMONSTRATE THE HIGH-PRECISION OF SINGLE-PHOTON SL ON A STATIC SCENE.
utt_0040 utt 175.47 179.02 -X WE SHOW A SERIES OF PROJECTED PATTERNS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING FRAMES.
utt_0041 utt 179.43 184.94 -X ONE WAY TO IMPROVE THE ROBUSTNESS OF CONVENTIONAL CODES TO PHOTON-NOISE IS TO SIMPLY REPEAT THEM.
utt_0043 utt 185.13 188.33 -X UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DOES NOT ACHIEVE GOOD PERFORMANCE.
utt_0044 utt 188.71 196.05 -X IN CONTRAST, GIVEN THE SAME ACQUISITION TIME AND ILLUMINATION POWER, OUR PROPOSED CODING SCHEME PROVIDES CONSIDERABLY BETTER RESULTS.
utt_0046 utt 196.97 202.16 -X WE NOW DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES OF SINGLE-PHOTON SL ON LOW ALBEDO SCENES.
utt_0047 utt 202.44 207.86 -X THE REFERENCE IMAGE SHOWS AN INVERTED V-GROOVE COVERED BY ACKTAR METAL VELVET, A MATERIAL
utt_0048 utt 208.33 210.67 -X WHICH RETURNS JUST zero point one% OF INCIDENT LIGHT.
utt_0049 utt 211.02 216.46 -X EVIDENTLY, MUCH FEWER PHOTONS ARE DETECTED WHEN A BRIGHT PATTERN IS PROJECTED.
utt_0050 utt 216.46 221.68 -X DESPITE THIS, OUR PROPOSED CODING SCHEME CAN OBTAIN AN ACCURATE threeD RECONSTRUCTION.
utt_0053 utt 230.26 235.64 -X NEXT, WE DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES OF SINGLE-PHOTON SL ON HIGHLY DYNAMIC SCENES.
utt_0054 utt 235.64 238.71 -X HERE IS A WHITE CLOTH RAPIDLY WAVED IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA.
utt_0055 utt 238.80 242.20 -X CAPTURING SUCH A NON-RIGID OBJECT REQUIRES HIGH-SPEED ACQUISITION.
utt_0056 utt 242.38 245.20 -X OTHERWISE, EXCESSIVE MOTION BLUR IS INDUCED.
utt_0057 utt 245.75 252.53 -X AS THE DEPTH VIDEO DEMONSTRATES, SINGLE-PHOTON SL CAN RECOVER DETAILED threeD GEOMETRY OF NON-RIGID OBJECTS.
utt_0059 utt 252.75 258.87 -X WE ALSO INCLUDE MESH RECONSTRUCTIONS OF A FEW TIME STAMPS TO CLEARLY SHOW THE DEFORMING FOLDS OF THE CLOTH.
utt_0061 utt 259.76 266.07 -X HERE’S ANOTHER SCENE WITH EXTREMELY FAST MOTION---A JACK-IN-THE-BOX TOY WHICH SPRINGS UP IN LESS THAN forty MILLISECONDS.
utt_0063 utt 266.52 274.27 -X A CONVENTIONAL DEPTH SENSOR SUCH AS THE KINECT OPERATES AT thirty FPS AND IS TOO SLOW TO RECOVER DEPTH AT INTERMEDIATE INSTANTS.
utt_0065 utt 274.77 280.67 -X HOWEVER, SINGLE-PHOTON SL CAN RUN AT A SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER two thousand FPS AND RECOVERS FINER-DETAILS
utt_0066 utt 280.95 283.87 -X OF THE TOY AS IT SPRINGS UP, SUCH AS ITS EARS.
utt_0067 utt 284.69 290.97 -X IN SUMMARY, SINGLE-PHOTON SL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS VARIOUS TRADEOFFS INHERENT TO STRUCTURED LIGHT SYSTEMS.
utt_0069 utt 291.13 297.12 -X SINGLE-PHOTON SL CAN ENABLE EXTREME threeD IMAGING THAT FEATURES HIGH-SPEED, HIGH-PRECISION,
utt_0070 utt 297.12 299.61 -2.3079 AND ROBUSTNESS IN LOW-SNR CONDITIONS.
