utt_0001 utt 14.77 18.83 -X DETECTING INDEPENDENT PRONOUN BIAS WITH PARTIALLY-SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION.
utt_0002 utt 18.83 20.18 -X I AM ROBERT MONARCH.
utt_0009 utt 48.72 53.33 -X THESE ARE PRONOUNS COMMON TO ALMOST ALL ENGLISH SPEAKERS.
utt_0010 utt 53.33 60.47 -X BUT THERE ARE OTHERS, AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME ARE ONLY USED IN SOME GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, LIKE Y'ALL.
utt_0012 utt 60.95 65.85 -X AND SOME HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY CONSTRUCTED BY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES LIKE
utt_0013 utt 66.00 70.84 -X ZE, USED BY SOME NON-BINARY GENDERED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF.
utt_0014 utt 71.19 75.93 -X IN SOME CASES WE USE THE SAME WORD FOR TWO DIFFERENT PARADIGMS.
utt_0015 utt 75.93 83.06 -X FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE HER FOR BOTH THE OBJECT AND DEPENDENT POSSESSIVES.
utt_0016 utt 83.22 87.83 -X AND WE USE HIS FOR BOTH THE DEPENDENT AND INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVES.
utt_0017 utt 89.17 94.33 -X HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHE/HER/HERS,
utt_0018 utt 95.73 100.41 -X HE/HIM/HIS AND THEY/THEM/THEIR/THEIRS BEFORE?
utt_0022 utt 114.13 125.85 -X INDEPENDENT POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IN ENGLISH, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONLY PRONOUN THAT ENCODES TWO LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS: THE POSSESSED AND THE POSSESSOR.
utt_0024 utt 125.88 134.81 -X SO FOR PEOPLE WHO USE “HERS” AND “THEIRS” AS PART OF THEIR GENDER DIVERSITY, YOU KNOW
utt_0025 utt 134.81 141.63 -X IT IS IMPORTANT FOR APPLICATIONS TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THEM AS PRONOUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
utt_0026 utt 141.63 145.98 -X UNFORTUNATELY, FOR MORE THAN twenty YEARS, EVERY MAJOR STATE OF THE
utt_0028 utt 149.21 151.01 -X THERE WAS NO SUCH ERROR FOR HIS.
utt_0029 utt 152.60 160.51 -X WE CREATE A NEW DATASET IN UNIVERSAL DEPENDENCIES FORMAT WHICH HAS HERS, HIS, AND THEIRS IN DIFFERENT SYNTACTIC CONFIGURATIONS.
utt_0031 utt 160.67 165.90 -X SINCE THIS WAS RELEASED, ALL OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL PARSERS NOW RECOGNIZE THESE PRONOUNS
utt_0032 utt 166.17 169.54 -X AND ANY FUTURE TECHNOLOGY BUILT ON THIS DATASET SHOULD AS WELL.
utt_0033 utt 169.76 173.86 -X SO HAVING TALKED ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH SYNTACTIC PARSERS AND PART-OF-SPEECH TAGGERS,
utt_0034 utt 173.92 176.67 -X WE NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION TO LANGUAGE MODELS.
utt_0035 utt 176.67 178.75 -X SPECIFICALLY, TO MASKED LANGUAGE MODELS.
utt_0036 utt 178.75 184.19 -X SO, WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE PREFERENCE FOR HIS VS THEIRS VS HERS.
utt_0037 utt 184.19 187.84 -X WE EXTEND KURITA ET AL. COMPARING THE SOFTMAX RATIOS.
utt_0038 utt 188.67 190.82 -X WE EXTEND IT IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS.
utt_0039 utt 190.97 195.78 -X THEY USE TWO TEMPLATE SENTENCES AND WE ARE USING THE fifty-seven NEW SENTENCES.
utt_0040 utt 195.84 198.72 -X AND WE HAVE THE MODEL ITSELF SUGGEST THE NOUNS,
utt_0041 utt 199.26 203.52 -X IN ORDER TO AVOID THE SITUATION WHERE SOME OF THESE NOUNS MIGHT BE PATHOLOGICAL IN THE MODEL.
utt_0042 utt 203.52 206.82 -X AND THEN WE COMPARE MODEL RATIOS IN THE TRAINING DATA.
utt_0043 utt 206.85 209.78 -X IN THE RESULTS REPORTED HERE, THIS IS IN
utt_0044 utt 210.40 215.62 -X ENGLISH UNCASED BERT MODEL, BUT THESE APPLY EQUALLY TO OTHER LANGUAGE MODELS AS WELL.
utt_0045 utt 215.87 218.24 -X ALL THIS CODE IS OPEN SOURCE IF YOU GO TO THAT URL.
utt_0046 utt 218.24 221.32 -X SO, LET'S LOOK AT THIS IN MORE DETAIL.
utt_0047 utt 221.32 223.08 -X FIRST, WE MASK THE ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0048 utt 223.08 225.99 -X SO INSTEAD OF THE CAR IS HERS, THE [MASK] IS HERS.
utt_0050 utt 229.79 233.00 -X AND WE IMPLEMENT BAYESIAN DEEP LEARNING.
utt_0051 utt 233.00 241.22 -X SO, THIS IS DROPOUTS AT INFERENCE TIME, REPEATING THE INFERENCE AND BECAUSE THOSE DROPOUTS ARE AT INFERENCE TIME IT GENERATES DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0053 utt 241.54 245.03 -X THIS GENERATED one hundred and four DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES IN TOTAL.
utt_0054 utt 245.06 248.97 -X SOME WERE CONCRETE ATTRIBUTES LIKE CAMERA AND HOUSE AND WORLD.
utt_0055 utt 248.97 251.78 -X SOME WERE ABSTRACT, LIKE “NIGHT” AND “INSTINCTS”.
utt_0056 utt 251.78 262.51 -X AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE one thousandS OF COMBINATIONS OF THESE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES AND THE INITIAL SENTENCES WITH THE PRONOUNS IN DIFFERENT SYNTACTIC POSITIONS.
utt_0059 utt 268.97 270.73 -X MORE THAN THE OTHER PRONOUNS.
utt_0061 utt 275.01 278.41 -X AND NONE WERE PREDICTED AS MORE LIKELY TO BE THEIRS.
utt_0062 utt 279.49 282.19 -X SO, LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THESE EXAMPLES HERE.
utt_0063 utt 282.19 285.36 -X SO, THESE ARE THE one hundred and four ATTRIBUTES COMPARED TO THE TRAINING DATA.
utt_0064 utt 286.73 291.02 -X THE BROWN BARS HERE REPRESENT THE RATIOS OF THE MODEL PREDICTIONS.
utt_0065 utt 291.02 295.63 -X SO, THE SOFTMAX, IN THIS CASE OF THE BINARY COMPARISON OF HIS COMPARED TO HERS.
utt_0066 utt 296.46 303.50 -X THE SENTENCE RATIOS ARE THE NUMBER OF SENTENCES CONTAINING THAT ATTRIBUTE AND OTHER WORDS INDICATING GENDER,
utt_0068 utt 303.66 308.40 -X WHETHER THAT THESE PRONOUNS OR WORDS LIKE MALE AND FEMALE, MAN AND WOMAN, ETC.
utt_0069 utt 308.91 314.06 -X AND THE POSSESSIVE RATIOS ARE THE NUMBER OF SENTENCES IN THE TRAINING DATA
utt_0070 utt 314.47 316.69 -X WHICH CONTAIN POSSESSIVE CONSTRUCTIONS.
utt_0071 utt 317.67 321.26 -X TO GO INTO A CONCRETE EXAMPLE HERE, IF YOU LOOK AT BABY HERE,
utt_0072 utt 321.26 324.18 -X WHICH I THINK IS THE FIFTH ONE DOWN ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE,
utt_0073 utt 324.18 327.95 -X WE CAN SEE THAT IT IS BIASED TOWARDS HERS IN THE TRAINING DATA.
utt_0074 utt 328.30 331.26 -X SO, IN THE TRAINING DATA, SENTENCES LIKE
utt_0075 utt 331.31 335.18 -X HER BABY ARE FIVE TIMES MORE FREQUENT THAN HIS BABY.
utt_0076 utt 336.08 341.90 -X HOWEVER, WHEN WE ARE PREDICTING SENTENCES LIKE THE BABY IS HIS OR THE BABY IS HERS,
utt_0077 utt 342.06 346.26 -X THE MODEL IS MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO PREDICT THE BABY IS HIS
utt_0078 utt 346.70 350.82 -X SO, THIS BIAS TOWARDS HIS IN THE MODEL PREDICTIONS
utt_0079 utt 351.69 355.31 -X CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THE TRAINING DATA ALONE.
utt_0080 utt 355.31 359.44 -X WE WOULD EXPECT THE BIAS TO GO THE OTHER WAY, ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL.
utt_0081 utt 359.82 366.26 -X SO, TO INVESTIGATE THE BIAS FURTHER, WE GENERATED SENTENCES WITH THE PRONOUN UNMASKED,
utt_0084 utt 374.13 377.49 -6.6016 BUT NEVER IN SENTENCES LIKE THE CITY IS HERS OR THE CITY IS HIS,
