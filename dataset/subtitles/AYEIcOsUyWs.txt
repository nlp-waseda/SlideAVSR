utt_0000 utt 0.81 11.76 -X HELLO, MY NAME IS KAYO YIN AND TODAY I WILL PRESENT OUR POSITION PAPER ON INCLUDING SIGNED LANGUAGES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.
utt_0002 utt 11.76 23.09 -X TO BEGIN, SIGNED LANGUAGES ARE FULLY-FLEDGED NATURAL LANGUAGES, EXPRESSED THROUGH HAND SHAPES AND MOVEMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER CUES SUCH AS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND BODY POSITIONS.
utt_0004 utt 23.09 30.29 -X THEY ARE INDEPENDENT OF SPOKEN LANGUAGES, THAT IS, AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE IS NOT A “SIGNED VERSION OF ENGLISH”,
utt_0005 utt 30.29 38.99 -X AND THEY ARE AT LEAST AS CAPABLE AS SPOKEN LANGUAGES IN ALL MANNERS OF COMMUNICATION, LINGUISTIC OR SOCIAL.
utt_0006 utt 39.15 46.23 -X THERE ARE AROUND two hundred DOCUMENTED SIGNED LANGUAGES AND AN ESTIMATED seventy MILLION DEAF PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.
utt_0007 utt 46.23 50.90 -X THEY ARE ALSO THE PRIMARY AND PREFERRED MEANS OF COMMUNICATION FOR DEAF COMMUNITIES,
utt_0008 utt 50.93 55.32 -X AMONG THEMSELVES AND WHEN INTERACTING WITH NON-SIGNING COMMUNITIES.
utt_0009 utt 57.01 65.88 -X WHILE ADVANCES IN NLP GAVE RISE TO USEFUL LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS AUTOMATED TRANSLATION AND VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS IN LANGUAGES SUCH AS ENGLISH,
utt_0011 utt 66.70 71.86 -X ALL OF THESE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING SYSTEMS EXPECT TEXT OR SPEECH AS THE INPUT
utt_0012 utt 72.46 76.44 -X AND THIS EXCLUDES ALL SIGNERS FROM MODERN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES.
utt_0013 utt 76.85 86.01 -X THIS LIMITS THE POSSIBILITIES OF TECHNOLOGY AND RISKS FURTHER SUPPRESSING SIGNING IN FAVOR OF SPOKEN LANGUAGES.
utt_0014 utt 86.01 91.67 -X WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES ACCESSIBLE TO SIGNERS AS WELL,
utt_0015 utt 91.67 98.55 -X SO THAT EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM TECHNOLOGY BY USING THEIR PREFERRED LANGUAGE.
utt_0016 utt 98.71 111.99 -X SO WHO IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING? WELL, TO DATE, RESEARCH ON SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING HAS BEEN MAINLY LEAD BY THE COMPUTER VISION COMMUNITY, WITH LITTLE INVOLVEMENT FROM THE NLP COMMUNITY.
utt_0018 utt 111.99 122.65 -X AND THIS IS NOT UNREASONABLE, GIVEN THAT A DECADE AGO, WE LACKED THE VISUAL PROCESSING TOOLS TO HANDLE SIGNED LANGUAGE VIDEOS BEFORE BEING ABLE TO DO FURTHER MODELING.
utt_0021 utt 132.18 139.99 -X THIS LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT THE TOOLS AND THEORIES USED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING ARE CRUCIAL TO PROCESS SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0022 utt 139.99 145.27 -X AND GIVEN THE RECENT ADVANCES IN COMPUTER VISION THAT ENABLES US TO PROCESS VIDEOS,
utt_0023 utt 145.27 153.85 -X WE ARGUE THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO INCORPORATE LINGUISTIC INSIGHT INTO SIGNED LANGUAGE MODELING AS WELL.
utt_0024 utt 153.85 157.72 -X TO INVITE THE NLP COMMUNITY TO INCLUDE SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0025 utt 157.85 164.67 -X OUR PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SIGNED LANGUAGES AND THE CURRENT STATE OF SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING.
utt_0026 utt 164.82 171.77 -X OUR PAPER STARTS BY GIVING AN INTRODUCTION TO SIGN LANGUAGE LINGUISTICS, INCLUDING ITS PHONOLOGY, SIMULANEITY,
utt_0027 utt 172.37 176.47 -X HOW REFERENCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND GROUNDED IN SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0028 utt 176.69 181.08 -X AND FINGERSPELLING IN SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0029 utt 181.08 188.76 -X NEXT, WE COVER DIFFERENT EXISTING WAYS TO REPRESENT SIGNED LANGUAGE DATA WHICH INCLUDES VIDEOS, POSE ESTIMATIONS,
utt_0031 utt 188.98 192.96 -X VARIOUS NOTATION SYSTEMS AS WELL AS GLOSSES.
utt_0032 utt 195.13 199.16 -X OUR PAPER ALSO PRESENTS EXISTING SIGNED LANGUAGE RESOURCES
utt_0033 utt 199.32 203.26 -X SUCH AS BILINGUAL DICTIONARIES, FINGERSPELLING CORPORA
utt_0034 utt 203.51 207.42 -X AND ISOLATED SIGNS AS WELL AS CONTINUOUS SIGNS CORPORA.
utt_0035 utt 207.83 214.56 -X SO PLEASE DO CHECK OUT OUR PAPER FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE TOPICS.
utt_0036 utt 214.56 221.37 -X THEN, OUR PAPER SURVEYS THE CURRENT TASKS IN SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING AS WELL AS THE CURRENT STATE OF ITS MODELLING.
utt_0037 utt 221.37 227.36 -X SO FIRST WE HAVE SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION WHICH IS TO DETECT WHEN SOMEBODY IS SIGNING IN A VIDEO, OR NOT.
utt_0038 utt 228.09 232.06 -X AND THEN, IDENTIFYING THE LANGUAGE THAT IS BEING SIGNED IN THE VIDEO,
utt_0039 utt 232.67 236.29 -X OR SEGMENTING SIGN LANGUAGE VIDEOS INTO MEANINGFUL UNITS,
utt_0040 utt 236.95 242.85 -X RECOGNIZING SIGN GLOSSES, THAT IS GENERATING A SIGN-BY-SIGN TRANSCRIPTION, FROM A VIDEO,
utt_0041 utt 243.00 246.11 -X AND TRANSLATING SIGNS INTO A SPOKEN LANGUAGE,
utt_0042 utt 246.87 251.45 -X AS WELL AS PRODUCING A SIGNING AVATAR FROM A SPOKEN LANGUAGE INPUT.
utt_0043 utt 253.31 260.06 -X HOWEVER, CURRENT APPROACHES OFTEN DO NOT RELY MUCH ON THEORIES OF SIGNED LANGUAGE LINGUISTICS,
utt_0044 utt 260.06 266.59 -X OR NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS THAT MAY HELP TO ADDRESS THESE TASKS MORE EFFECTIVELY.
utt_0045 utt 266.75 274.02 -X YOU CAN FIND MORE DETAILS ON THE DIFFERENT EXISTING MODELS AND THEIR LIMITATIONS IN OUR PAPER!
utt_0046 utt 274.02 283.62 -X WE FIND THAT SEVERAL LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING METHODS MOSTLY STEM FROM A LACK OF EXPLORING THE LINGUISTIC POSSIBILITIES OF SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0048 utt 283.93 290.63 -X SO WE WOULD THEREFORE LIKE TO OUTLINE HOW EXACTLY THE NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING COMMUNITY CAN GET INVOLVED,
utt_0049 utt 290.63 296.64 -X AND WE NOW LAY A ROADMAP OF OPEN CHALLENGES TO TACKLE.
utt_0050 utt 296.64 300.71 -X FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS A BOTTLENECK IN SIGNED LANGUAGE REPRESENTATION.
utt_0051 utt 300.99 308.13 -X THE VAST MAJORITY OF NLP MODELS EXPECT A DISCRETE REPRESENTATION OF THE INPUT TEXT OR SPEECH.
utt_0052 utt 308.32 316.99 -X WE THEREFORE NEED A WAY TO REPRESENT SIGNED LANGUAGE DATA WITH GOOD EFFICIENCY AND MINIMAL INFORMATION LOSS AS WELL.
utt_0053 utt 316.99 322.34 -X CURRENT APPROACHES OFTEN USE GLOSSING AS AN INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION TO ACHIEVE THIS.
utt_0054 utt 322.66 333.32 -X HOWEVER, LINEAR STREAMS OF GLOSSES CANNOT FULLY CAPTURE THE SIMULTANEITY OF THE MULTIPLE VISUAL CUES AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF SIGNED LANGUAGES,
utt_0055 utt 333.32 336.26 -X WHICH RESULTS IN AN INEVITABLE INFORMATION LOSS.
utt_0056 utt 336.86 339.88 -X GLOSS ANNOTATIONS ARE ALSO LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC,
utt_0057 utt 339.88 343.81 -X AND THEY LACK A STANDARD BETWEEN DIFFERENT DATASETS AND PROJECTS,
utt_0058 utt 343.81 349.32 -X WHICH LIMITS DATA SHARING AND GROUPING, AND ADDS OVERHEAD DURING THEIR MODELING.
utt_0059 utt 349.32 354.05 -X THEREFORE WE URGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF AN EFFICIENT,
utt_0060 utt 354.05 362.85 -X AS WELL AS A UNIVERSAL AND STANDARDIZED METHOD TO REPRESENT SIGNED LANGUAGES FOR NLP MODELING.
utt_0061 utt 362.85 370.79 -X NEXT, WE BELIEVE THAT DEVELOPING KNOWN NLP PIPELINES FOR SIGNED LANGUAGES WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO MODEL THEM.
utt_0062 utt 371.17 376.23 -X MOREOVER, EVEN THOUGH SIGNED AND SPOKEN LANGUAGES ARE EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT MODALITIES,
utt_0063 utt 376.32 379.33 -X THEY BOTH EXPRESS THE GRAMMAR OF NATURAL LANGUAGES,
utt_0064 utt 379.33 384.65 -X AND FUNDAMENTAL THEORIES OF NLP CAN BE EXTENDED TO SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0065 utt 384.65 395.43 -X WE THEREFORE ENCOURAGE DEVELOPING CORE NLP TOOLS FOR SIGNED LANGUAGES SUCH AS SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS, POS TAGGERS, NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION AND COREFERENCE RESOLUTION
utt_0067 utt 395.52 403.56 -X WHICH ARE ALL VALUABLE TOOLS THAT OFTEN LAY THE FOUNDATION OF HIGHER-LEVEL NLP SYSTEMS.
utt_0068 utt 403.56 407.78 -X ALTHOUGH THESE TASKS HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY STUDIED FOR SOME SPOKEN LANGUAGES,
utt_0069 utt 407.91 417.42 -X IN THE VISUAL MODALITY OF SIGNED LANGUAGES, THEY POSE INTERESTING NEW CHALLENGES WHICH WE DISCUSS FURTHER IN OUR PAPER.
utt_0070 utt 417.42 426.79 -X WE ALSO ENCOURAGE THE COLLABORATION AND EXCHANGE OF IDEAS BETWEEN MULTIMODAL NLP RESEARCHERS AND SIGN LANGUAGE PROCESSING RESEARCHERS.
utt_0071 utt 426.79 432.14 -X WE BELIEVE THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, THE THEORIES AND METHODS TO PROCESS MULTIMODAL MESSAGES
utt_0072 utt 432.23 438.22 -X CAN ALSO ENHANCE THE JOINT MODELING OF VISION AND LANGUAGE IN SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0073 utt 438.22 444.49 -X AND ON THE OTHER HAND, MEANING IN SPOKEN LANGUAGES IS NOT ONLY CONVEYED THROUGH SPEECH OR TEXT ALONE,
utt_0074 utt 444.49 448.04 -X BUT ALSO THROUGH THE VISUAL MODALITY TO SOME EXTENT,
utt_0075 utt 448.39 456.65 -X SO STUDYING SIGNED LANGUAGES MAY GIVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MODEL CO-SPEECH GESTURES, SPATIAL DISCOURSE RELATIONS,
utt_0076 utt 456.65 462.96 -X AND CONCEPTUAL GROUNDING OF LANGUAGE THROUGH VISION FOR SPOKEN LANGUAGES AS WELL.
utt_0077 utt 462.96 470.57 -X BY WORKING ON SIGNED LANGUAGES, WE BELIEVE THE NLP COMMUNITY WILL GAIN A MORE HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE ON NATURAL LANGUAGES.
utt_0078 utt 473.06 475.50 -X NOW, TO TRAIN DEPLOYABLE MODELS,
utt_0079 utt 475.50 481.00 -X WE NEED LARGE ENOUGH DATASETS THAT ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE REAL WORLD.
utt_0080 utt 481.00 485.48 -X HOWEVER, SIGNED LANGUAGES HAVE VERY LITTLE LABELED AND UNLABELED DATA,
utt_0081 utt 485.48 490.92 -X WHICH PLACES ALL SIGNED LANGUAGES IN THE CLASS OF LANGUAGES WITH THE LOWEST RESOURCE.
utt_0082 utt 492.23 496.24 -X MOREOVER, TO MITIGATE THE CHALLENGES OF SCARCE RESOURCES,
utt_0083 utt 496.30 503.95 -X POPULAR SIGN LANGUAGE DATASETS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR RESEARCH ARE OFTEN RESTRICTED TO A SMALL DOMAIN, SUCH AS WEATHER FORECASTS,
utt_0085 utt 503.95 506.61 -X AND THEY HAVE A SMALL VOCABULARY SIZE.
utt_0086 utt 508.17 511.63 -X AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SIGNED LANGUAGE DATA IN THE WILD,
utt_0087 utt 511.95 515.82 -X COLLECTED DATA ARE OFTEN FILMED IN STUDIO CONDITIONS,
utt_0088 utt 515.91 519.41 -X OR TAKEN FROM INTERPRETATIONS OF SPOKEN UTTERANCES,
utt_0089 utt 519.79 526.45 -X AND IT IS ALSO HARD TO FIND A DIVERSE SIGNER DEMOGRAPHIC OR NATIVE SIGNERS IN THESE DATASETS.
utt_0090 utt 526.96 529.42 -X THEREFORE, WITH THE CURRENT RESOURCES,
utt_0091 utt 529.42 537.74 -X WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OUR MODELS ON DATA THAT CAN FULLY CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0092 utt 539.82 548.34 -X OBTAINING SIGNED LANGUAGE DATA IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT AS DATA COLLECTION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS IN RECRUITING AND RECORDING.
utt_0094 utt 549.48 554.38 -X ANNOTATION OF SIGNED LANGUAGES ALSO REQUIRE A SPECIFIC SET OF KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS,
utt_0095 utt 554.38 560.05 -X WHICH MAKES RECRUITING OR TRAINING QUALIFIED ANNOTATORS VERY CHALLENGING.
utt_0096 utt 560.05 571.03 -X AND COLLECTING AND ANNOTATING SIGNED LANGUAGES IS A LABORIOUS TASK THAT MAY TAKE UP TO six hundred MINUTES OF COLLECTION AND ANNOTATION TO OBTAIN JUST one SINGLE MINUTE OF LABELED DATA.
utt_0098 utt 572.24 579.51 -X WE THUS ALSO ENCOURAGE RESEARCH ON TOOLS THAT CAN AUTOMATE, FACILITATE AND ACCELERATE PARTS OF THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS,
utt_0099 utt 579.73 583.76 -X AS WELL AS MORE INITIATIVES TO OBTAIN SIGNED LANGUAGE DATASETS.
utt_0100 utt 585.61 593.97 -X FINALLY, WHEN RESEARCHING SIGNED LANGUAGES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEP IN MIND WHO THIS TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BENEFIT, AND WHAT THEY NEED.
utt_0101 utt 594.45 603.44 -X SIGNED LANGUAGES BELONG TO SIGNING COMMUNITIES, AND AS RESEARCHERS, WE MUST NOT EXPLOIT THEIR LANGUAGES AS A COMMODITY.
utt_0102 utt 603.44 611.19 -X TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, SEVERAL PREVIOUS EFFORTS RELEASED PRODUCTS SUCH AS GLOVES THAT ARE MARKETED TO PERFORM SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION,
utt_0103 utt 611.50 618.23 -X BUT ACTUALLY THEY ONLY RECOGNIZE FINGERSPELLING AND A FEW ISOLATED SIGNS AT BEST.
utt_0104 utt 618.23 620.47 -X SO THE PROBLEM OF SUCH PRODUCT IS THAT,
utt_0105 utt 620.47 628.53 -X FIRST OF ALL, THIS DISREGARDS SIGNER’S PREFERENCES WHO OFTEN DO NOT WISH TO WEAR ADDITIONAL SENSORS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY NON SIGNERS.
utt_0106 utt 629.27 640.66 -X THIS ALSO PROMOTES MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT SIGNED LANGUAGES, THAT THEY ARE EXPRESSED SOLELY THROUGH THE HANDS, OR CONSIST ENTIRELY OF FINGERSPELLING.
utt_0107 utt 640.85 648.05 -X IN ORDER TO AVOID SUCH MISTAKES, TO AVOID MAKING FALSE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SIGNED LANGUAGES AND THE NEEDS OF SIGNING COMMUNITIES,
utt_0108 utt 648.18 652.82 -X AND TO BE ABLE TO CREATE WELL-DESIGNED TECHNOLOGY WITH A POSITIVE IMPACT,
utt_0109 utt 652.95 659.96 -X IT IS ESSENTIAL TO COLLABORATE WITH SIGNING COMMUNITIES AND INCLUDE THEM AS A LEADING VOICE TOWARDS RESEARCH.
utt_0110 utt 661.27 667.29 -X WE ENCOURAGE THE CREATION OF A LONG-TERM COLLABORATION ENVIRONMENT BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND SIGNERS,
utt_0111 utt 667.38 678.42 -X AND IN OUR PAPER WE SUGGEST SEVERAL WAYS TO CONNECT WITH SIGNING COMMUNITIES FOR RESEARCHERS INTERESTED IN WORKING ON SIGNED LANGUAGES.
utt_0112 utt 678.42 687.86 -X TO CONCLUDE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE NLP COMMUNITY IS CURRENTLY WELL-POSITIONED TO BRING THE LINGUISTIC INSIGHT NEEDED FOR BETTER SIGNED LANGUAGE PROCESSING,
utt_0114 utt 687.92 699.16 -X AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE HOPE TO SEE INCREASED EFFORTS IN COLLECTING SIGNED LANGUAGE RESOURCES AND DEVELOPING MODELS WHILE BUILDING A STRONG COLLABORATION WITH SIGNING COMMUNITIES.
utt_0116 utt 699.41 702.20 -3.7895 WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION!
