utt_0000 utt 1.45 9.30 -X WHILE COMPUTER VISION HAS SEEN MUCH PROGRESS IN SEGMENTING OBJECTS, VISUAL EFFECTS SUCH AS SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS ARE TYPICALLY IGNORED.
utt_0001 utt 9.30 13.97 -X HOWEVER, CAPTURING THESE VISUAL EFFECTS IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORT VIDEO EDITING APPLICATIONS.
utt_0005 utt 31.19 41.24 -X NOTICE IN THE ORIGINAL VIDEO THAT THE DOG WALKS IN FRONT OF THE PERSON'S SHADOW AND OCCLUDES IT, BUT IN THE PERSON'S OUTPUT LAYER, THAT SHADOW IS COMPLETED BY OUR METHOD QUITE REALISTICALLY.
utt_0006 utt 41.24 51.06 -X WE CALL THIS OUTPUT LAYER AN “OMNIMATTE”, AND DEFINE IT AS A MATTE CONTAINING AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND ALL ITS CORRELATED EFFECTS (SUCH AS SHADOWS, REFLECTIONS, OR ATTACHED OBJECTS).
utt_0008 utt 55.93 60.06 -X HERE WE’VE REMOVED BOTH THE PERSON AND THEIR SHADOW, LEAVING ONLY THE DOG.
utt_0013 utt 80.12 89.79 -X IN FURTHER DETAIL, WE’RE GIVEN AN INPUT VIDEO AND OBJECT SEGMENTS. WE FIRST PRECOMPUTE THE OPTICAL FLOW USING RAFT, AND MASK THE FLOW BY EACH OBJECT SEGMENT.
utt_0014 utt 89.79 97.82 -X THE SEGMENTS AND THE FLOW ARE INPUT TO OUR MODEL, WHICH HAS A UNET ARCHITECTURE. WE PREDICT LAYERS INDIVIDUALLY IN A SEPARATE FEED-FORWARD PASS.
utt_0015 utt 97.82 105.09 -X OUR OUTPUTS ARE THE RGBA LAYERS IN ADDITION TO THE REFINED FLOW FOR EACH LAYER, WHICH WE USE IN A TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY LOSS TERM.
utt_0016 utt 105.72 110.79 -X WE PREDICT ALL LAYERS SEPARATELY, AS WELL AS A BACKGROUND LAYER USING THE SAME NETWORK.
utt_0020 utt 128.19 137.09 -X WE TRAIN THE NETWORK TO MINIMIZE RECONSTRUCTION LOSS ON THE WHOLE VIDEO. WE TAKE THE PREDICTED LAYERS AND PERFORM BACK-TO-FRONT COMPOSITING TO RECONSTRUCT THE INPUT FRAME.
utt_0023 utt 153.60 159.91 -X WE ADDITIONALLY HAVE TWO LOSS TERMS TO ENCOURAGE TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY. PLEASE SEE THE PAPER FOR DETAILS.
utt_0028 utt 191.75 198.48 -X IN THIS TWO-LAYER EXAMPLE, OUR MODEL LARGELY MANAGES TO SEPARATE THE SHADOW OF THE SOCCER BALL FROM THE SHADOW OF THE PERSON.
utt_0029 utt 198.73 203.25 -X HERE WE SHOW RENDERINGS OF THE VIDEO WITH EACH OMNIMATTE LAYER INDIVIDUALLY.
utt_0030 utt 204.88 212.11 -X OUR OMNIMATTES CAN ALSO BE USED AS INPUT TO OTHER VIDEO EDITING METHODS, SUCH AS VIDEO COMPLETION FOR OBJECT REMOVAL.
utt_0031 utt 212.40 219.63 -X IN THE MIDDLE COLUMN WE SHOW THE INPUT MASK WHICH WAS MANUALLY LABELED TO INCLUDE THE SHADOW, AND RESULT OF A VIDEO COMPLETION METHOD, FGVC.
utt_0032 utt 220.37 226.48 -X TO THE RIGHT OF THAT IS OUR AUTOMATIC MASK, WHICH WE OBTAIN BY THRESHOLDING THE PREDICTED ALPHA CHANNEL OF THE OMNIMATTE.
utt_0033 utt 226.70 235.06 -X INPUTTING THIS MASK TO THE FGVC METHOD YIELDS A SIMILAR REMOVAL RESULT, DESPITE OUR INPUT MASK BEING OBTAINED AUTOMATICALLY RATHER THAN MANUALLY.
utt_0034 utt 235.66 243.45 -X HERE WE’LL SHOW AN EXAMPLE WHERE EXISTING TOOLS FAIL TO PERFORM OBJECT REMOVAL. HERE IS AN INPUT VIDEO OF PEOPLE JUMPING ON TRAMPOLINES.
utt_0035 utt 244.24 254.87 -X IF WE WANT TO REMOVE PEOPLE USING EXISTING TOOLS, WE CAN FIRST SEGMENT THE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO REMOVE, AND THEN INPUT THOSE SEGMENTS INTO A VIDEO COMPLETION METHOD TO REMOVE THE OTHER PEOPLE.
utt_0036 utt 254.87 260.63 -X HOWEVER, EVEN THOUGH WE’VE REMOVED THE PEOPLE, WE’RE STILL LEFT WITH THEIR SHADOWS AND THEIR TRAMPOLINE DEFORMATIONS.
utt_0037 utt 261.43 269.27 -X WHAT WE WANT IS FOR EVERYONE, ALONG WITH THEIR SHADOWS AND TRAMPOLINE DEFORMATIONS REMOVED, WHICH WE CAN OBTAIN USING OUR OMNIMATTES.
utt_0038 utt 270.10 278.30 -X HERE WE VISUALIZE EACH OMNIMATTE LAYER IN A DIFFERENT COLOR. NOTICE EACH PERSON’S OMNIMATTE ALSO CONTAINS THEIR SHADOW AND TRAMPOLINE DEFORMATIONS.
utt_0039 utt 279.51 285.08 -X LASTLY, HERE ARE SOME FUN EDITING EFFECTS YOU CAN CREATE WITH THE PREDICTED OMNIMATTES, LIKE STROBOSCOPY.
utt_0040 utt 285.21 289.53 -X NOTICE THE SHADOW IS REALISTICALLY DUPLICATED ALONG WITH THE HORSE AND RIDER.
utt_0041 utt 290.55 297.85 -X ON THIS INPUT VIDEO, WE DEMONSTRATE A COLOR POP EFFECT TO CREATE EMPHASIS, BY COLORIZING ONLY THE FLAMINGO AND ITS REFLECTION.
utt_0042 utt 299.10 300.45 -0.7393 THANKS FOR WATCHING!
