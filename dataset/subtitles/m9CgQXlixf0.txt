utt_0000 utt 0.37 10.51 -X MY NAME IS JUSTIN LIM, AND TODAY I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR WORK: FINDING REGIONS OF HETEROGENEITY IN DECISION MAKING VIA EXPECTED CONDITIONAL COVARIANCE. THIS WORK IS EQUALLY CONTRIBUTED
utt_0002 utt 10.51 19.31 -X BY MYSELF, CHRISTINA JI, AND MICHAEL OBERST AND IS JOINTLY AUTHORED WITH SAUL BLECKER AND LEORA HORWITZ FROM NYU AS WELL AS DAVID SONTAG FROM MIT.
utt_0004 utt 22.35 33.87 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE CONSIDER DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND OBSERVE THAT INDIVIDUALS OFTEN MAKE DIFFERENT DECISIONS EVEN WHEN FACED WITH THE SAME CONTEXT. SO FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPOSE WE'RE IN A
utt_0006 utt 33.87 45.11 -X COURTROOM, AND THERE'S A CASE THAT'S AWAITING JUDGMENT. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES THE DECISION TO EITHER ACQUIT OR TO CONVICT ON THIS CASE DEPEND ON THE JUDGE THAT MAKES THE DECISION? FOR EXAMPLE,
utt_0008 utt 45.11 50.29 -X JUDGE A ON THE LEFT MAY DECIDE TO ACQUIT, WHILE JUDGE B ON THE RIGHT MAY DECIDE TO CONVICT.
utt_0009 utt 52.05 56.82 -X SUCH HETEROGENEITY IN DECISION MAKING IS A WELL-DOCUMENTED PHENOMENON IN REAL LIFE.
utt_0010 utt 56.91 62.51 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IN A LEGAL CONTEXT, HETEROGENEITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN DECISIONS ON BAIL,
utt_0011 utt 62.61 68.50 -X JUVENILE INCARCERATION, AS WELL AS THE USE OF ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION.
utt_0012 utt 68.50 73.84 -X IN THE MEDICAL CONTEXT ,HETEROGENEITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN DECISIONS ON SURGICAL INTERVENTION,
utt_0013 utt 73.84 76.76 -X AS WELL AS THE LENGTH OF A PATIENT'S STAY IN THE HOSPITAL.
utt_0014 utt 78.54 86.07 -X CONCEPTUALLY, WHAT WE WANT TO SOLVE IN THIS PAPER IS AS FOLLOWS: GIVEN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS,
utt_0015 utt 86.07 98.10 -X IN WHICH CASES DOES CHANGING THE DECISION MAKER RESULT IN A DIFFERENT DECISION? ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WILL ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING GUIDELINES,
utt_0017 utt 98.10 102.87 -X WHICH COULD LEAD TO FAIRER DECISIONS AND BETTER OUTCOMES FOR STAKEHOLDERS.
utt_0018 utt 103.06 109.27 -X IN OUR PAPER, WE USE THE LANGUAGE OF CAUSAL INFERENCE TO APPROACH THIS PROBLEM.
utt_0019 utt 109.27 117.85 -X AND AS IN ALL CAUSAL INFERENCE PROBLEMS, THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS THAT WE REALLY ONLY OBSERVE ONE JUDGE'S DECISION PER CASE. FOR EXAMPLE,
utt_0021 utt 117.85 126.58 -X IF WE OBSERVE JUDGE A'S DECISION ON SOME CASE, WE DON'T OBSERVE JUDGE B'S DECISION ON THE SAME CASE.
utt_0022 utt 126.58 133.11 -X A SECOND CHALLENGE IN THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE OFTEN HAVE ONLY SPARSE DATA FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKER,
utt_0024 utt 133.23 138.93 -X SO WE MAY HAVE HUNDREDS OF DECISION MAKERS WITH ONLY SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS PER DECISION MAKER.
utt_0025 utt 141.87 145.81 -X IN THIS PAPER, WE TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES AND PROVIDE A FEW CONTRIBUTIONS:
utt_0026 utt 145.81 156.70 -X THE FIRST IS THAT WE FORMALIZE THIS PROBLEM AS A CAUSAL INFERENCE PROBLEM, WHICH IS TO FIND A REGION WHERE THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE DECISION MAKER HAS A LARGE CAUSAL EFFECT ON THE DECISION.
utt_0028 utt 157.36 169.62 -X WE ALSO PROVIDE AN ITERATIVE ALGORITHM TO FIND SUCH A REGION, TOGETHER WITH A GENERALIZATION BOUND. AND IN A SEMI-SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENT, WE SHOW THAT OUR ALGORITHM ACCURATELY RECOVERS
utt_0030 utt 169.62 173.75 -X THE CORRECT REGION OF DISAGREEMENT. AND ON REAL-WORLD MEDICAL DATASETS,
utt_0031 utt 173.75 178.94 -X WE SHOW THAT OUR ALGORITHM RECOVERS VARIATION THAT ALIGNS WITH EXISTING CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE.
utt_0032 utt 181.11 193.11 -X NOW TO BEGIN, LET'S FIRST DEFINE WHAT WE MEAN BY A REGION OF HETEROGENEITY, SO LET'S CONSIDER AN EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE JUDGES THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON TWO TYPES OF CASES:
utt_0034 utt 193.11 199.93 -X MISDEMEANORS AND FELONIES. IN EACH CASE, A JUDGE MAKES A DECISION TO EITHER CONVICT OR TO ACQUIT.
utt_0035 utt 202.01 213.66 -X FOR MISDEMEANOR CASES, SOME JUDGES LIKE THE FIRST AND THIRD JUDGE DECIDE TO CONVICT MOST OF THE TIME, BUT OTHER JUDGES LIKE THE SECOND AND FOURTH JUDGE DECIDE TO ACQUIT MOST OF THE TIME,
utt_0037 utt 213.66 221.79 -X SO THERE IS HETEROGENEITY IN DECISION MAKING BETWEEN JUDGES FOR MISDEMEANOR CASES.
utt_0038 utt 221.79 227.10 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, ALL JUDGES THAT SEE FELONY CASES CONSISTENTLY DECIDE TO CONVICT
utt_0039 utt 227.22 233.11 -X fifty% OF THE TIME. THIS MEANS THAT THERE IS NO HETEROGENEITY IN DECISION MAKING FOR FELONY CASES.
utt_0040 utt 235.41 246.88 -X OUR GOAL IS TO CHARACTERIZE THE REGION OF CASES WHERE THE IDENTITY OF THE DECISION MAKER MAKES A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE ULTIMATE DECISION, AND HERE MISDEMEANOR CASES WOULD
utt_0042 utt 246.88 251.42 -X BELONG TO THE REGION OF HETEROGENEITY, AND THIS REGION IS WHAT WE WANT TO FIND.
utt_0043 utt 253.43 265.21 -X AND THIS ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE ACTUALLY DOES SHOW SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARISE WHEN CONSIDERING SUCH A PROBLEM: FIRSTLY, NOTICE THAT NOT EVERY JUDGE SEES EVERY TYPE OF CASE. THE FIFTH
utt_0045 utt 265.21 271.56 -X AND SIXTH JUDGES NEVER SEE MISDEMEANOR CASES, AND THE FIRST AND SECOND JUDGE NEVER SEE FELONY CASES
utt_0046 utt 273.50 285.25 -X ANOTHER CHALLENGE ARISES WHEN JUDGES DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE SAME TYPES OF MISDEMEANOR CASES, AND THESE DIFFERENCES MAY ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR DECISION MAKING.
utt_0048 utt 286.23 290.14 -X THESE TWO CHALLENGES FALL NATURALLY INTO THE LANGUAGE OF CAUSAL INFERENCE,
utt_0049 utt 290.14 304.89 -X WHICH MOTIVATES THE APPROACH THAT WE TAKE IN THIS PAPER. AND TO DO SO, WE FORMALIZE WHAT WE MEAN BY A DECISION MAKING PROCESS, AND BY THAT, AN AGENT A MAKES A BINARY DECISION Y BASED ON SOME CONTEXT X,
utt_0051 utt 305.15 312.70 -X AND THE ARROWS IN THIS DIAGRAM REFER TO THE DIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THESE VARIABLES.
utt_0052 utt 312.76 321.89 -X NOW THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IN CAUSAL INFERENCE AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE IS THAT WE DON'T OBSERVE ALL THE POTENTIAL DECISIONS OF EVERY AGENT FOR EVERY CONTEXT,
utt_0054 utt 321.98 328.22 -X AND IN PARTICULAR, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DECISION A DIFFERENT AGENT WOULD HAVE MADE IN SOME SITUATION.
utt_0055 utt 328.41 341.66 -X SO TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM WE MAKE TWO ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THE LITERATURE ON CAUSAL EFFECT ESTIMATION: THE FIRST IS CONSISTENCY, WHICH CONNECTS THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF AN AGENT A
utt_0057 utt 341.72 349.50 -X WHICH IS Y OF A TO THE OBSERVED DECISION Y. THE SECOND ASSUMPTION IS NO UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING,
utt_0058 utt 349.50 361.66 -X WHICH SAYS THAT WE OBSERVE ALL THE VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE BOTH THE ASSIGNMENT OF AN AGENT AND THE DECISION ITSELF, AND IN PARTICULAR, IF WE CONSIDER THIS LEFT OVAL--THIS PINK
utt_0060 utt 361.66 366.21 -X OVAL OVER HERE--TO CONTAIN ALL OF THE VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE AGENT ASSIGNMENT,
utt_0061 utt 366.21 371.71 -X AND THIS BLUE OVAL ON THE RIGHT TO CONTAIN ALL THE VARIABLES THAT INFLUENCE THE DECISION ITSELF,
utt_0062 utt 371.87 377.52 -X THEN ASSUMPTION TWO SAYS THAT WE OBSERVE ALL THE VARIABLES THAT LIE IN THE INTERSECTION
utt_0063 utt 377.57 390.88 -X OF THESE TWO OVALS BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE UNION OF THEM. SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE WERE A VARIABLE THAT INFLUENCES A JUDGE'S DECISION BUT DOES NOT INFLUENCE HOW CASES ARE ASSIGNED TO JUDGES,
utt_0065 utt 390.88 399.59 -X THEN ASSUMPTION TWO SAYS THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO OBSERVE THAT VARIABLE.
utt_0066 utt 399.87 410.50 -X WE'VE ALSO HINTED AT THIS BEFORE, BUT WE DON'T MAKE WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE OVERLAP OR POSITIVITY ASSUMPTION, AND HERE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT NOT EVERY AGENT SEES EVERY CONTEXT X,
utt_0068 utt 410.69 417.41 -X OR IN OTHER WORDS NOT EVERY JUDGE SEES EVERY TYPE OF CASE. SO IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH AN ASSUMPTION,
utt_0069 utt 417.41 420.80 -X HOW DO WE STILL COMPARE THE POTENTIAL DECISIONS OF DIFFERENT AGENTS?
utt_0070 utt 421.38 428.45 -X IN THIS PAPER, OUR IDEA IS THAT WE CAN STILL MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SPECIFIC AGENT'S
utt_0071 utt 428.45 441.73 -X DECISION AND THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF A RANDOM AGENT. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS, LET'S CONSIDER--LET'S GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE THAT WE STARTED WITH: SO HERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE JUDGES
utt_0073 utt 441.73 447.27 -X THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON MISDEMEANOR CASES, AND WE WANT TO MEASURE THE BIAS OF A JUDGE A.
utt_0074 utt 448.10 454.98 -X WE DO SO BY CONTRASTING TWO QUANTITIES: THE FIRST IS THE DECISION OF JUDGE A WHICH IS TO CONVICT,
utt_0075 utt 455.58 460.58 -X AND THE SECOND IS THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF A RANDOM BUT VIABLE JUDGE,
utt_0076 utt 460.74 466.25 -X AND HERE JUDGES ONE TO FOUR ARE VIABLE BECAUSE THEY DO SEE MISDEMEANOR CASES,
utt_0077 utt 466.47 481.29 -X BUT JUDGES FIVE TO SIX ARE NOT VIABLE BECAUSE THEY NEVER SEE MISDEMEANOR CASES, AND SO WE CAN'T COMPARE THEIR DECISIONS TO THE DECISIONS OF JUDGE A. HERE WE SEE THAT THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF A
utt_0079 utt 481.29 486.31 -X RANDOM AGENT HAS A LOWER RATE OF CONVICTION WHEN COMPARED TO THE DECISIONS OF JUDGE A,
utt_0080 utt 486.69 492.61 -X SO WE MIGHT SAY THAT MISDEMEANOR CASES BELONG TO THE REGION OF HETEROGENEITY WHICH WE DENOTE AS S.
utt_0081 utt 495.94 507.78 -X IN MATHEMATICAL TERMS, WE DEFINE WHAT WE CALL THE CONDITIONAL RELATIVE AGENT BIAS, WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF AN AGENT A AND THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF A RANDOM
utt_0083 utt 507.78 515.05 -X AGENT WHICH IS Y OF PI OF X, AND THIS RANDOMNESS IS ASSIGNED PROPORTIONALLY BASED ON THE CONTEXT X.
utt_0084 utt 516.42 528.25 -X TO VISUALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS, CONSIDER THIS DIAGRAM ON THE BOTTOM, SO THE X-AXIS HERE IS THE CONTEXT X AND THE Y-AXIS HERE IS THE POTENTIAL DECISION Y. THE UPPER CURVE REPRESENTS
utt_0086 utt 528.25 541.38 -X THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF OUR AGENT A, AND THE LOWER CURVE REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL DECISION OF OUR RANDOM AGENT. WE WANT TO FIND A REGION S THAT IS A SUBSET OF CONTEXT, AND HERE IS REPRESENTED
utt_0088 utt 541.38 554.31 -X AS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO VERTICAL LINES. AND NOW THE CONDITIONAL RELATIVE AGENT BIAS IS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CURVES TAKEN BETWEEN THE TWO VERTICAL LINES.
utt_0090 utt 557.06 572.04 -X NOW THAT WE'VE DEFINED HOW TO MEASURE THE BIAS OF A SPECIFIC AGENT, WE GO ON AND DEFINE A CAUSAL OBJECTIVE THAT CAPTURES AGGREGATE BIAS ACROSS A BINARY GROUPING OF AGENTS WHICH WE DENOTE AS G.
utt_0092 utt 572.45 577.87 -X THIS OBJECTIVE IS CALLED Q, AND IT'S A FUNCTION OF THE REGION S AND THE AGENT GROUPING G.
utt_0093 utt 579.53 594.04 -X NOTICE THAT Q OF S COMMA G IS A WEIGHTED SUM OVER THE CONDITIONAL RELATIVE AGENT BIAS OF AGENTS IN THE GROUPING OR IN OTHER WORDS WHERE G OF A IS EQUAL TO one. NOW WE MAKE THE OBSERVATION THAT FOR
utt_0095 utt 594.04 606.92 -X A GIVEN REGION S THIS OBJECTIVE IS MAXIMIZED BY CHOOSING G OF A TO BE EQUAL TO one WHENEVER THE BIAS OF AGENT A IS NON-NEGATIVE ON S. THIS OBSERVATION ALLOWS US TO REWRITE OUR OBJECTIVE
utt_0097 utt 607.11 613.52 -X AS A MAXIMIZATION OVER JUST THE REGION S, AS IS REPRESENTED HERE IN THIS FINAL OBJECTIVE.
utt_0098 utt 613.83 623.56 -X NOTICE THAT WE'VE ALSO IMPOSED A MINIMUM SIZE CONSTRAINT ON THE SIZE OF S, WHICH IS REPRESENTED HERE BY THE PARAMETER BETA. IN OUR PAPER, WE DISCUSS WHY THIS MINIMUM
utt_0100 utt 623.56 632.56 -X SIZE CONSTRAINT IS NECESSARY AND ALSO PROVIDE A HEURISTIC TO TUNE THIS PARAMETER IN REAL LIFE.
utt_0101 utt 632.71 643.60 -X NOW TO OPTIMIZE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE SHOW IN THE PAPER THAT Q OF S COMMA G CAN BE IDENTIFIED AS AN EXPECTED CONDITIONAL COVARIANCE BETWEEN THE DECISION Y AND THE AGENT GROUPING G.
utt_0103 utt 644.49 649.23 -X THIS ALLOWS US TO IDENTIFY AND ESTIMATE Q OF S COMMA G FROM DATA
utt_0104 utt 649.26 657.97 -X WITHOUT REQUIRING AGENT-SPECIFIC MODELS. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE CAN APPLY OUR METHODS IN SETTINGS WHERE DATA ON INDIVIDUAL AGENTS IS SCARCE,
utt_0106 utt 657.97 664.77 -X WHICH IS THE CASE IN MANY REAL-WORLD DECISION DATA SETS. AND IN OUR PAPER, WE APPLY METHODS
utt_0107 utt 664.78 670.38 -X ON A REAL-WORLD MEDICAL DATA SET WHERE EACH DOCTOR HAS FEWER THAN NINE SAMPLES ON AVERAGE.
utt_0108 utt 672.78 682.80 -X LET'S NOW WALK THROUGH OUR SEMI-SYNTHETIC EXPERIMENT TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT OUR METHODS LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE. SO OUR DATA SET CONSISTS OF RECIDIVISM PREDICTIONS USING THE
utt_0110 utt 682.80 689.71 -X COMPAS DATA SET, WHERE MECHANICAL TURK AGENTS PREDICT RECIDIVISM BASED ON FIVE RISK FACTORS,
utt_0111 utt 689.96 695.38 -X SO WE GENERATE SEMI-SYNTHETIC DATA FOR TWO DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS: IN THE FIRST,
utt_0112 utt 695.38 701.84 -X THE GROUND TRUTH REGION OF HETEROGENEITY IS ALL DRUG POSSESSION CHARGES, AND IN THE SECOND,
utt_0113 utt 701.84 706.32 -X THE REGION CONSISTS OF ALL MISDEMEANOR CHARGES FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF thirty-five.
utt_0114 utt 708.75 719.06 -X WE THEN SAMPLE DECISIONS FROM SYNTHETIC AGENTS, WHICH ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF TWO POLICIES: THE BASE POLICY IS LEARNED ON REAL AGENT PREDICTIONS FROM THE DATA, WHILE
utt_0116 utt 719.06 725.14 -X THE ALTERNATIVE POLICY HAS A SYSTEMATIC PREFERENCE TOWARDS RECIDIVISM IN THE REGION OF HETEROGENEITY.
utt_0117 utt 725.14 733.94 -X HERE ARE OUR RESULTS: THE Y-AXIS IN THESE DIAGRAMS INDICATES THE AUC, WHICH IS
utt_0118 utt 734.64 739.19 -X BASED ON CLASSIFYING WHETHER A SAMPLE IS IN THE TRUE REGION OF HETEROGENEITY.
utt_0119 utt 739.60 751.09 -X THE X-AXIS INDICATES THE NUMBER OF AGENTS IN OUR EXPERIMENT, AND WE FIND THAT OUR ALGORITHM OUTPERFORMS BASELINE METHODS WHEN THERE ARE MANY AGENTS AND WHEN THERE ARE FEW SAMPLES PER AGENT.
utt_0121 utt 753.74 767.92 -X IN OUR PAPER, WE SHOW THAT HETEROGENEITY IN DECISION MAKING CAN BE MEASURED AS A CAUSAL CONTRAST AND SHOW THAT REGIONS OF HETEROGENEITY CAN BE FOUND USING AN ITERATIVE ALGORITHM. FINDING SUCH REGIONS CAN HELP IMPROVE DECISION-MAKING GUIDELINES,
utt_0124 utt 767.92 771.80 -X IMPROVE FAIRNESS, AND LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES. FINALLY,
utt_0125 utt 771.80 776.53 -5.4657 PLEASE COME TO OUR POSTER AND READ OUR PAPER FOR MORE INFORMATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING!
