utt_0000 utt 0.02 4.53 -X HI, MY NAME IS VINCENT AND I AM FROM THE SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING LAB
utt_0002 utt 4.59 6.10 -X IN IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON.
utt_0003 utt 6.60 16.85 -X IN THIS TALK, I WILL BE PRESENTING OUR ICASSP two thousand and twenty PAPER PEVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT IN REVERBERANT ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0005 utt 18.54 21.01 -X THIS IS THE OUTLINE OF MY TALK TODAY.
utt_0006 utt 23.21 28.56 -X THE SINGLE-CHANNEL AND MULTI-CHANNEL SUBSPACE APPROACHES FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT,
utt_0008 utt 28.75 36.18 -X USE AN EVD TO DECORRELATE SPECTRALLY AND SPATIALLY, RESPECTIVELY.
utt_0009 utt 36.18 39.60 -X HOWEVER, AN EVD CAN ONLY DECORRELATE INSTANTANEOUSLY.
utt_0010 utt 41.10 44.88 -X OTHER METHODS TYPICALLY USE THE STFT FOR PROCESSING.
utt_0011 utt 47.57 53.52 -X THIS USES THE DFT TO DIVIDE THE BROADBAND INTO MULTIPLE NARROWBAND SIGNALS.
utt_0013 utt 54.70 61.75 -X HOWEVER, THIS APPROACH LACKS PHASE COHERENCE ACROSS DIFFERENT BANDS AND IGNORES CORRELATION BETWEEN BANDS.
utt_0015 utt 63.05 68.88 -X TO CAPTURE THE SPACE, TIME AND FREQUENCY CORRELATION USING A threeD TENSOR,
utt_0016 utt 70.13 74.29 -X POLYNOMIAL MATRICES ARE INTRODUCED AS AN APPROPRIATE MODEL.
utt_0017 utt 74.29 86.39 -X TO PROCESS THEM, POLYNOMIAL EVD IS USED TO IMPOSE SPATIAL DECORRELATION OVER A RANGE OF TIME SHIFTS WITHOUT INTRODUCING ANY PHASE DISCONTINUITY.
utt_0020 utt 88.02 94.76 -X IN OUR EARLIER WORK, WE PROPOSED A POLYNOMIAL EVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM
utt_0022 utt 94.93 97.62 -X AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED ITS EFFECTIVENESS
utt_0023 utt 98.10 100.82 -X IN ANECHOIC ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0024 utt 100.82 110.07 -X WE HAVE SHOWN THAT ITS PERFORMANCE APPROACHES THE ORACLE MULTI-CHANNEL WIENER FILTER WHICH USES COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEAN SPEECH SIGNAL,
utt_0027 utt 110.19 114.71 -X AND OUR APPROACH DOES NOT INTRODUCE ANY NOTICEABLE ARTIFACTS.
utt_0028 utt 114.80 117.94 -X IN THIS TALK, WE WILL FOCUS ON
utt_0029 utt 118.16 121.11 -X SPEECH ENHANCEMENT IN REVERBERANT ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0030 utt 123.98 131.54 -X CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING SIGNAL MODEL WITH X REPRESENTING THE RECEIVED SIGNALS FROM M SENSORS,
utt_0032 utt 133.49 135.76 -X H IS THE CHANNEL IMPULSE RESPONSE,
utt_0033 utt 137.23 141.43 -X S_zero IS THE ANECHOIC SPEECH SIGNAL THAT IS UNCORRELATED WITH V,
utt_0035 utt 142.23 145.27 -X THE ADDITIVE NOISE SIGNALS AT THE SENSORS.
utt_0036 utt 146.83 155.41 -X ASSUMING STATIONARITY, THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX, RXX, IS COMPUTED USING THE RECEIVED SIGNALS, X.
utt_0037 utt 156.37 159.93 -X MORE SPECIFICALLY, EACH ELEMENT IS
utt_0038 utt 159.95 163.35 -X THE CORRELATION FUNCTION BETWEEN SENSOR PAIRS.
utt_0039 utt 164.21 169.27 -X AND ITS Z-TRANSFORM GIVES US A PARA-HERMITIAN POLYNOMIAL MATRIX.
utt_0040 utt 170.99 176.09 -X IN THIS TALK, WE WILL USE CALLIGRAPHIC FONT TO DENOTE A POLYNOMIAL MATRIX
utt_0042 utt 176.15 178.52 -X AND REGULAR FONT FOR MATRIX.
utt_0043 utt 181.33 183.89 -X THE PEVD IS DEFINED AS THE FOLLOWING,
utt_0044 utt 184.40 192.76 -X WHERE CAPITAL LAMBDA AND U REPRESENTS THE EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES, RESPECTIVELY.
utt_0046 utt 193.23 197.88 -X THE SUPERSCRIPT P DENOTES THE PARA-HERMITIAN OPERATOR THAT
utt_0047 utt 198.13 202.55 -X INVOLVES THE HERMITIAN TRANSPOSE OPERATION FOLLOWED BY A TIME-REVERSAL.
utt_0048 utt 204.37 206.97 -X THE EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRIX, U,
utt_0049 utt 207.09 210.42 -X CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A FILTERBANK WHICH
utt_0050 utt 210.55 216.02 -X PRODUCES OUTPUTS, Y, THAT ARE STRONGLY DECORRELATED.
utt_0051 utt 217.30 220.15 -X TO PERFORM THE POLYNOMIAL EVD,
utt_0052 utt 220.50 223.19 -X ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ALGORITHMS CAN BE USED.
utt_0053 utt 226.32 229.05 -X IN MULTICHANNEL SIGNAL PROCESSING,
utt_0054 utt 229.24 232.63 -X ONE TYPICALLY COMPUTES THE SPATIAL COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0055 utt 232.63 237.62 -X WHICH IS GIVEN BY THE OUTER PRODUCT OF THE INPUT SIGNALS.
utt_0056 utt 238.00 243.77 -X AND THIS CAN BE SEEN AS THE SPECIAL CASE OF THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX WHEN TAU=zero.
utt_0058 utt 244.47 252.09 -X HENCE, THIS IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE INSTANTANEOUS SPATIAL COVARIANCE MATRIX.
utt_0060 utt 252.31 257.72 -X BY COMPUTING THE CORRELATIONS AT ALL TIME LAGS AND TAKING THE Z-TRANSFORM,
utt_0062 utt 257.85 260.35 -X WE OBTAIN THE FOLLOWING POLYNOMIAL MATRIX.
utt_0063 utt 261.08 262.91 -X OBSERVE THAT FOR THIS EXAMPLE,
utt_0064 utt 263.41 266.91 -X ONLY THE PLANE AT ZERO-LAG IS DIAGONAL.
utt_0065 utt 271.06 276.06 -X THE GOAL OF THE PEVD ALGORITHM IS TO DIAGONALIZE AT ALL LAGS.
utt_0066 utt 277.08 284.83 -X NOTE THAT BECAUSE THE PLANES ARE COUPLED, WE CANNOT SIMPLY APPLY INDIVIDUAL EVDS AT DIFFERENT PLANES INDEPENDENTLY.
utt_0068 utt 287.77 296.99 -X THE POLYNOMIAL MATRIX CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A POLYNOMIAL WITH MATRIX COEFFICIENTS AS SHOWN ON THE LEFT
utt_0070 utt 297.33 308.19 -X OR EQUIVALENTLY, IT CAN BE INTERPRETED AS A MATRIX WITH POLYNOMIAL ELEMENTS. LET US TAKE A LOOK AT THE SAME EXAMPLE BEFORE AND AFTER DIAGONALIZATION.
utt_0073 utt 308.19 317.31 -X ON THE LEFT, THE Z-TRANSFORM OF THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX IS COMPUTED USING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SENSOR PAIRS.
utt_0075 utt 317.56 322.17 -X SO IN THIS CASE, WE WILL GET THE AUTO-CORRELATION TERMS ON THE DIAGONALS,
utt_0077 utt 322.90 326.56 -X SO THIS WILL BE THE AUTO-CORRELATION OF SENSOR one, two AND three.
utt_0078 utt 326.94 334.72 -X WHEREAS THE OFF-DIAGONALS ARE COMPUTED BASED ON THE CROSS-CORRELATION BETWEEN SENSOR one AND two,
utt_0080 utt 335.99 336.70 -X one AND three,
utt_0081 utt 336.92 338.30 -X two AND three IN THIS CASE.
utt_0082 utt 339.77 344.16 -X AND ON THE RIGHT, AFTER WE HAVE APPLIED THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM,
utt_0084 utt 344.16 351.84 -X WE WILL END UP WITH THIS DIAGONALIZED EIGENVALUE POLYNOMIAL MATRIX, LAMBDA OF Z.
utt_0086 utt 353.75 361.98 -X AND THE OFF-DIAGONALS ELEMENTS AT ALL LAGS ARE NOW ZEROED OFF.
utt_0088 utt 361.98 372.03 -X IN OUR EARLIER WORK, WE ONLY CONSIDER DIRECT-PATH PROPAGATION ONLY WHICH IS RELEVANT TO CLOSE TALKING SPEAKER TO THE MICROPHONE AND ANECHOIC ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0091 utt 372.63 375.89 -X IN DISTANT TALKING SCENARIOS AND ENCLOSED ROOMS
utt_0092 utt 375.93 379.42 -X SUCH AS VOICED CONTROLLED HOME SYSTEMS,
utt_0093 utt 379.83 383.23 -X MULTIPATH REVERBERATION MUST BE CONSIDERED.
utt_0094 utt 385.18 394.40 -X THE REVERBERANT CHANNEL CAN BE DECOMPOSED INTO THE DIRECT-PATH, EARLY AND LATE REFLECTIONS AS SHOWN IN RED AND BLUE,
utt_0096 utt 394.87 397.15 -X USING A TYPICAL EXAMPLE OF A ROOM.
utt_0097 utt 398.20 409.77 -X THE EARLY REFLECTIONS ARE CLOSELY SPACED ECHOES WHICH HAVE A DIRECT-PATH STRENGTHENING EFFECT AND MAY IMPROVE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
utt_0100 utt 410.07 412.86 -X WHEREAS THE LATE REFLECTIONS COMPRISE
utt_0101 utt 413.31 416.77 -X RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED SMALL AMPLITUDE COMPONENTS
utt_0102 utt 416.89 420.86 -X WHICH MAKES THE BLUE TERM UNCORRELATED WITH THE RED TERMS.
utt_0103 utt 421.28 427.78 -X HENCE, THIS TERM HERE CAN BE TREATED AS AN ADDITIVE NOISE COMPONENT.
utt_0104 utt 428.12 432.86 -X WE CAN THEN REWRITE THE SIGNAL MODEL BY INCORPORATING THE REVERBERANT CHANNEL
utt_0106 utt 433.28 438.85 -X TO GIVE S TILDE AND V TILDE, WHICH ARE UNCORRELATED.
utt_0107 utt 439.77 447.30 -X THEN, THE GOAL HERE IS TO OBTAIN SOME ENHANCED VERSION OF SPEECH USING MICROPHONE OBSERVATIONS, X.
utt_0109 utt 448.16 452.03 -X AND THE ENHANCEMENT TARGET CAN BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING.
utt_0110 utt 452.03 457.44 -X TO REDUCE NOISE OR TO IMPROVE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY AND QUALITY.
utt_0112 utt 459.64 462.82 -X SINCE S TILDE AND V TILDE ARE UNCORRELATED,
utt_0113 utt 462.82 472.23 -X THE POLYNOMIAL EVD DECOMPOSES THE SIGNALS INTO THE SIGNAL AND NOISE SUBSPACES, WHICH ARE ORTHOGONAL.
utt_0115 utt 472.64 474.95 -X FOR A SINGLE SPEAKER SCENARIO,
utt_0116 utt 475.39 481.70 -X THE DENOISED AND ENHANCED SIGNAL CAN BE RECOVERED BY A WEIGHTED RECONSTRUCTION IN THE SUBSPACE.
utt_0118 utt 483.74 487.14 -X THE SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM IS SUMMARIZED HERE.
utt_0119 utt 488.09 489.95 -X USING THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS,
utt_0120 utt 490.59 493.86 -X WE FIRST COMPUTE THE SPACE-TIME COVARIANCE MATRIX
utt_0121 utt 494.75 507.23 -X SO THE ON-DIAGONAL TERMS ARE THE AUTO-CORRELATION FUNCTIONS AND THE OFF-DIAGONALS ARE THE CROSS-CORRELATION FUNCTIONS SO THIS WILL BE BETWEEN MICROPHONE one AND two, one AND three, two AND three.
utt_0124 utt 510.37 513.73 -X FOLLOWED BY THE Z-TRANSFORM WHICH GIVES US A POLYNOMIAL MATRIX.
utt_0125 utt 515.29 520.63 -X THIS IS THEN USED AS THE INPUT INTO THE POLYNOMIAL EVD ALGORITHM
utt_0126 utt 520.67 526.72 -X WHICH PRODUCES THE EIGENVALUE AND EIGENVECTOR POLYNOMIAL MATRICES.
utt_0127 utt 528.16 537.22 -X THE MICROPHONE SIGNALS ARE THEN PASSED THROUGH THE EIGENVECTOR FILTERBANK AND THEN WE CAN RECOVER THE ENHANCED SIGNAL IN THE FIRST CHANNEL.
utt_0130 utt 537.34 540.55 -X BY REWEIGHING THE SUBSPACE COMPONENTS.
utt_0131 utt 543.68 547.35 -X WE NOW DEMONSTRATE AN EXAMPLE OF REVERBERANT SPEECH SIGNAL
utt_0132 utt 547.36 551.91 -X ARRIVING AT three MICROPHONES AND CORRUPTED BY zero DB BABBLE NOISE.
utt_0134 utt 552.64 562.76 -X THE SPEECH SIGNAL IS PRODUCED FROM THE TIMIT CORPUS WHILE THE LECTURE ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSE AND THE NOISE SIGNALS ARE OBTAINED FROM THE ACE CORPUS.
utt_0137 utt 564.19 568.42 -X IN THIS CASE, THE Tsixty OF THE ROOM IS one point two two SECONDS.
utt_0138 utt 571.04 577.00 -X WE THEN COMPARE OUR PROPOSED POLYNOMIAL EVD APPROACH AGAINST THE TWO SUBSPACE APPROACHES.
utt_0140 utt 577.02 582.82 -X SO, ONE IS BASED ON THE COLOURED NOISE AND THE OTHER IS THE MULTICHANNEL SUBSPACE METHOD
utt_0142 utt 584.07 586.55 -X AS WELL AS AGAINST THE LOG-MMSE AND
utt_0143 utt 587.55 590.79 -X TWO VERSIONS OF THE MULTICHANNEL WIENER FILTER.
utt_0144 utt 591.11 596.84 -X THE FIRST VERSION USES A RELATIVE TRANSFER FUNCTION (RTF) AND NOISE ESTIMATOR.
utt_0146 utt 598.15 600.87 -X THIS IS WHAT IS USED IN PRACTICE.
utt_0147 utt 601.92 605.96 -X THE SECOND VERSION IS WHAT WE CALL THE ORACLE-MWF
utt_0148 utt 606.27 613.45 -X WHICH HAS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEAN SPEECH SIGNAL AND ESTABLISHES THE UPPER BOUND PERFORMANCE.
utt_0150 utt 614.34 617.77 -X WE THEN EVALUATE THE ALGORITHMS USING THE FOLLOWING METRICS.
utt_0151 utt 619.14 624.45 -X THIS RESULTS OF THE ALGORITHMS FOR A SINGLE EXAMPLE IS SUMMARIZED HERE.
utt_0153 utt 624.45 634.47 -X FOR THIS EXAMPLE, POLYNOMIAL EVD WAS ABLE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE NOISE AND IMPROVE THE SPEECH QUALITY AND INTELLIGIBILITY SIGNIFICANTLY.
utt_0156 utt 636.58 641.16 -X COLSUB AND LOG-MMSE OFFERS SIGNIFICANT NOISE REDUCTION,
utt_0157 utt 641.51 651.02 -X HOWEVER, THIS WAS ACHIEVED AT THE EXPENSE OF INTRODUCING SPEECH DISTORTION AS INDICATED BY THE NEGATIVE STOI AND PESQ SCORES.
utt_0160 utt 653.28 656.39 -X MWF OFFERS SOME NOISE REDUCTION BUT
utt_0161 utt 657.64 662.12 -X NOT MUCH IMPROVEMENT IN SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY AND QUALITY.
utt_0162 utt 664.71 676.71 -X THE ORACLE MWF PERFORMED THE BEST IN STOI AND PESQ BECAUSE IT USES PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE CLEAN SPEECH SIGNAL AND IS DESIGNED TO MINIMISE SPEECH DISTORTION.
utt_0165 utt 676.71 688.65 -X HERE, POLYNOMIAL EVD PERFORMS COMPETITIVELY WHILE BEARING IN MIND THAT THE PEVD APPROACH IS A BLIND ALGORITHM AND IS STILL ABLE TO
utt_0168 utt 688.65 693.48 -X ACHIEVE SUBSTANTIAL NOISE REDUCTION.
utt_0169 utt 693.48 696.46 -X LET US LISTEN TO SOME AUDIO FILES.
utt_0170 utt 696.81 708.91 -X OF COURSE, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE DIFFERENCES ON THIS VIDEO RECORDING. SO I WILL BE PROVIDING THE LINK TO THE LISTENING EXAMPLES AT THE END OF THE TALK.
utt_0173 utt 708.91 711.18 -X HERE IS THE NOISY SIGNAL.
utt_0174 utt 719.37 720.84 -X (NOISY SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0175 utt 722.85 725.10 -X THE COLOURED NOISE (COLSUB).
utt_0176 utt 725.99 728.11 -X (COLSUB ENHANCED SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0177 utt 735.65 737.64 -X LOG-MMSE.
utt_0178 utt 741.06 743.27 -X (LOG-MMSE ENHANCED SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0179 utt 746.12 751.15 -X LET US HEAR AGAIN THE NOISY SIGNAL AGAIN BEFORE LISTENING TO THE REST.
utt_0181 utt 752.71 754.48 -X (NOISY SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0182 utt 755.05 757.04 -X THE ORACLE-MWF.
utt_0183 utt 779.05 781.61 -X (OMWF ENHANCED SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0184 utt 782.47 786.86 -X NOW, I WILL PLAY THE NOISY FOLLOWED BY POLYNOMIAL EVD.
utt_0185 utt 795.02 796.49 -X (NOISY SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0186 utt 799.21 800.65 -X POLYNOMIAL EVD.
utt_0187 utt 808.36 810.22 -X (PEVD ENHANCED SIGNAL PLAYING)
utt_0188 utt 816.07 819.21 -X IN THIS TALK, I HAVE INTRODUCED POLYNOMIAL MATRICES
utt_0189 utt 819.47 823.15 -X AND POLYNOMIAL EVD AS A TOOL FOR PROCESSING THEM.
utt_0190 utt 823.85 828.96 -X I THEN OUTLINED A PEVD-BASED SPEECH ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHM
utt_0191 utt 829.00 831.47 -X DESIGNED FOR REVERBERANT ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0192 utt 832.11 835.71 -X THE PROPOSED METHOD EXPLOITS THE LACK OF CORRELATION
utt_0193 utt 835.95 840.38 -X BETWEEN THE SPEECH AND LATE REFLECTIONS FOR FURTHER NOISE REDUCTION
utt_0194 utt 840.49 847.98 -X AND IT INCORPORATES THE EARLY REFLECTIONS TO FURTHER IMPROVE SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY AND QUALITY.
utt_0196 utt 847.98 857.74 -X THE PROPOSED APPROACH DOES NOT INTRODUCE ANY NOTICEABLE ARTIFACTS AND IT DOES NOT USE ANY NOISE ESTIMATOR.
utt_0198 utt 860.24 862.83 -X THESE ARE THE REFERENCES USED IN THIS TALK.
