utt_0000 utt 0.27 6.48 -X HI, I'M SUMITH KULAL, AND I'M GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR PAPER TITLED PROGRAMMATIC CONCEPT LEARNING FOR HUMAN.
utt_0003 utt 6.48 7.92 -X MOTION DESCRIPTION AND SYNTHESIS.
utt_0004 utt 8.11 13.71 -X THIS IS JOINT WORK WITH JIAYUAN MAO, ALEX AIKEN, AND JIAJUN WU.
utt_0005 utt 13.71 18.61 -X RECENT PROGRESS IN COMPUTER VISION AND DEEP LEARNING HAS PUSHED THE BOUNDARIES FOR SEVERAL VIDEO ANALYSIS TASKS.
utt_0007 utt 18.61 28.11 -X THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR ADVANCES IN HUMAN VIDEO DESCRIPTION, SUCH AS RECOGNIZING AND LOCALIZING ACTIONS AND HUMAN MOTION AND VIDEO SYNTHESIS SUCH AS CONTROL GENERATION FROM DESCRIPTIONS.
utt_0011 utt 29.33 35.35 -X HOWEVER, CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT PERFORM VIDEO DESCRIPTION AND SYNTHESIS FOCUS SOLELY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE TASKS.
utt_0013 utt 35.69 40.75 -X MOREOVER, LEARNING THESE RECOGNITION AND SYNTHESIS MODELS REQUIRES LOTS OF PAIRED DATA.
utt_0015 utt 41.20 47.60 -X WE POSIT THAT THESE ARE BETTER LEARNED JOINTLY AND PRESENT A FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES THIS LEARNING IN A DATA EFFICIENT MANNER.
utt_0018 utt 48.82 55.70 -X IN THIS WORK, WE PRESENT PROGRAMMATIC POTION CONCEPTS, A NOVEL HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATION FOR HUMAN MOTION.
utt_0020 utt 55.70 60.53 -X PMC PRESENTS A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN MOTION DESCRIPTION, SYNTHESIS, AND EDITING.
utt_0022 utt 60.69 67.38 -X WE CAN LEARN THE PMC REPRESENTATION IN A DATA-EFFICIENT MANNER BY LEVERAGING THE INDUCTIVE BIASES PRESENT IN HUMAN MOTION DATA.
utt_0025 utt 68.75 74.07 -X WE PRESENT A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR REPRESENTATION AND LEARNING FRAMEWORK.
utt_0027 utt 74.07 77.43 -X BEGINNING WITH LOW LEVEL INPUTS SUCH AS A SEQUENCE OF FRAMES OR KEYPOINTS,
utt_0028 utt 77.52 82.45 -X PMC LEARNS A DISTRIBUTION OF HIGH LEVEL MOTION CONCEPTS SUCH AS JUMPING JACKS.
utt_0030 utt 82.45 87.06 -X BUILDING ON PRIOR WORK, WE FIRST REPRESENT INPUT MOTION AS A SEQUENCE OF MOTION PRIMITIVES.
utt_0032 utt 87.15 96.53 -X WE FURTHER REPRESENT MOTION CONCEPTS AS A GROUPING OF CONSECUTIVE MOTION PRIMITIVES THAT HAVE A SEMANTIC NAME SUCH AS JUMPING JACKS OR SQUATS.
utt_0035 utt 96.53 99.61 -X WE START BY DESCRIBING OUR MOTION PRIMITIVE SYNTHESIS PIPELINE.
utt_0036 utt 101.27 105.59 -X WE BUILD UPON PRIOR WORK IN PRIMITIVE BASE MOTION REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0037 utt 105.59 111.70 -X THE KEY IDEA IS REPRESENTING MOTION TRAJECTORIES AS A SEQUENCE OF CURVES, EACH OF WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED WITH ONLY A FEW PARAMETERS.
utt_0039 utt 112.53 118.07 -X MOTION PROGRAMS CONSIDER THREE KINDS OF PRIMITIVES: STATIONARY, LINEAR, AND CIRCULAR.
utt_0041 utt 118.42 120.63 -X SHOWN HERE ARE TWO SUCH EXAMPLES.
utt_0042 utt 120.85 126.10 -X IN THIS WORK, WE EXPAND THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF PRIMITIVES BY ALSO INTRODUCING SPLINE-BASED PRIMITIVES.
utt_0044 utt 128.02 130.62 -X AFTER OBTAINING THE SEQUENCE OF MOTION PRIMITIVES.
utt_0045 utt 130.62 133.50 -X WE LEARN TO GROUP THESE PRIMITIVES INTO MOTION CONCEPTS.
utt_0049 utt 141.98 145.91 -X SIMPLE NEURAL ARCHITECTURE TO COMPUTE THE CONCEPT LABEL PREDICTIONS.
utt_0050 utt 145.91 150.94 -X WE THEN TRAIN IT USING A CTC OBJECTIVE THAT LEARNS TO ALIGN THE CONCEPT PREDICTIONS WITH THE VIDEO-LEVEL LABELS.
utt_0053 utt 153.69 161.08 -X ONCE WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TRAINED THE DESCRIPTION MODEL, WE CAN INSERT THE PMC REPRESENTATIONS FROM INPUT VIDEOS.
utt_0055 utt 161.08 167.00 -X WE THEN LEARN THE REVERSE PROCESS OF GOING FROM CONCEPT LABELS TO KEYPOINT SEQUENCES.
utt_0065 utt 189.34 191.45 -X WE PRESENT A FEW APPLICATIONS OF PMC.
utt_0068 utt 196.77 200.03 -X CONTROLLED MOTION SYNTHESIS, AND INTERACTIVE VIDEO MANIPULATION.
utt_0070 utt 203.74 205.41 -X THE TASK IS TO ACCURATELY RECOGNIZE AND
utt_0072 utt 209.02 212.61 -X A VISUALIZATION OF THE LOCALIZED INTERVALS FOR A SAMPLE IS SHOWN HERE.
utt_0074 utt 212.76 215.84 -X DIFFERENT COLORS DENOTE DIFFERENT INTERVALS LOCATED BY THE MODELS.
utt_0075 utt 216.16 220.03 -X THE LOCALIZED INTERVALS FROM OUR MODEL CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH THE GROUND TRUTH.
utt_0077 utt 222.17 224.67 -X NEXT, WE EVALUATE CONTROLLED MOTION SYNTHESIS.
utt_0078 utt 224.96 229.22 -X WE GENERATE REALISTIC MOTION AND VIDEO SEQUENCES BY PROMPTING A DESCRIPTION.
utt_0080 utt 229.85 232.45 -X HERE ARE SOME QUALITATIVE RESULTS.
utt_0081 utt 232.45 235.07 -X THE INPUT PROMPT IS sixty-three REPETITIONS OF JUMPING JACKS.
utt_0082 utt 235.52 240.06 -X WE OBSERVE THAT BOTH THE BASELINE MODELS PRODUCE UNNATURAL MOTION.
utt_0083 utt 240.06 245.92 -X ON THE RIGHT IS OUR SYNTHESIZED VIDEO FOR THE PROMPTED DESCRIPTION, WHICH LOOKS MORE REALISTIC AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INPUT DESCRIPTION.
utt_0087 utt 252.03 256.45 -X ON THE LEFT, WE HAVE AN INPUT VIDEO ON THE CORRESPONDING DETECTED POSES.
utt_0089 utt 256.45 264.29 -X USING PMC, WE CAN IDENTIFY THAT THERE ARE TWO CONCEPTS, THAT IS, TWO REPETITIONS OF JUMPING JACKS, EACH WITH TWO PRIMITIVES THAT IS MOVING HANDS UP AND BRINGING THEM DOWN.
utt_0092 utt 264.64 267.84 -X THE SHOWN EDITS HAVE BEEN APPLIED, RESULTING IN THE FOLLOWING OUTPUT.
utt_0094 utt 268.48 280.16 -X HERE WE PERFORM BOTH LOW-LEVEL EDITS SUCH AS SLOWING DOWN THE DESCENT OF EVERY REPETITION, AND HIGH-LEVEL EDITS, SUCH AS ADDING AN EXTRA REPETITION OF JUMPING JACKS, AND TWO REPETITIONS OF A DIFFERENT CONCEPT, HIGH KNEES.
utt_0099 utt 295.97 299.33 -X IN CONCLUSION, WE INTRODUCE PROGRAMMATIC MOTION CONCEPTS
utt_0100 utt 299.49 302.98 -X A NOVEL HIERARCHICAL REPRESENTATION FOR HUMAN MOTION.
utt_0101 utt 302.98 307.91 -X PMC PRESENTS A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR HUMAN MOTION DESCRIPTION, SYNTHESIS AND EDITING.
utt_0103 utt 307.91 311.43 -X WE SHOW THAT OUR CONCEPT REPRESENTATION CAN BE LEARNED IN A DATA-EFFICIENT MANNER.
utt_0105 utt 311.43 314.12 -X AND IS EFFECTIVE ON MULTIPLE DOWNSTREAM APPLICATIONS.
utt_0106 utt 314.12 314.79 -2.2465 THANK YOU.
