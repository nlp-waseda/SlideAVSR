utt_0000 utt 0.16 10.10 -X TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE PRESENTING ON DESIGNING TRANS TECHNOLOGY: DEFINING CHALLENGES AND ENVISIONING COMMUNITY-CENTERED SOLUTIONS. I'M GOING TO
utt_0002 utt 10.10 16.08 -X INTRODUCE ZU WEINGER WHO'S GOING TO BE PRESENTING THE FIRST PART HERE.
utt_0003 utt 17.48 22.91 -X HELLO, I'M ZU. I'M A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND I WORKED WITH OLIVER ON
utt_0004 utt 25.93 39.44 -X THIS PROJECT. WE DID THIS RESEARCH BECAUSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR TRANS PEOPLE AND WE WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE USE THE WORD TRANS WE MEAN PEOPLE WHOSE CURRENT GENDERS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE THAT
utt_0007 utt 39.44 52.21 -X WERE ASSIGNED TO THEM AT BIRTH AND EXPLICITLY INCLUDES NON-BINARY PEOPLE WHICH WE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. BEING TRANS AND USING TECHNOLOGY BRINGS UP A LOT OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES SINCE TECHNOLOGIES ARE GENERALLY NOT
utt_0010 utt 52.21 64.47 -X CREATED WITH THE INTENTION OF INCLUDING TRANS PEOPLE AND SUPPORTING THEIR EXPERIENCES. TRANS PEOPLE FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND WHEN USING TECHNOLOGY DUE TO THE GENDER TRANSITION PROCESS WHICH MAY INVOLVE
utt_0013 utt 64.47 70.03 -X SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND/OR LEGAL CHANGES LIKE NAME CHANGES AND ALSO TRANSPHOBIA,
utt_0014 utt 70.03 73.94 -X DISCRIMINATION, VIOLENCE, ALGORITHMIC BIAS, AND LACK OF RESOURCES.
utt_0015 utt 74.29 88.63 -X SO A QUESTION THAT WE HAD WAS HOW CAN SOCIAL TECHNOLOGIES BE DESIGNED WITH AND FOR TRANS COMMUNITIES. OUR TWO MAIN RESEARCH QUESTIONS - WE SOUGHT TO
utt_0017 utt 88.63 101.46 -X UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES TRANS INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES FACED AND HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN BE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THESE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES, AND WE DID THIS BY ADDRESSING THESE RESEARCH QUESTIONS. HOW CAN TECHNOLOGY BEST SUPPORT TRANS
utt_0020 utt 101.46 116.15 -X INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AND MEET THEIR NEEDS? AND WHAT TYPES OF FUTURE TRANS TECHNOLOGIES DO TRANS PEOPLE ENVISION? FUTURE MAKING THROUGH DESIGN INVOLVES BRAINSTORMING A LIST OF CRITIQUES TO THE CURRENT SITUATION, AND
utt_0023 utt 116.15 130.10 -X IN THIS CASE THE CHALLENGES THAT TRANS PEOPLE FACE IN SOCIETY AND IN MANY AREAS OF LIFE INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, AND THEN TRANSFORMING THOSE CRITIQUES TO POSITIVE OUTCOMES. SO WE CONDUCTED PARTICIPATORY DESIGN SESSIONS FOCUSING ON FUTURE
utt_0026 utt 130.10 143.86 -X MAKING THROUGH DESIGN WITH THREE SESSIONS - TWO OF THEM HELD HERE IN ANN ARBOR AND ONE IN PHILADELPHIA DURING THE TRANS WELLNESS CONFERENCE - WHICH WERE TWO HOURS EACH, AND WE COMPENSATED PARTICIPANTS WITH A $forty GIFT CARD AND
utt_0029 utt 143.86 149.01 -X MEAL OR SNACKS. AND WE HAVE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR PARTICIPANTS BELOW -
utt_0030 utt 149.33 159.43 -X twenty-one PEOPLE TOTAL. SO WE ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS IF WE COULD TAKE PHOTOS DURING ON OUR PARTICIPATORY DESIGN SESSIONS AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE
utt_0032 utt 159.43 167.94 -X WHEN WE WERE HAVING PARTICIPANTS DRAW OUT THEIR TECHNOLOGIES. SO OUR FIRST ACTIVITY INCLUDED WRITING ON POST-IT NOTES
utt_0034 utt 167.94 174.53 -X WHAT CHALLENGES IS OUR COMMUNITY FACING AND THIS PROMPT WAS MEANT TO CREATE
utt_0035 utt 175.99 189.88 -X DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH THROUGH SO AFTER WE ASKED THIS QUESTION WE CATEGORIZED THEM AND DID COLLABORATIVE AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
utt_0037 utt 189.88 204.79 -X THAT WAS LED BY THE PARTICIPANTS. AND HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. SO WE HAVE HEALTHCARE AS ONE WHERE PEOPLE SAY COMPETENT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND NO THERAPY, AND THEN THE OTHER ONE LISTED IS WORK AND MONEY WHERE
utt_0040 utt 204.79 210.31 -X PEOPLE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT, NO MONEY NO JOBS. SO WE HAVE A TOTAL OF thirteen
utt_0041 utt 210.71 221.16 -X CATEGORIES THAT WE FOUND WHEN WE WERE DOING THE AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING AND SO THE MAIN THE FIRST ONE WAS ACCESS TO SOCIETY, WHICH INCLUDE RESTROOM ACCESS
utt_0043 utt 221.16 234.02 -X AND BEING SAFE IN PHYSICAL SPACES. FINANCIAL AND EMPLOYMENT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND BINARY JOB APPLICATIONS. GATEKEEPING, SUCH AS NOT
utt_0045 utt 234.02 240.02 -X FEELING TRANS ENOUGH OR TRANSPHOBIA WITHIN LGB SPACES. HEALTHCARE, SUCH AS
utt_0046 utt 240.34 252.55 -X LACK OF TRANS COMPETENT PROVIDERS. NEXT ONE WAS HOUSING WHICH INCLUDED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. LACK OF ACCESS TO RESOURCES, WHICH
utt_0048 utt 252.55 262.26 -X ARE ALSO LISTED BEFORE LIKE HEALTH CARE, HOUSING, FOODS. LACK OF RESPECT FOR ONE'S IDENTITY WHICH INCLUDES PEOPLE USING INCORRECT NAMES OR PRONOUNS.
utt_0050 utt 263.03 271.42 -X ONLINE IDENTITY WAS OUR NEXT ONE, INCLUDING A DIFFICULTY OF EXPRESSING TRANS IDENTITY ONLINE AND PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY.
utt_0052 utt 271.76 283.19 -X POLICE WAS OUR NEXT CATEGORY, INCLUDING HARASSMENT BY POLICE AND POLICE VIOLENCE. PRESSURE TO EDUCATE CISGENDER PEOPLE ABOUT TRANS IDENTITIES, SUCH AS LACK OF EXISTING EDUCATIONAL
utt_0054 utt 283.19 294.87 -X RESOURCES. OUR NEXT ONE WAS RACIAL INJUSTICE, INCLUDING WHITE SUPREMACY AND ANTI-BLACKNESS. VIOLENCE, INCLUDING MURDER OF TRANS WOMEN OF COLOR AND HARASSMENT.
utt_0056 utt 295.03 304.31 -X AND OUR FINAL CATEGORY WAS MISCELLANEOUS CHALLENGES WHICH DIDN'T FIT INTO ANY OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, SUCH AS LACK OF ACCESS TO TRANS HISTORY AND TRANS
utt_0058 utt 304.31 314.38 -X EXPERIENCES BEING MARGINAL TO CISGENDER EXPERIENCES. SO AFTER WE DID THIS ACTIVITY WITH CHALLENGES WE LED PARTICIPANTS THROUGH A WORD ASSOCIATIONS
utt_0060 utt 314.38 325.27 -X THROUGH BRAIN-WRITING ACTIVITY WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS THESE TWO BIG QUESTIONS: WHAT IDEAS COME TO MIND WHEN WE SAY TRANS TECHNOLOGY, AND HOW MIGHT
utt_0062 utt 325.27 336.19 -X TECHNOLOGY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DISCUSSED. DURING THIS ACTIVITY PEOPLE WOULD WRITE DOWN AN IDEA THAT THEY HAD ABOUT THESE TWO QUESTIONS,
utt_0064 utt 336.19 343.99 -X AND THEN THEY WOULD PASS THE NOTE CARD TO THE PERSON ON THEIR RIGHT AND THE PERSON ON THE RIGHT WOULD EXPAND OR BUILD ON THE IDEA THAT WAS FIRST WRITTEN.
utt_0066 utt 344.02 357.66 -X AND PEOPLE WOULD COLLABORATE A REALLY BRAINSTORM SKETCH AND PRESENT THE WORK TO THE GROUP ONCE WE HAD ABOUT FIVE IDEAS ON EACH CARD. SO WE CAME UP WITH FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF TRANS TECHNOLOGIES. THE FIRST WAS TECHNOLOGIES
utt_0069 utt 357.66 368.63 -X FOR CHANGING BODIES, THE NEXT WAS TECHNOLOGIES FOR CHANGING APPEARANCES AND GENDER EXPRESSIONS. AND THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THE FIRST CATEGORY IS MORE ABOUT PHYSICAL CHANGES, AND THE NEXT CATEGORY IS MORE ABOUT PEOPLE'S
utt_0072 utt 368.63 376.92 -X APPEARANCES AND HOW THEY EXPRESS GENDER. THE THIRD CATEGORY WAS TECHNOLOGIES FOR SAFETY AND THEN FINALLY TECHNOLOGIES FOR FINDING RESOURCES.
utt_0074 utt 378.71 392.80 -X SO IN OUR FIRST CATEGORY PARTICIPANTS IN THE DESIGN SESSIONS EXPRESSED THE NEED TO HAVE AUTONOMY OVER THEIR GENDER EXPRESSION REGARDING THEIR PHYSICAL BODY AND THEIR IDENTITY, AND SO THEY ENVISIONED TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS THIS. SO
utt_0077 utt 392.80 405.95 -X ONE EXAMPLE WAS A BODY CHANGING LABORATORY AND PARTICIPANTS SAID THAT THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN STEP INTO A MACHINE AND IT WILL LIKE YOU CHANGE AND RESHAPE YOUR BODY. THIS MACHINE ALLOWS US TO APPLY FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS
utt_0080 utt 405.95 420.67 -X WHATEVER IS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPLY OR ENHANCE ON YOURSELF. SO THOUGH GENDER CONFIRMATION SURGERY HAPPENS FREQUENTLY IN TRANS COMMUNITIES, WHAT MAKES THIS DESIGN DIFFERENT IS THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND DO-IT-YOURSELF NATURE OF A BODY
utt_0083 utt 420.67 434.27 -X CHANGING LABORATORY. SO WHILE THIS DESIGN IDEA IS CLEARLY VERY SPECULATIVE AND MAY NOT BE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE, IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT INSIGHT INTO THE NEED TO GIVE TRANS PEOPLE MORE CONTROL AND AGENCY OVER TRANSITION-RELATED HEALTH
utt_0086 utt 434.27 444.80 -X CARE NEEDS. THE NEXT CATEGORY IS TECHNOLOGIES FOR CHANGING APPEARANCES AND GENDER EXPRESSIONS. SO SOME PARTICIPANTS WERE CONSIDERING MORE
utt_0088 utt 444.80 459.66 -X PHYSICAL RATHER THAN DIGITAL APPROACHES TO WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY DESIGN. MANY PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED EXPERIENCES THEY HAD WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO BUY CLOTHING THAT WAS PARTICULARLY CATERED FOR TRANS PEOPLE, AND DESCRIBED WAYS TO DESIGN
utt_0091 utt 459.66 469.12 -X CLOTHING TO ADDRESS TRANS-SPECIFIC CHALLENGES. SO ONE PARTICIPANT SAID THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THE APPEARANCE BASED ON WHAT YOU PREFER AT THE MOMENT.
utt_0093 utt 469.12 483.29 -X SO IT CAN HAVE A PADDING ILLUSION, OR BINDING, YOU CAN CHANGE THE PATTERN OF THE CLOTHING AS WELL AS THE SHAPE LIKE WHETHER YOU WANT A DRESS OR TANK TOP OR SHORTS. AND THE PARTICIPANT SAID MAYBE A PRACTICAL THING COULD BE JUST CLOTHES
utt_0096 utt 483.29 495.81 -X THEY CAN BE FOLDED OR MANIPULATED IN SUCH A WAY SO THAT THEY COULD BE A DIFFERENT SHAPE. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THAT HIGH TECH... IF THERE'S REVERSIBLE COATS, I'M SURE THAT IDEA COULD BE TAKEN IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.
utt_0099 utt 497.53 509.92 -X ANOTHER IDEA INVOLVED A NECKLACE WITH INTERCHANGEABLE PRONOUN LABELS THAT WOULD FLASH IN CERTAIN COLORS WHEN A PERSON WAS MISGENDERED. AND IT ALSO INCLUDES A SMOKESCREEN CANISTER THAT ENABLES THE WEAR TO
utt_0102 utt 509.92 522.10 -X DISAPPEAR IF NECESSARY. PARTICIPANTS ALSO ENVISIONED MIRRORS AND GLASSES THAT COULD CHANGE A PERSON'S VIEW OF THEMSELVES OR THEIR EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD. THIS WAS
utt_0104 utt 522.10 534.21 -X SORT OF AN EXTENSION ON THE BODY CHANGING DESIGN IDEAS. PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED THINGS LIKE AUGMENTED GLASSES AND MIRROR TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW A PERSON TO VIEW THEMSELVES AS THEY ENVISION THEIR GENDER, AND TO SEE HOW
utt_0107 utt 534.21 546.62 -X POTENTIAL BODY CHANGES WOULD LOOK BEFORE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH THE PROCEDURES. SO ONE PARTICIPANT SAID YOU START BY SEEING IN A MIRROR SO YOU CAN CHANGE HOW YOU WANT TO SEE IT FIRST BEFORE YOU GO INTO THE MACHINE AND
utt_0110 utt 546.62 556.64 -X CHANGE IT. IN ADDITION TO CHANGES TO ONE'S OWN APPEARANCE, AUGMENTED TECHNOLOGY COULD ALSO CHANGE PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES WITH OTHERS. FOR INSTANCE,
utt_0112 utt 556.64 568.13 -X BEING ABLE TO VIEW ONE'S WORLD DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WORLD THAT THEY ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. ONE PARTICIPANT SAID, WHAT IF YOU HAD GLASSES WHERE YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF IN SOCIETY AS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOURSELF IN
utt_0115 utt 568.13 580.74 -X SOCIETY AND YOU COULDN'T SEE TRANSPHOBIA, YOU COULDN'T SEE TRANSMISOGYNY OR ANY OTHER ISM. OUR NEXT CATEGORY WAS TECHNOLOGIES FOR SAFETY, AND A PRIMARY
utt_0117 utt 580.74 584.16 -X CHALLENGE THAT PARTICIPANTS MENTIONED DURING THE DESIGN SESSIONS WAS THEIR
utt_0118 utt 584.35 595.65 -X CONCERN FOR SAFETY, AND THIS WAS PARTICULARLY ABOUT FEARS OF VIOLENCE IN PUBLIC SPACES. SO PARTICIPANTS ENVISIONED A COMMUNITY-BASED TECHNOLOGICAL
utt_0120 utt 595.65 609.83 -X APPLICATION THAT INVOLVED AS THEY SAID, SOME TYPE OF HOTLINE OR DEVICE THAT ENABLES GUARDIAN ANGELS TO BE ALERTED WHEN VIOLENCE OCCURS. IT WOULD CONFIRM AN APPROPRIATE OR EFFECTIVE JUSTICE IS DONE... THAT ACTUALLY HOLDS POLICE ACCOUNTABLE.
utt_0123 utt 612.16 626.63 -X OUR FINAL CATEGORY WAS TECHNOLOGIES FOR FINDING RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE OF FINDING RESOURCES, SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS DESIGNED WHAT THEY CALLED A TRANS YELP. SUCH A SITE OR APP WOULD OFFER
utt_0126 utt 626.63 632.32 -X AN ONLINE SPACE FOR TRANS PEOPLE TO RATE AND REVIEW LOCAL BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY,
utt_0127 utt 632.32 645.99 -X IT WOULD ENABLE TRANS PEOPLE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT TRANS-FRIENDLY RESTROOMS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, HEALTH CARE ASSISTANCE, AFFORDABLE FOOD, ETC. AND BECAUSE THIS IDEA WAS RAISED BY MULTIPLE GROUPS OF PARTICIPANTS, WE SAW A FEW
utt_0130 utt 645.99 650.08 -X DIFFERENT VARIATIONS. SO ONE GROUP SKETCHED A TRANS YELP THAT FOCUSED SOLELY
utt_0131 utt 650.40 661.25 -X ON HEALTHCARE RESOURCES AND FINDING TRANS-FRIENDLY AND TRANS-COMPETENT DOCTORS. ANOTHER GROUP DRAFTED A TRANS YELP THAT CENTERED BLACK TRANS PEOPLE THAT
utt_0133 utt 661.25 666.82 -X THEY CALLED BTF. AND THOSE PARTICIPANTS SAID, ARE THEY SPECIFICALLY QUEER SPACES?
utt_0134 utt 666.82 679.68 -X I ALSO ADDED A POTENTIAL FILTER, DOWN TO ARE THEY FRIENDLY TO QUEER AND TRANS PEOPLE OF COLOR, SPECIFICALLY? AND ON THERE, YOU CAN HAVE RESOURCES ABOUT WHY YOU NEED QUEER SPACES WHY YOU NEED SPACES SPECIFICALLY FOR QUEER PEOPLE OF
utt_0137 utt 681.95 691.81 -X COLOR. SO TO RECAP, OUR FOUR CATEGORIES OF TRANS TECHNOLOGIES ARE LISTED HERE, AND MANY OF THE DESIGNS THAT WE DESCRIBED ABOVE,
utt_0139 utt 691.81 706.15 -X WHETHER THERE WERE THINGS LIKE TRADITIONAL SITES OR APPS, OR WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY, PHYSICAL TECHNOLOGY, AUGMENTED REALITY, OR FUTURISTIC FORM ALTERING TECHNOLOGIES, MANY OF THEM INCLUDED COMMUNITY BASED ASPECTS IN SERIOUS WAYS.
utt_0142 utt 706.15 715.64 -X AND THIS SIGNIFIES THAT TRANS TECHNOLOGY DESIGN MUST REACH BEYOND DESIGN FOR INDIVIDUALS TO DESIGN FOR COMMUNITIES AND CONSIDER HOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN
utt_0144 utt 715.64 726.87 -X USE TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER. ADDITIONALLY THIS LINE OF WORK IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT DOMBROWSKI ET AL. CALL SOCIAL JUSTICE-ORIENTED INTERACTION
utt_0146 utt 726.87 737.99 -X DESIGN, IN WHICH HCI DESIGN IS NOT JUST ABOUT TECHNOLOGICAL POSSIBILITY, BUT ALSO ABOUT POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY. DESIGNING WITH TRANS PEOPLE TO ADDRESS TRANS
utt_0148 utt 737.99 751.49 -X CHALLENGES IS A SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE IN WHICH MARGINALIZED PEOPLE'S EXPERIENCES OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION ARE AT THE FOREFRONT. AND ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE MANY PARTICIPANTS IN OUR STUDY WERE BLACK OR WERE OF
utt_0151 utt 751.49 761.77 -X ADDITIONAL MARGINALIZED RACES OR ETHNICITIES, WE CAN'T SEPARATE RACIAL INEQUITIES FROM OUR FINDINGS. RACE FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN PARTICIPANTS' DESIGN IDEATIONS.
utt_0153 utt 761.77 770.66 -X SO WHEN WE DESCRIBED DESCRIBE TRANS TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW TO DESIGN THEM, WHAT THIS MEANS IS INTERSECTIONAL TRANS TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALSO CENTER
utt_0155 utt 770.66 782.73 -X MARGINALIZED RACES, ETHNICITIES, AND ADDITIONAL SALIENT IDENTITY FACETS. TO SUMMARIZE, ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY CAN'T SOLVE THE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES THAT
utt_0157 utt 782.73 792.89 -X TRANS PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES FACE, IT CAN IN SOME WAYS IMPROVE TRANS PEOPLE'S LIVES. TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP TO PROVIDE SPACE AND SUPPORT THAT ENABLE TRANS
utt_0159 utt 792.89 804.55 -X PEOPLE TO EXPRESS AND CHANGE BODIES, APPEARANCES, AND GENDER PRESENTATIONS TO MAINTAIN SAFETY SHARE RESOURCES AND CONNECT WITH OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SO
utt_0161 utt 804.55 808.52 -X THE NEXT STEPS FOR OUR PROJECT, WE'RE GOING TO BE PROTOTYPING SOME OF THESE
utt_0162 utt 808.55 822.76 -X TECHNOLOGY DESIGNS AND DOING SOME FOLLOW-UP DESIGN SESSIONS. AND IMPORTANTLY DESIGNING TRANS TECHNOLOGIES MUST INVOLVE MAINTAINING CONNECTIONS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS, DESIGNING WITH THEM, AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A VOICE
utt_0165 utt 822.76 833.35 -X IN THE DESIGN PROCESS. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE, AND THANKS THE ORGANIZERS AND ALSO THANKS TO THE MICHIGAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH ON WOMEN
utt_0167 utt 833.35 837.86 -4.4041 AND GENDER FOR FUNDING THIS WORK. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS.
