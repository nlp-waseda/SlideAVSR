utt_0000 utt 1.10 11.28 -X WELCOME EVERYONE. MY NAME IS HENDRIK SCHROETER AND TODAY I WILL PRESENT DEEPFILTERNET, A LOW COMPLEXITY SPEECH ENHANCEMENT FRAMEWORK BASED ON DEEP FILTERING.
utt_0002 utt 12.91 14.99 -X SO THESE ARE OUR CONTRIBUTIONS.
utt_0003 utt 15.08 30.03 -X WE PROPOSE TO USE A PERCEPTIONAL SPEECH ENHANCEMENT APPROACH THAT WORKS WITH FULL BAND AUDIO. WE HAVE REAL-TIME CAPABILITIES AND SUPPORT LATENCIES DOWN TO five MILLISECONDS. THE OVERALL COMPLEXITY IS REALLY LOW, WITH ONLY
utt_0006 utt 31.85 37.49 -X zero point three five GIGA MULTIPLY ADDS PER SECOND. THE CODE IS OPEN SOURCE AND
utt_0007 utt 38.41 44.66 -X WE ALSO HAVE A DEMO, WHICH I WILL SHOW YOU IN THE END OF THE PRESENTATION.
utt_0008 utt 48.40 53.55 -X SO WE ASSUME THE SPEECH MODEL THAT CONSISTS OF A PERIODIC AND A STOCHASTIC COMPONENT.
utt_0009 utt 54.99 65.17 -X SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO HAVE two STAGES IN OUR FRAMEWORK. THE FIRST ONE ENHANCES ONLY THE SPEECH ENVELOPE.
utt_0011 utt 65.17 72.92 -X AND THE SECOND STAGE THEN FOCUSES TO ENHANCE THE PERIODIC PART OF SPEECH. SO LET'S DEMONSTRATE THIS ON THIS EXAMPLE.
utt_0012 utt 72.92 77.11 -X HERE, WE HAVE A NOISY SAMPLE WITH SOME BACKGROUND NOISE.
utt_0013 utt 77.23 80.79 -X SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
utt_0014 utt 82.67 89.80 -X AND IF WE ER LOOK THE ENHANCED VERSION USING ONLY THE FIRST STAGE OF THE FRAMEWORK
utt_0015 utt 90.54 97.06 -X NOW LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
utt_0016 utt 97.39 102.23 -X SO YOU CAN HEAR THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE REMOVED.
utt_0017 utt 102.23 115.43 -X BUT YOU CAN STILL HEAR NOISE SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE VOICED PARTS OF SPEECH. SO YOU CAN STILL BARELY HEAR THE BACKGROUND NOISE. AND WHEN WE ZOOM IN WE CAN STILL SEE THESE HORIZONTAL [NOISE] STRIPES
utt_0019 utt 115.43 127.32 -X AND THE SPEECH HARMONICS ARE NOT VERY CLEAR. SO NOW LET US LISTEN TO THE FINALLY ENHANCED VERSION USING ALSO THE SECOND STAGE, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE PERIODIC COMPONENT OF SPEECH.
utt_0021 utt 129.17 135.83 -X SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION SO NOW THE SPEECH SOUNDS A LOT MORE CLEAR.
utt_0022 utt 141.49 143.16 -X NOW LET'S LOOK AT THE FRAMEWORK.
utt_0023 utt 143.57 149.56 -X STARTING WITH A NOISY AUDIO SIGNAL X: WE TRANSFORM IT TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN, USING A SHORT TIME FOURIER TRANSFORMATION.
utt_0024 utt 150.10 156.34 -X THEN FOR THE FIRST STAGE WE COMPUTE ERB FEATURES, WHERE WE BASICALLY SCALE DOWN OUR
utt_0025 utt 156.75 162.49 -X INPUT SPECTROGRAM TO ERB BANDS, RESULTING IN ONLY THIRTY TWO.
utt_0026 utt 162.83 171.32 -X ERB BAND FEATURES. THESE ARE FIT INTO THE ENCODER DECODER STRUCTURE WHERE WE HAVE SOME CONVOLUTIONS AND A GRU.
utt_0027 utt 172.40 176.95 -X AND THE OUTPUT GAINS ARE ALSO IN ERB SCALE, SO ALSO ONLY THIRTY TWO ERB
utt_0028 utt 177.81 184.25 -X SCALED GAINS ARE THEN APPLIED TO THE NOISY SPECTRUM BY SCALING THEM BACK TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN
utt_0029 utt 184.25 198.23 -X AND JUST POINT WAS MULTIPLYING. SO THESE GAINS ARE ONLY REAL VALUED. AND HERE, GIVEN THE COARSE FREQUENCY RESOLUTION, WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO ENHANCE THE SPEECH ENVELOPE. FOR THE SECOND STAGE, WE COMPUTE COMPLEX FEATURES.
utt_0031 utt 198.26 205.37 -X BECAUSE NOW, WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE PERIODIC COMPONENT OF SPEECH AND THEREFORE NEED TO MODIFY IN THE FACE TO REMOVE ALL THE NOISE AROUND
utt_0032 utt 206.39 211.00 -X THE SPEECH HARMONICS. AND THEN,
utt_0033 utt 211.00 222.20 -X THESE COMPLEX FEATURES ARE FIT INTO THE DEEPFILTERNET PART, WHICH THEN PREDICTS COMPLEX COEFFICIENT C. THESE ARE APPLIED ON THE ALREADY ENHANCED SPECTRUM.
utt_0035 utt 225.56 233.43 -X AND, FINALLY, IS TRANSFORMED BACK TO TIME DOMAIN USING AN INVERSE STFT. NOW, BEFORE LOOKING
utt_0037 utt 234.65 239.16 -X AT DEEP FILTERING, I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE NETWORK STRUCTURE.
utt_0038 utt 239.48 249.40 -X THE FIRST STAGE IS ESSENTIALLY A SIMPLE U-NET WHERE WE HAVE SOME CONVOLUTIONS, THAT A SCALED DOWN, THE FREQUENCY DIMENSION AS WELL AS SOME GRUS IN THE BOTTOM.
utt_0040 utt 251.70 264.83 -X WE OVERALL FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING A VERY EFFICIENT DNN THAT HAS STANDARD LAYERS THAT WE CAN ALSO FUSE TOGETHER AND HAS GOOD SUPPORT IN INFERENCE FRAMEWORKS. FINALLY TO GET
utt_0042 utt 264.83 270.59 -X THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS, AND ESPECIALLY MULTIPLE AD OPERATIONS, LOW, WE FOCUSSED ON GETTING SMALL.
utt_0043 utt 271.16 277.53 -X INPUT / OUTPUT. SO FOR THE FIRST STAGE WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY TWO ERB BANDS PER TIME STEP.
utt_0044 utt 277.53 283.68 -X FOR THE SECOND STAGE WE HAVE, I THINK, NINETY SIX FREQUENCY BINS, SO FREQUENCY BINS UP TO A FREQUENCY OF
utt_0045 utt 284.02 293.98 -X five KHZ. AND THIS ALLOWS TO ONLY HAVE A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF PARAMETERS AND ESPECIALLY MULTIPLY ADDS.
utt_0047 utt 295.29 304.49 -X AND FINALLY WE ALSO USE DNN SPARSENESS BY GROUPING, SO BASICALLY A LINEAR OR GRU LAYER, CONSISTS OF
utt_0048 utt 304.54 311.58 -X MULTIPLE SMALLER ONES, THAT ONLY PRESERVES PART OF THE INPUT AND THIS GREATLY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS AND
utt_0049 utt 311.71 317.89 -X FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS. ON THE TRAINING DETAILS: WE TRAINED ON THE DNS THREE DATA SET.
utt_0050 utt 318.27 324.93 -X WE USES THIRTY TWO ERB BANDS, AS STATED BEFORE FOR THE FIRST STAGE, AND FINALLY,
utt_0051 utt 324.93 337.50 -X FOR THE SECOND STAGE WE USE AN UPPER FREQUENCY OF five KHZ. SINCE SINCE THE ENERGY OR THE MOST ENERGY OF PERIODIC COMPONENT IS BELOW THAT. WE USE A LOSS IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN.
utt_0053 utt 337.69 352.19 -X WITH A MAGNITUDE PART AND A COMPLEX PART WHERE C IS A COMPRESSION PARAMETER TO MODEL THE PERCEIVED LOUDNESS, I THINK IT'S ZERO POINT SIX. AND FURTHERMORE, IF YOU EXPERIENCE ON THE GRADIENT
utt_0055 utt 353.21 359.01 -X COMPUTATION. WE ALSO PROPOSE A WAY TO MAKE THE GRADIENT MORE ROBUST.
utt_0056 utt 359.20 364.96 -X YOU MAY HAVE A LOOK AT THE PAPER THEN.
utt_0057 utt 364.96 371.58 -X NOW WHAT IS DEEP FILTERING? SO WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS WE USE A COMPLEX RATIO MASK WHERE WE HAVE
utt_0058 utt 371.90 377.22 -X ONE COMPLEX EFFICIENT PER TIME AND FREQUENCY BIN,
utt_0059 utt 377.22 388.35 -X THAT WE JUST MULTIPLY WITH THE NOISY SPECTRUM. WHAT WE USE INSTEAD IS DEEP FILTERING WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE COEFFICIENTS THAT ARE THEN MULTIPLIED
utt_0061 utt 388.35 393.50 -X TO THE CORRESPONDING TIME FREQUENCY BINS AND FINALLY SUM SUMMED UP.
utt_0062 utt 394.94 407.87 -X THE GET THE CURRENT ENHANCED TIME FREQUENCY BIN. SO ESSENTIALLY, THIS IS A OR A COMPLEX LINEAR COMBINATION OR A COMPLEX FILTER OF ORDER N. AND IN THIS CASE N IS four.
utt_0064 utt 412.09 413.87 -X SO ESSENTIALLY, A CRM
utt_0065 utt 414.88 420.32 -X IS JUST A SPECIAL CASE OF DEEP FILTERING, WHERE WE HAVE THE FILTER ORDER OF one.
utt_0066 utt 421.47 425.15 -X NOW, WHEN WE COMPARE THE FILTERING AND THE COMPLEX RATIO MASK
utt_0067 utt 425.89 432.74 -X WE CAN SEE IN THIS EXPERIMENT OVER MULTIPLE FFT SIZES, SO HERE two hundred and forty CORRESPONDS TO five MS
utt_0068 utt 435.20 437.67 -X AND one thousand, four hundred and forty CORRESPONDS TO thirty MS.
utt_0069 utt 439.61 445.15 -X WE CAN SEE IN THAT DEEP FILTERING OUTPERFORMS THE COMPLEX RATIO MASK OVER
utt_0070 utt 445.44 452.96 -X ALL FFT SIZES AND ALSO ALL FREQUENCY RESOLUTIONS. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE LOW FFT SIZES
utt_0071 utt 453.18 459.80 -X WHERE WE HAVE A LOW FREQUENCY RESOLUTION. SO FOR INSTANCE FOR TWO AND FORTY SAMPLES
utt_0072 utt 461.34 473.48 -X FFT WINDOW SIZE, WE HAVE A FREQUENCY RESOLUTION OF two hundred and fifty HZ. ASSUMING A LOW MALE A PITCH OF fifty HZ, WE COULD HAVE UP TO FIVE SPEECH HARMONICS
utt_0074 utt 473.48 484.84 -X WITHIN ONE FREQUENCY BIN. AND HERE, THE COMPLEX RATION MASK REALLY STRUGGLES TO RECONSTRUCT THE CLEAN PHASE, SINCE WE HAVE FIVE COMPLEX POINTERS THAT ROTATE
utt_0076 utt 487.01 494.92 -X WITH DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND DEEP FILTERING ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS NOW THE ADVANTAGE TO INCORPORATE
utt_0077 utt 495.84 500.23 -X OR TO MODEL THE PERIODIC, THE UNDERLYING PERIODIC SIGNAL.
utt_0078 utt 500.35 505.25 -X AND THUS IS ABLE TO BETTER RECONSTRUCT THE ORIGINAL CLEAN PHASE.
utt_0079 utt 507.81 516.55 -X AND WE CAN ALSO SEE THIS BEHAVIOR. WE LOOK AT A QUALITATIVE EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE A NOISY INPUT SIGNAL ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE.
utt_0080 utt 516.67 524.13 -X AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIRST OR THE THIRD HARMONIC, WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S BARELY VISIBLE IN THE NOISY SIGNAL.
utt_0081 utt 525.22 536.42 -X THEN ON THE IN THE MIDDLE WE CAN SEE AN ENHANCED VERSION USING A COMPLEX RATIO MASK, AND HERE WE CAN SEE THAT IT REALLY STRUGGLES TO RECONSTRUCT THIS HARMONIC.
utt_0083 utt 537.06 541.91 -X FINALLY, ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE, DEEP FILTERING IS ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THIS HARMONIC
utt_0084 utt 542.50 546.66 -X FAIRLY GOOD, SO, THIS IN THE END SOUNDS MORE NATURAL.
utt_0085 utt 546.66 556.36 -X WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO RELATED WORK. HERE, WE HAVE PERCEPNET, WHICH ALSO USES A PERCEPTUAL APPROACH.
utt_0086 utt 556.58 565.54 -X SIMILAR ERB BAND FIRST STAGE AND FOR THE SECOND STAGE USES A COMB FILTER ENHANCE THE PERIODIC COMPONENT. THEN, DCCRN
utt_0088 utt 567.78 574.18 -X COMPLEX U-NET LIKE NETWORK, WHICH OPERATES IN THE COMPLEX DOMAIN. AND DCCRN PLUS
utt_0089 utt 576.00 580.94 -X HAS SOME IMPROVEMENTS ALSO, INCLUDING DEEP FILTERING SO THEY USE DEEP FILTERING IN THE OUTPUT.
utt_0090 utt 581.00 594.54 -X AND A FINALLY DEEPFILTERNET, A COMPARES REALLY OR PROVIDES A REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE COMPLEXITY TRADE-OF GIVEN THE REALLY LOW AMOUNT OF MULTIPLY ADD OPERATIONS.
utt_0092 utt 594.95 601.03 -X WE GET A REALLY GOOD PERFORMANCE ON PESQ ON THE VOICE BANK DEMAND DATA SET.
utt_0093 utt 601.03 609.74 -X WE HAVE CODE! SO WE PROVIDE FULL CODE FOR A TRAINING AND EVALUATION OF THIS
utt_0094 utt 610.37 623.31 -X FRAMEWORK, AS WELL AS SOME PRETRAINED NETWORK WEIGHTS. WE ALSO PROVIDE DATALOADING FRAMEWORK INCLUDING: ISTFT STFT LOOP WRITTEN IN RUST, WHICH CAN BE EASILY
utt_0096 utt 623.31 629.13 -X USED FROM PYTORCH. SO THIS GO, CHACK IT OUT ON GITHUB, WE HAVE SOME NEW COOL STUFF.
utt_0097 utt 629.13 634.22 -X THERE AS WELL. ALSO, WE HAVE SOME AUDIO SAMPLES ONLINE WHERE WE COMPARE
utt_0098 utt 635.43 640.17 -X FIRST STAGE ONLY THAN DEEP FILTERIN USING A FIRST STAGE AND A CRM STAGE.
utt_0099 utt 640.58 646.89 -X AS WELL AS FINNALY USING THE FIRST STAGE AND A DEEP FILTERING AS SECOND STAGE.
utt_0100 utt 646.89 654.35 -X SO HERE, YOU CAN LISTEN TO THOSE DIFFERENT OUTPUTS. FINALLY, I WANT TO SHOW YOU A DEMO.
utt_0101 utt 655.94 660.94 -X SO, LET'S SEE HOW A DEEP FILTER NET ENHANCES MY VOICE.
utt_0102 utt 662.06 668.65 -X HERE, WE CAN RECORD AN AUDIO SIGNAL OR A SPEECH SIGNAL. OR ALSO UPLOAD THIS DIFFERENT SPEECH SIGNAL.
utt_0103 utt 669.61 673.42 -X THIS WILL BE MIXED WITH A NOISE WHICH YOU CAN ALSO UPLOAD YOUR OWN NOISES.
utt_0107 utt 681.39 684.91 -6.4984 LET'S SEE HOW DEEP FILTER NET ENHANCES MY VOICE. YOU CAN HEAR THAT MOST OF THE NOISE IS REMOVED.
