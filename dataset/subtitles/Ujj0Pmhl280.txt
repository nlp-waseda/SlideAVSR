utt_0000 utt 0.30 10.26 -X HELLO, I'M NAMI OGAWA AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOKYO, JAPAN. I'VE MADE A PRESENTATION OF OUR PAPER ON BEHALF OF THE CO-AUTHORS. THE SCRIPT FOR THIS TALK WILL BE READ BY
utt_0002 utt 12.20 13.39 -X AMAZON POLLY.
utt_0003 utt 15.76 27.28 -X ROOM-SCALE VR ALLOWS USERS TO WALK AROUND FREELY WHILE REFLECTING THEIR ACTUAL MOVEMENTS IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. SUCH A NATURAL WALKING EXPERIENCE IMPROVES THE USERS SENSE OF PRESENCE, BUT SOMETIMES IT IS NECESSARY
utt_0006 utt 27.28 40.72 -X TO LIMIT THE USERS MOVEMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE USER DOES NOT BUMP INTO ANY REAL-LIFE OBSTACLES, SINCE EMPTY SPACE IN A REAL ROOM IS TYPICALLY LIMITED. THEREFORE, A VIRTUAL WALL IS USUALLY DISPLAYED TO
utt_0009 utt 40.72 49.14 -X INDICATE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE SAFE AREA. HOWEVER, AS THE VIRTUAL WALLS DO NOT PHYSICALLY OBSTRUCT USERS, THE USER OFTEN TRIES TO WALK THROUGH THE VIRTUAL WALLS.
utt_0011 utt 49.52 61.78 -X CONSIDERING THESE SAFETY AND DESIGN CONSTRAINTS, PREVENTING USERS FROM WALKING THROUGH VIRTUAL WALLS IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN A ROOM-SCALE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. SO FAR, FEW ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO
utt_0014 utt 61.78 74.13 -X SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. WHILE CONVENTIONAL VIDEO GAMES LIMIT THE MOVEMENT OF VIRTUAL CHARACTERS AND CAMERAS, THE SAME STRATEGY CANNOT SIMPLY BE APPLIED TO ROOM-SCALE VR AS ASYNCHRONOUS MOVEMENTS BETWEEN THE USER AND THE VIRTUAL CAMERA
utt_0017 utt 74.13 87.75 -X CAN CAUSE MOTION SICKNESS. TURK DECK IS A TECHNIQUE FOR PROVIDING PHYSICAL FEEDBACK ON A VIRTUAL WALL, BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRACTICAL AS IT REQUIRES A LOT OF MANPOWER. RECENTLY, BOLDT ET AL. HAVE SHOWN THAT A COMBINATION OF VISUAL, AUDITORY
utt_0020 utt 87.75 92.92 -X AND VIBROTACTILE FEEDBACK FOR WALL COLLISIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING USERS FROM WALKING THROUGH WALLS.
utt_0022 utt 93.04 102.71 -X HOWEVER, IT CAN DISRUPT THE SENSE OF IMMERSION. THUS, THE EXISTING APPROACHES TO ROOM-SCALE VR ESSENTIALLY RELIES ON EXPLICIT SENSORY FEEDBACK FROM WALL COLLISIONS.
utt_0024 utt 103.06 111.57 -X IN CONTRAST, THIS STUDY AIMS TO GUIDE THE USERS' BEHAVIOR WITHOUT EXPLICIT FEEDBACK OR INSTRUCTION FOR WALL COLLISIONS. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
utt_0026 utt 112.11 116.66 -X OUR IDEA IS TO ENCOURAGE THE USERS TO BEHAVE REALISTICALLY IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0027 utt 116.98 121.56 -X IN OTHER WORDS, WE AIM TO ENCOURAGE THE USERS TO INSTINCTIVELY AVOID HITTING THE WALLS,
utt_0028 utt 121.56 131.16 -X WHICH IS A NATURAL BEHAVIOR TOWARD WALLS. IN THE REAL WORLD, NO ONE WOULD TRY TO BUMP INTO A WALL, WOULD THEY? SO, HOW CAN WE IMPLICITLY AFFECT THE USER'S BEHAVIOR?
utt_0030 utt 131.22 136.76 -X TO PUT IT DIFFERENTLY, WHAT DETERMINES THE WAY THE USERS BEHAVE IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT?
utt_0031 utt 136.76 139.35 -X THE KEY TO OUR IDEA IS THE SENSE OF PRESENCE.
utt_0032 utt 139.67 153.91 -X PRESENCE IS COMMONLY DEFINED AS THE SENSE OF BEING THERE BUT IT IS ALSO OPERATIONALLY DEFINED AS THE STATE IN WHICH THE USER RESPONDS REALISTICALLY TO EVENTS IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. HERE, THE RESPONSE CAN BE SUBJECTIVE, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL.
utt_0035 utt 153.91 161.53 -X IN OTHER WORDS, IF PARTICIPANTS IN THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT BEHAVE AS IF THEY WERE IN AN EQUIVALENT REAL ENVIRONMENT, THIS IS A SIGN OF PRESENCE.
utt_0037 utt 161.53 175.72 -X THEREFORE, WE ASSUME THAT INDUCING A HIGHER LEVEL OF PRESENCE WOULD DISCOURAGE THE USERS FROM WALKING THROUGH WALLS. THIS IS BECAUSE IF THE USERS BELIEVE THAT THE VIRTUAL WALL ACTUALLY EXISTS, THEY WON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PASSING THROUGH IT. IN PRESENCE RESEARCH, THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REALISM
utt_0041 utt 175.72 188.22 -X OF SELF AVATARS HAS LONG BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, WE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THE SELF AVATARS TO ENHANCE THE SENSE OF PRESENCE AND INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THE APPEARANCE OF THE SELF AVATARS ON THE USER'S WALK-THROUGH-WALL BEHAVIOR.
utt_0044 utt 188.22 200.76 -X NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS KNOWN SO FAR ABOUT THE EFFECT OF SELF AVATAR APPEARANCES. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE VISIBILITY OF THE SELF AVATAR AFFECTS THE SENSE OF PRESENCE, SPECIFICALLY WHEN
utt_0047 utt 200.76 214.49 -X A SELF AVATAR IS DISPLAYED. USERS FEEL A GREATER SENSE OF PRESENCE THAN WHEN A SELF AVATAR IS NOT DISPLAYED. HOWEVER, IN RECENT VR APPLICATIONS, RATHER THAN NOT DISPLAYING ANY SELF AVATARS AT ALL, IT IS COMMON TO DISPLAY AT LEAST PARTIAL SELF
utt_0050 utt 214.49 223.67 -X AVATARS SUCH AS CONTROLLERS AND VIRTUAL HANDS. THEREFORE, WE DECIDED TO COMPARE PARTIAL AND FULL-BODY REPRESENTATIONS AS A FACTOR OF VISIBILITY IN THIS STUDY.
utt_0052 utt 223.67 235.90 -X ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE REALISM OF A SELF AVATAR HAVE BEEN WELL STUDIED RECENTLY IN STUDIES ON THE SENSE OF EMBODIMENT RATHER THAN PRESENCE STUDIES. A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF
utt_0055 utt 235.90 248.70 -X A SELF-AVATAR AFFECTS THE SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP, WHICH IS THE SENSE OF ONE'S SELF-ATTRIBUTION OF A BODY. FUNDAMENTALLY, THE CLOSER THE APPEARANCE OF A SELF AVATAR IS TO ONE'S OWN BODY, THE STRONGER THE SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP WILL BE.
utt_0058 utt 248.70 257.28 -X HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF FULL-BODY SELF AVATARS, THE UNCANNY VALLEY EFFECT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN RECENT STUDIES OF BODY OWNERSHIP ILLUSIONS. IN ADDITION,
utt_0060 utt 257.28 265.76 -X FOR PRESENCE, THE EFFECTS OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE COMPLEX AND DEPENDENT ON THE GENDER OF THE USER. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO A VISIBILITY FACTOR,
utt_0062 utt 265.76 273.88 -X WE DECIDED TO COMPARE ABSTRACT AND REALISTIC SELF-AVATARS AS AN ANTHROPOMORPHISM FACTOR. CONSIDERING THESE BACKGROUNDS,
utt_0064 utt 273.88 282.65 -X WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE APPEARANCES OF A SELF-AVATAR AFFECT THE USER'S WALK-THROUGH-WALL BEHAVIORS IN A ROOM-SCALE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0066 utt 282.65 293.79 -X THE HYPOTHESIS IS THAT SELF-AVATARS WITH HIGHER VISUAL FIDELITY INCREASE THE USERS' SENSE OF PRESENCE AND MAKE THE PARTICIPANTS MORE LIKELY TO BEHAVE IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT IN THE SAME WAY AS THEY WOULD IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT,
utt_0069 utt 293.79 296.61 -X THAT IS, MORE LIKELY TO AVOID COLLISIONS WITH WALLS.
utt_0070 utt 297.02 301.44 -X CONVERSELY, SELF-AVATARS WITH LOWER VISUAL FIDELITY DECREASE THE USERS'
utt_0071 utt 301.44 313.12 -X SENSE OF PRESENCE AND MAKE THE PARTICIPANTS LESS LIKELY TO BEHAVE IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AS THEY WOULD IN A REAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT IS, MORE LIKELY TO WALK THROUGH WALLS. IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, I'LL EXPLAIN THE TASK AND THE
utt_0074 utt 313.12 317.95 -X DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENT. THE TASK WAS TO PUSH BUTTONS IN NUMERICAL ORDER.
utt_0075 utt 317.95 326.43 -X HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL SCENE. THE SUCCESSIVE BUTTONS WERE SPATIALLY CLOSED BUT SEPARATED BY THE WALL, SO THE PARTICIPANTS HAD TO WALK BACK AND FORTH.
utt_0077 utt 326.84 330.46 -X HOWEVER, AS YOU CAN SEE, THIS WAS TIME-CONSUMING AND EXHAUSTING,
utt_0078 utt 330.46 345.34 -X SO, SOME PARTICIPANTS TOOK THE SHORTCUT BY WALKING THROUGH THE WALL. IN THIS WAY, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO WALK THROUGH THE WALLS WHILE PERFORMING A TASK IN A TOTAL OF FOUR ROOMS. WE DESIGNED THE ROOM SO THAT THE INCENTIVE
utt_0081 utt 345.34 348.99 -X TO PASS THROUGH THE WALLS GOT GREATER AS THE PARTICIPANTS MOVED ON TO THE NEXT ROOM.
utt_0082 utt 349.40 353.25 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THE VIDEO SHOWN IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE REPRESENTED ROOM two.
utt_0083 utt 353.53 365.31 -X IN CONTRAST, ROOM one HAD A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF BUTTONS, SO THE INCENTIVES WERE RELATIVELY SMALL. ROOM three, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAD BUTTONS THAT THEY COULDN'T PRESS UNLESS THEY WALKED THROUGH AN AUTOMATIC SLIDING WALL.
utt_0086 utt 367.77 378.98 -X ROOM four ALSO COULD NOT BE COMPLETED WITHOUT WALKING THROUGH THE WALL, AND THIS WAS MORE EXPLICIT THAN ROOM three. BUT, THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ROOM four WAS TO PROVIDE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THREATENING STIMULI TO ASSESS THEIR
utt_0089 utt 378.98 384.42 -X PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES. IN ADDITION, WE SET A TIME LIMIT FOR EACH ROOM.
utt_0090 utt 384.42 389.51 -X THESE TASKS AND ROOMS WERE DESIGNED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STUDY BY BOLDT ET AL.
utt_0091 utt 389.51 396.58 -X THE PARTICIPANTS' FULL-BODY MOVEMENTS WERE TRACKED BY THREE TRACKERS AND HAND-HELD CONTROLLERS, AND REFLECTED IN THEIR SELF-AVATAR IN INVERSE KINEMATICS.
utt_0093 utt 396.93 410.18 -X AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT, THE PARTICIPANTS HAD thirty SECONDS TO LOOK IN THE VIRTUAL MIRROR WHILE MOVING THEIR BODIES FREELY. THIS PROCEDURE WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE EMBODIMENT OF THE SELF-AVATAR. WE PREPARED FOUR TYPES OF AVATARS,
utt_0096 utt 410.18 414.79 -X AND EACH PARTICIPANT WAS ASSIGNED TO ANY ONE OF THE FOUR. FOR THE REALISTIC AVATARS,
utt_0097 utt 414.79 419.65 -X WE USED AVATARS THAT MATCHED THE GENDER OF THE PARTICIPANTS. IN THIS WAY,
utt_0098 utt 419.65 427.49 -X THE EXPERIMENT FOLLOWED A twoXtwo BETWEEN-SUBJECTS DESIGN THAT CONTROLLED THE APPEARANCE OF SELF-AVATARS, NAMELY, ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND VISIBILITY.
utt_0100 utt 427.49 440.74 -X WE ANALYZED THE TENDENCY OF THE PARTICIPANTS TO WALK THROUGH THE WALLS IN EACH ROOM USING MOTION TRACKING DATA. THIS BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS WAS THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF THE EXPERIMENT. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZED SUBJECTIVE SCORES FOR PRESENCE
utt_0103 utt 440.74 452.87 -X AND BODY OWNERSHIP USING A QUESTIONNAIRE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO THE VIRTUAL THREATS USING THE SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSE AS AN INDICATOR OF THE SENSE OF PRESENCE AND BODY OWNERSHIP. HOWEVER, PHYSIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS WILL BE
utt_0106 utt 452.87 466.84 -X OMITTED IN THIS TALK, SO PLEASE READ THE PAPER FOR DETAILS. SO FAR, I'VE EXPLAINED THE METHODS. NOW, WHAT ARE THE RESULTS? HERE YOU CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF THE BEHAVIORAL DATA. THESE GRAPHS SHOW THE PERCENTAGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS BY
utt_0109 utt 466.84 480.20 -X BEHAVIORAL PATTERN BY THE TYPE OF AVATAR IN EACH ROOM. FIRST, LET'S COMPARE THE DISTRIBUTIONS BY ROOM TO FIGURE OUT THE GENERAL TREND. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORANGE AREA, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO WALK THROUGH THE WALL,
utt_0112 utt 480.20 491.86 -X YOU CAN SEE THAT MORE AND MORE PARTICIPANTS WALK THROUGH THE WALLS AS THE EXPERIMENT PROGRESSED. THIS INDICATES THAT EACH ROOM COULD GIVE INCENTIVES TO WALK THROUGH THE WALL TO THE PARTICIPANTS, AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, WHAT IS
utt_0115 utt 491.86 505.34 -X MORE IMPORTANT HERE IS THE DIFFERENCE IN DISTRIBUTION BY AVATAR TYPE. THUS, LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE GRAPH FOR ROOM two, WHERE THE EFFECTIVE SELF-AVATAR IS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED. IN ROOM two, THE PARTICIPANTS' BEHAVIORS
utt_0118 utt 505.34 509.22 -X WERE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE CATEGORIES: one. WALKING THROUGH THE WALL,
utt_0119 utt 511.81 516.17 -X two. PENETRATING THEIR HAND INTO THE WALL BUT NEVER WALKING THROUGH THE WALL,
utt_0120 utt 517.32 524.68 -X AND three. NEITHER TOUCHING NOR WALKING THROUGH THE WALL, THAT IS, WALKING AROUND THE WALL.
utt_0121 utt 524.68 536.49 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, THE REALISTIC FULL-BODY SELF-AVATAR WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR DISCOURAGING THE PARTICIPANTS FROM PENETRATING THE WALLS, WHICH SUPPORTED THE HYPOTHESIS. ANOTHER INTERESTING RESULT WAS THAT
utt_0124 utt 536.49 540.04 -X THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE HUMAN-HAND AVATAR WERE LIKELY TO WALK THROUGH THE WALLS,
utt_0125 utt 540.04 544.01 -X ALTHOUGH THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE CONTROLLER AVATAR DID NOT SHOW SUCH A TENDENCY.
utt_0126 utt 545.41 548.55 -X WHAT ABOUT ANOTHER ROOM? LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ROOM three.
utt_0127 utt 549.06 560.47 -X THE REALISTIC FULL-BODY SELF-AVATAR ALSO SEEMED TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ROOM three, BUT A SIMPLE BINARY COUNTING IS NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY CAPTURE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR. HOW CAN WE GET A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF
utt_0131 utt 564.78 570.67 -X SOME TOOK A LONG TIME TO FINALLY WALK THROUGH THE WALL, WHILE OTHERS WALK THROUGH THE WALL IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT HESITATION.
utt_0133 utt 570.67 582.86 -X THEREFORE, WE ANALYZED WHEN THE PARTICIPANTS FIRST WALKED THROUGH THE WALL IN ROOM three. HERE, WE HAVE THE GRAPH SHOWING HOW LONG IT TOOK THE PARTICIPANTS TO WALK THROUGH THE WALL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ROOM three BY AVATAR TYPE.
utt_0136 utt 583.24 590.38 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A REALISTIC FULL-BODY SELF-AVATAR TOOK MORE TIME TO WALK THROUGH THE WALLS THAN THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS.
utt_0138 utt 590.70 603.05 -X WHAT IS INTERESTING HERE IS THAT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DATA ON THE PARTICIPANTS WHO DID NOT WALK THROUGH THE WALL. WE PERFORMED A SIMILAR ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS FOR THE OTHER ROOMS AS WELL, BUT RATIOS WERE NOT THE MAIN
utt_0141 utt 603.05 606.32 -X INDICATOR FOR THESE ROOMS, SO PLEASE READ THE PAPER FOR THE RESULTS.
utt_0142 utt 607.56 617.90 -X FINALLY, USING THE TIME INDICATOR, WE ANALYZE THE TIME IT TOOK FOR THE PARTICIPANTS TO FIRST WALK THROUGH THE WALL THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT AS AN INDICATOR OF BEHAVIORAL TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT.
utt_0145 utt 618.95 630.41 -X HERE IS THE GRAPH SHOWING THE TIME IT TOOK FOR THE PARTICIPANTS TO FIRST WALK THROUGH THE WALL THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A REALISTIC FULL-BODY SELF-AVATAR TOOK LONGER TO WALK THROUGH
utt_0148 utt 630.41 634.83 -X THE WALLS THAN THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS, EVEN THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT.
utt_0149 utt 634.83 643.37 -X SO FAR, I'VE SHOWN THE RESULTS OF THE BEHAVIOURAL DATA ANALYSIS, WHICH IS THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE EXPERIMENT. TO PUT IT SIMPLY, AS EVIDENT FROM THE RATIO IN ROOM two,
utt_0151 utt 643.40 655.57 -X TIME IN ROOM three, AND TIME ACROSS ROOMS, THE RESULTS CONSISTENTLY SHOWED THAT PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD THE FULL-BODY HUMAN AVATAR TENDED TO REFRAIN FROM WALKING THROUGH THE WALLS. THESE SUPPORTED OUR HYPOTHESIS THAT
utt_0154 utt 655.57 659.98 -X SELF-AVATARS WITH HIGHER VISUAL FIDELITY MAKE USERS LESS LIKELY TO WALK THROUGH WALLS.
utt_0155 utt 660.11 664.24 -X YET, IT'S NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER THIS EFFECT IS DUE TO THE SENSE OF PRESENCE.
utt_0156 utt 664.36 669.01 -X LET'S TURN TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS. THESE GRAPHS SHOW THE PARTICIPANTS'
utt_0157 utt 669.01 681.84 -X SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF SENSE OF PRESENCE AND SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP FOR EACH SELF-AVATAR. FOR PRESENCE, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AVATAR CONDITIONS, UNLIKE BEHAVIORAL DATA. THE RESULTS DID NOT SUPPORT OUR HYPOTHESIS
utt_0160 utt 681.84 693.34 -X THAT THE MORE REALISTIC AND VISIBLE THE SELF AVATARS, THE STRONGER THE SENSE OF PRESENCE THEY INDUCED. IN ADDITION, THE PARTICIPANTS WITH ABSTRACT AVATARS WERE SHOWN TO HAVE A STRONGER SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP THAN THOSE WITH
utt_0163 utt 693.34 706.13 -X REALISTIC AVATARS. THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWING THAT REALISTIC SELF-AVATARS INDUCE A GREATER SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP THAN ABSTRACT SELF AVATARS. THEN, DOES PRESENCE HAVE NOTHING TO DO
utt_0166 utt 706.13 714.77 -X WITH BEHAVIOR? IN FACT, A CORRELATION ANALYSIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT WEAK CORRELATION BETWEEN PRESENCE AND BEHAVIOR INDICES. IN ADDITION,
utt_0168 utt 714.77 727.22 -X MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT ONLY THE SCORE OF PRESENCE TENDED TO PREDICT THE PARTICIPANTS' BEHAVIOR AMONG THE VARIABLES FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE DATA. IN LINE WITH OUR HYPOTHESIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT
utt_0171 utt 727.22 740.26 -X THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A HIGHER SENSE OF PRESENCE TENDED TO TAKE A LONGER TIME TO WALK THROUGH THE WALL. IN THE NEXT SLIDE, I'D LIKE TO SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS OF OUR EXPERIMENT. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE REALISTIC FULL-BODY SELF-AVATAR
utt_0174 utt 740.26 754.74 -X WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN DISCOURAGING THE PARTICIPANTS FROM PENETRATING THE WALLS. IN ADDITION, THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A HIGHER SENSE OF PRESENCE TENDED TO REFRAIN FROM PASSING THROUGH THE WALLS, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PRESENCE ACROSS AVATAR CONDITIONS.
utt_0178 utt 755.12 763.76 -X THESE RESULTS SUPPORT OUR IDEA THAT SELF-AVATARS WITH HIGHER FIDELITY CAN DISCOURAGE USERS FROM WALKING THROUGH VIRTUAL WALLS WITHOUT EXPLICIT FEEDBACK.
utt_0180 utt 763.76 768.15 -X YET, THERE ARE SOME UNEXPECTED RESULTS THAT WARRANT FURTHER DISCUSSION.
utt_0181 utt 768.15 779.86 -X FOR INSTANCE, THE RATIO INDEX IN ROOM two SHOWED THAT PARTICIPANTS WITH THE HUMAN-HAND AVATAR WERE MORE LIKELY TO WALK THROUGH THE WALLS, WHILE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE CONTROLLER AVATAR DID NOT SHOW SUCH A TREND. THIS RESULT WAS CONTRARY TO
utt_0184 utt 779.86 787.96 -X EXPECTATIONS AS THE CONTROLLER AVATAR SHOULD BE FARTHEST AWAY FROM THE FULL-BODY, REALISTIC AVATAR IN TERMS OF VISUAL RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN BODY.
utt_0186 utt 787.96 801.17 -X HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN THIS RESULT? THIS MAY BE RELATED TO THE UNEXPECTED RESULTS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWING THAT THE ABSTRACT SELF AVATARS EVOKED A STRONGER SENSE OF BODY OWNERSHIP THAN THE REALISTIC SELF AVATARS. ONE POSSIBLE REASON FOR THIS IS
utt_0189 utt 801.17 810.79 -X THE UNCANNY VALLEY EFFECT. THIS COULD EXPLAIN THE RESULTS ESPECIALLY THE COMPARISON BETWEEN FULL-BODY AVATARS. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF HAND ONLY AVATARS
utt_0191 utt 810.79 824.92 -X THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBLE REASON. IT IS AN INPUT MODALITY, IN THIS STUDY, AS THE PARTICIPANTS HELD THE ACTUAL CONTROLLERS, THE CONTROLLER AVATARS MAY BE MORE REALISTIC THAN HUMAN-HAND AVATARS. IN FACT, PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN
utt_0194 utt 824.92 837.78 -X THE EFFECT OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM OF VIRTUAL HANDS USUALLY USE HAND-TRACKING SENSORS INSTEAD OF CONTROLLERS. THEREFORE, THE INCLUSION OF INPUT MODALITY AS A FACTOR IS A FUTURE PROSPECT. FUTURE STUDIES ALSO INCLUDE IMPROVING PRESENCE
utt_0197 utt 837.78 842.78 -X BY USING OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS PASSIVE HAPTICS AND AVATAR PERSONALIZATION.
utt_0198 utt 842.78 855.10 -X FINALLY, WHAT DO OUR RESULTS TELL US ABOUT THE EFFECT OF SELF AVATARS ON USER BEHAVIOR IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS MORE GENERALLY? THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT SELF AVATARS WITH HIGH VISUAL FIDELITY INDUCE REALISTIC
utt_0201 utt 855.10 858.14 -X USER BEHAVIOR, PRESUMABLY THROUGH A HIGHER SENSE OF PRESENCE.
utt_0202 utt 858.52 871.90 -X THEREFORE, THIS STUDY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO VR APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE REALISTIC USER RESPONSES IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS, SUCH AS A TRAINING SYSTEM. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT A VR DESIGNER CAN IMPLICITLY ENCOURAGE USERS TO BEHAVE
utt_0205 utt 871.90 886.62 -X REALISTICALLY OR UNREALISTICALLY DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION BY SIMPLY CHANGING THE SELF-AVATARS. THE FINDINGS CAN BE APPLIED TO BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TECHNIQUES FOR TREATING PHOBIAS, ANXIETY, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, WHICH INCLUDES GRADED EXPOSURE OF THE PATIENT TO STIMULI.
utt_0209 utt 886.62 897.79 -X I'D LIKE TO FINISH BY SHOWING THE RECAP OF THIS TALK. THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THE VIDEO. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME!
