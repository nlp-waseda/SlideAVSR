utt_0000 utt 2.00 11.18 -X HI, MY NAME IS PAOLA VALDIVIA AND I WILL PRESENT OUR WORK ANALYZING DYNAMIC HYPERGRAPHS WITH PARALLEL AGGREGATED ORDERED HYPERGRAPH VISUALIZATION.
utt_0002 utt 11.18 15.06 -X THIS IS IN COLLABORATION WITH PAOLO BUONO, CATHERINE PLAISANT,
utt_0003 utt 15.15 17.94 -X NICOLE DUFOURNAUD AND JEAN DANIEL FEKETE.
utt_0004 utt 19.31 21.97 -X SO, WHAT IS A HYPERGRAPH?
utt_0005 utt 21.97 26.77 -X A HYPERGRAPH IS A GENERALIZATION OF A GRAPH WHERE LINKS CAN CONNECT ANY NUMBER OF NODES.
utt_0006 utt 27.18 30.35 -X AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM A NORMAL GRAPH?
utt_0007 utt 30.35 33.91 -X WHY DO THEY NEED A SPECIAL VISUALIZATION?
utt_0008 utt 33.91 38.58 -X LET'S SEE HOW CAN WE REPRESENT A WHO KNOWS WHO GRAPH USING A NODE-LINK DIAGRAM.
utt_0009 utt 39.09 41.52 -X IN THIS NORMAL GRAPH, WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE
utt_0010 utt 41.55 44.88 -X AND WE HAVE AN EDGE IF TWO PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER.
utt_0011 utt 45.26 49.81 -X WE SEE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYBODY ELSE.
utt_0012 utt 49.81 51.70 -X NOW, LET'S LOOK AT A HYPERGRAPH.
utt_0013 utt 52.81 59.35 -X NODES ARE THE SAME FOUR PEOPLE BUT NOW EACH HYPEREDGE REPRESENTS AN ARTICLE.
utt_0014 utt 59.35 65.20 -X THE FIRST ONE WAS WRITTEN BY CATHERINE AND JEAN-DANIEL, THE SECOND BY CATHERINE AND PAOLO,
utt_0015 utt 65.71 70.42 -X A THIRD ONE, AND A FOURTH.
utt_0016 utt 70.42 74.16 -X SADLY, IT LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE WHO-KNOWS-WHO GRAPH
utt_0017 utt 76.40 81.11 -X SO, HOW CAN WE REVEAL HYPEREDGES?
utt_0018 utt 81.11 84.53 -X ONE APPROACH WILL BE TO USE A DIFFERENT COLOR FOR EACH ARTICLE
utt_0019 utt 86.29 89.17 -X OR WE CAN REPRESENT ARTICLES AS SETS.
utt_0020 utt 90.51 95.06 -X NOW, YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WITH A HIGHER NUMBER OF AUTHORS AND ARTICLES,
utt_0021 utt 95.06 100.24 -X WE WOULD EASILY RUN OUT OF COLORS, THE REPRESENTATION WILL START TO LOOK CLUTTERED,
utt_0022 utt 100.24 105.81 -X AND MAKING SENSE OF THE VISUALIZATION WILL BECOME CHALLENGING.
utt_0023 utt 105.81 109.91 -X ANOTHER WAY OF VISUALIZING HYPERGRAPHS IS BY USING A BIPARTITE NETWORK,
utt_0024 utt 110.07 113.59 -X WHERE A DIFFERENT ENCODING IS USED FOR EACH TYPE OF NODE.
utt_0025 utt 114.26 119.22 -X IN THIS CASE, THE NODES ARE AUTHORS AND ARTICLES.
utt_0026 utt 119.35 123.29 -X BUT LET'S NOW DESCRIBE OUR PROPOSED TECHNIQUE TO VISUALIZE HYPERGRAPHS.
utt_0027 utt 123.54 127.77 -X AND LATER WE'LL SEE WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0028 utt 128.72 131.61 -X FIRSTLY, WE ALIGN ALL AUTHOR NAMES TO THE LEFT
utt_0029 utt 131.95 134.93 -X AND REPRESENT EACH ARTICLE AS A VERTICAL LINE.
utt_0030 utt 135.19 140.05 -X WE ADD A DOT IN TO INDICATE THAT THE PERSON IS A CO-AUTHOR OF THIS ARTICLE.
utt_0031 utt 140.05 145.34 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THIS ARTICLE HAS CATHERINE AND PAOLO AS CO-AUTHORS.
utt_0032 utt 146.20 149.59 -X WE ADD TWO MORE HYPEREDGES TO REPRESENT THE OTHER ARTICLES
utt_0033 utt 150.32 154.55 -X AND NOW WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE FOUR ARTICLES WITHOUT OVERLAPPING.
utt_0034 utt 155.41 158.97 -X AND WE CAN THEN EXAMINE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN ALL CO-AUTHORS.
utt_0035 utt 160.44 168.66 -X EVEN MORE, ASSUMING ALL OF THESE ARTICLES WERE PUBLISHED IN THE SAME YEAR, WE CAN GROUP THEM IN A TIME SLOT CALLED TIME one.
utt_0037 utt 169.49 174.55 -X AND WE CAN ADD MORE TIME SLOTS NEXT TO THIS ONE TO REPRESENT A DYNAMIC HYPERGRAPH.
utt_0038 utt 175.44 178.52 -X USING OUR REPRESENTATION, CALLED PAOHVIS,
utt_0039 utt 178.52 183.77 -X WE CAN ANALYZE IN DETAIL CONNECTIONS AND CHANGES IN THE COAUTHORSHIP RELATIONS OVER TIME.
utt_0040 utt 185.40 190.81 -X LET'S SEE NOW A CASE STUDY TO SEE HOW WE CAN USE PAOHVIS TO ANALYZE A DYNAMIC HYPERGRAPH.
utt_0041 utt 192.73 196.54 -X THIS CASE STUDY WAS LED BY NICOLE, A FRENCH HISTORIAN.
utt_0042 utt 197.08 201.72 -X SHE IS INTERESTED IN ANALYZING THE ROLE OF A MERCHANT, MARIE BOUCHER.
utt_0043 utt 202.10 206.14 -X THERE IS NO HISTORICAL INFORMATION ABOUT MARIE BOUCHER,
utt_0044 utt 206.14 211.13 -X BUT SHE IS MENTIONED IN fifty-nine LEGAL DOCUMENTS FROM THE sixteenTH AND seventeenTH CENTURIES.
utt_0045 utt 212.82 217.66 -X THE DATASET OF MARIE BOUCHER WAS COLLECTED, PROCESSED, AND ANALYZED BY NICOLE.
utt_0046 utt 218.29 224.22 -X WE WILL SEE HOW SHE PERFORMED HER ANALYSIS AND HOW SHE CAN PERFORM THE SAME ANALYSIS USING PAOHVIS.
utt_0051 utt 240.60 247.58 -X AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THIS IS A LONG AND COMPLICATED PROCESS THAT PRODUCES MEDIUM-SIZE NETWORKS OF ABOUT two hundred NODES.
utt_0053 utt 248.54 253.95 -X AFTER THAT, THE HISTORIAN PERFORMS A LONG, CAREFUL, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THIS DATASET.
utt_0054 utt 255.16 260.16 -X THE HISTORIAN HAD ALREADY ANALYZED HER DATASET WITH THE HELP OF TWO REPRESENTATIONS.
utt_0055 utt 261.72 270.46 -X THE FIRST ONE WAS A BIPARTITE GRAPH, WHERE SHE CAN SEE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS, BUT NO TEMPORAL INFORMATION.
utt_0057 utt 272.09 285.31 -X THE SECOND REPRESENTATION WAS A TIME ARCS VISUALIZATION MADE IN THE ONLINE TOOL THE VISTORIAN, WHERE SHE CAN SEE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PAIRS OF PERSONS OVER TIME, BUT THE DOCUMENT INFORMATION IS LOST.
utt_0060 utt 286.46 291.20 -X THAT MEANS, SHE CANNOT TELL IF TWO ARCS REPRESENT THE SAME DOCUMENT.
utt_0061 utt 292.70 298.46 -X USING PAOHVIS, SHE HAS THE LIST OF MERCHANTS AT THE LEFT, AND SHE CAN SEE EACH DOCUMENT,
utt_0062 utt 298.52 303.17 -X THE DETAIL OF WHO WAS MENTIONED IN EACH DOCUMENT, AND THE TEMPORAL INFORMATION.
utt_0063 utt 303.80 307.23 -X IN THIS CASE, EACH TIME SLOT REPRESENTS A YEAR.
utt_0064 utt 308.41 312.51 -X LET'S GO BACK TO UNDERSTAND HOW PAOHVIS WORKS WITH A SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE.
utt_0065 utt 314.33 319.84 -X IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE USER COLORED THE NODES BY FAMILY AND SELECTED THE FIRST NODE.
utt_0066 utt 322.01 326.43 -X THE USER SEES THAT THERE ARE two FAMILIES COLLIN AND DOS SANTOS.
utt_0067 utt 326.49 332.03 -X AND THEY CAN FURTHER SEE THAT ELISE HAS CONNECTIONS WITH ALL OF THE thirteen PEOPLE IN THIS DATASET,
utt_0068 utt 332.03 335.46 -X AND THAT SHE IS MENTIONED IN fourteen OUT OF nineteen DOCUMENTS.
utt_0069 utt 338.27 340.70 -X OK, NOW, LET'S GO BACK TO OUR CASE STUDY.
utt_0070 utt 343.45 349.02 -X IN THIS DATASET, WE SEE THAT THERE ARE fifty-nine DOCUMENTS REPRESENTED BY THE HYPEREDGES.
utt_0071 utt 349.69 353.09 -X THESE DOCUMENTS CORRESPOND TO A twenty-two YEAR PERIOD.
utt_0072 utt 354.94 361.06 -X WE HAVE one hundred and eighty-one PEOPLE, WHERE ONLY THE thirty-eight THAT APPEAR IN MORE THAN ONE DOCUMENT ARE LISTED.
utt_0073 utt 363.07 368.26 -X THE OTHER one hundred and forty-three PEOPLE ARE HINTED AS DRIPS, WHICH ARE THOSE SMALLER CIRCLES.
utt_0074 utt 369.63 375.97 -X WHEN WE HOVER OVER THE HYPEREDGE, ALL THE NAMES APPEAR, SO USERS CAN EXPLORE IN DETAIL,
utt_0075 utt 375.97 377.73 -X WHO APPEARS IN EACH DOCUMENT.
utt_0076 utt 380.09 390.66 -X SO, AS I SAID, IN THE PAST THE HISTORIAN HAS USED THIS TIME ARC REPRESENTATION TO EXPLORE THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PERSONS, BUT THE INFORMATION OF EACH DOCUMENT WAS LOST.
utt_0078 utt 391.26 397.09 -X SO, SHE MADE THE ASSUMPTION THAT TWO PERSONS CONNECTED THE SAME YEAR APPEARED ONLY IN ONE CONTRACT.
utt_0080 utt 397.54 404.32 -X HOWEVER, USING PAOHVIS, SHE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE DOCUMENTS INVOLVING THESE PEOPLE IN THE SAME YEAR.
utt_0082 utt 405.47 410.21 -X IN THE END, THE SAME ANALYSIS CAN BE DONE MORE ACCURATELY USING PAOHVIS.
utt_0083 utt 411.74 420.36 -X ANOTHER THING THAT SHE OBSERVED WAS THAT THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED STAGES IN THE MERCHANT LIFE OF MARIE BOUCHER ARE PRETTY EVIDENT USING PAOHVIS.
utt_0085 utt 421.86 425.99 -X AS SHE OBSERVED, AT THE BEGINNING, MARIE BOUCHER HAD ONLY BUSINESS IN FRANCE.
utt_0086 utt 426.59 429.70 -X LATER SHE STARTED TRANSATLANTIC BUSINESS.
utt_0087 utt 429.70 438.25 -X AND HER THIRD PERIOD WAS AN EXPANSION PHASE WHEN SHE ASSOCIATED WITH HUBERT ANTHEAUME TO FORM THE MARIE BOUCHER AND HUBER ANTHEAUME COMPANY.
utt_0089 utt 439.59 443.05 -X IN HER WORDS: THIS IS A TOOL TO VERIFY HYPOTHESES.
utt_0090 utt 443.62 445.80 -X IT GIVES IDEAS AND STRUCTURE THOUGHTS.
utt_0091 utt 445.95 451.27 -X IT PROVIDES NARRATIVE SUPPORT AND IS A USEFUL COMMUNICATION TOOL.
utt_0092 utt 451.27 455.08 -X NOW, LET’S LOOK AT SOME USEFUL INTERACTION TECHNIQUES IMPLEMENTED IN PAOHVIS.
utt_0093 utt 455.43 458.76 -X WE CAN HIGHLIGHT, SELECT, AND FILTER EDGES.
utt_0094 utt 460.13 465.89 -X BY CLICKING ON MARIE BOUCHER I SELECT HER AND FILTER THE EDGES TO SEE ONLY MARIE BOUCHER CONNECTIONS.
utt_0095 utt 471.27 474.73 -X I CAN REORDER THE NODES USING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES:
utt_0096 utt 476.13 484.87 -X BY DEFAULT, THE NAMES ARE ORDERED CHRONOLOGICALLY, WHICH MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO APPEAR IN THE EARLIEST DOCUMENTS APPEAR ON THE TOP OF THE LIST.
utt_0098 utt 486.69 492.81 -X OR WE CAN ORDER BY GROUP, IN THIS CASE, PEOPLE FROM THE SAME FAMILY ARE GROUPED TOGETHER.
utt_0099 utt 494.37 502.57 -X THE OPTION OF SHOWING GROUP NAMES ON THE LEFT ALLOWS US TO EDIT THE NAMES AND ALSO COLLAPSE THE GROUPS TO SEE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN GROUPS.
utt_0101 utt 502.66 506.79 -X LIKE IN THIS CASE, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO FAMILIES IS CLEARLY SHOWN.
utt_0102 utt 507.52 511.56 -X NOTICE THAT EACH AGGREGATED HYPEREDGE REMAINS A HYPEREDGE.
utt_0103 utt 513.57 518.92 -X TO IDENTIFY USABILITY PROBLEMS, GATHER FEEDBACK, AND IMPROVE PAOHVIS, WE PERFORMED A USABILITY
utt_0104 utt 518.98 522.15 -X STUDY WITH nine PARTICIPANTS.
utt_0105 utt 522.15 527.98 -X IT CONSISTED OF two PHASES: DISCOVERY AND TASK PHASE, EACH ONE LASTING AROUND two0 MINUTES.
utt_0106 utt 528.97 538.89 -X DURING THE DISCOVERY PHASE, PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED NO TRAINING, AND WERE ASKED TO DESCRIBE WHAT THEY WERE SEEING, AND THEN THEY WERE ASKED TO FREELY INTERACT WITH PAOHVIS.
utt_0108 utt 539.33 544.19 -X AFTER THAT, THEY PERFORMED six TASKS AND PROVIDED FEEDBACK AND SUGGESTIONS
utt_0109 utt 544.33 547.95 -X AFTER EACH PARTICIPANT, WE FIXED THE USABILITY ISSUES.
utt_0110 utt 548.39 552.94 -X DURING THE DISCOVERY PHASE, WE USED A SMALL COAUTHORSHIP NETWORK FROM THE ILDA TEAM.
utt_0111 utt 553.35 557.04 -X AT THE BEGINNING, WE DID NOT GIVE ACCESS TO THE INTERACTIVE FEATURES.
utt_0112 utt 557.58 561.16 -X STILL, PARTICIPANTS FIGURED OUT THE LAYOUT WITHOUT TRAINING.
utt_0113 utt 561.83 569.07 -X AFTER THEY COULD USE INTERACTION, THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD THE COLOR CODING AND THAT DRIPS REPRESENTED, FILTERED-OUT AUTHORS.
utt_0115 utt 569.51 576.75 -X AN EXAMPLE OF PROBLEMS WE NOTICED AND FIXED WAS THAT THE TERMS VERTEX AND HYPEREDGE WERE CONFUSING.
utt_0117 utt 576.84 581.84 -X SO WE REPLACE THEM BY CUSTOM TERMS LOADED WITH EACH DATASET.
utt_0118 utt 581.84 587.85 -X FOR EXAMPLE, INSTEAD OF VERTEX, WE SAY AUTHOR, INSTEAD OF HYPEREDGE, WE SAY PUBLICATION.
utt_0119 utt 588.68 591.37 -X SOME PARTICIPANTS WERE LOST AFTER FILTERING.
utt_0120 utt 591.43 595.92 -X SO WE ADDED A SIMPLE ANIMATION TO CLARIFY WHAT WAS BEING FILTERED OUT.
utt_0121 utt 596.33 604.37 -X FOR THE SECOND TEST PHASE, WE USED A LARGER COAUTHORSHIP NETWORK WITH twenty SEMESTERS OF THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE AVIZ AND THE ILDA TEAM.
utt_0123 utt 606.31 614.57 -X TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE, THE THIRD TASK WAS: LOOKING AT PETRA’S NETWORK, ARE THERE PAPERS WITH THE EXACT SAME CO-AUTHORS IN DIFFERENT SEMESTERS?
utt_0125 utt 614.67 617.20 -X TELL ME THE NAMES.
utt_0126 utt 617.20 622.96 -X ONE OF THE PARTICIPANT'S APPROACH TO SOLVING THIS TASK WAS TO FIRST LOCATE PETRA AND THEN FILTER OUT HER NETWORK.
utt_0128 utt 627.02 633.20 -X AFTER THAT, THE PARTICIPANT HIGHLIGHTED SIMILAR EDGES APPROACHING THE CURSOR TO EACH LINE.
utt_0129 utt 633.20 638.32 -X LIKE IN THIS CASE, ALL EDGES WHICH INCLUDE PETRA AND TOBIAS ISENBERG, MICHAEL SEDLMAIR,
utt_0130 utt 638.32 643.79 -X TORSTEN MOLLER AND JIAN CHEN ARE HIGHLIGHTED, WHICH IS A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS TASK.
utt_0131 utt 644.30 649.68 -X IN FACT, THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHLIGHTING SIMILAR EDGES WAS ADDED AFTER THE fiveTH PARTICIPANT.
utt_0132 utt 649.80 653.01 -X AND WAS USED BY three OF THE REMAINING four PARTICIPANTS.
utt_0133 utt 655.50 661.71 -X IN SUMMARY, PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO INTERPRET THE BASIC FEATURES OF PAOHVIS WITH NO TRAINING.
utt_0134 utt 662.64 667.34 -X MORE COMPLEX FEATURES NEED SOME TRAINING, FOR EXAMPLE WITH VIDEO DEMONSTRATIONS.
utt_0135 utt 668.01 680.43 -X IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING THAT PARTICIPANTS LIKED THE FILTERING FEATURE BECAUSE IT REDUCED CLUTTER, WHICH IS COHERENT WITH OUR INTUITION THAT PAOHVIS IS GOOD TO ANALYZE SMALL NETWORKS IN GREAT DETAIL.
utt_0138 utt 681.45 687.22 -X TO CONCLUDE, PAOHVIS ALLOWS TO DISPLAY DYNAMIC HYPERGRAPHS WITH NO OVERLAP OR CROSSINGS,
utt_0139 utt 687.22 689.07 -X MAKING IT VERY READABLE.
utt_0140 utt 690.35 694.61 -X PAOHVIS SHINES WITH MID-SIZE GRAPHS, AND ALLOWS DETAILED ANALYSIS.
utt_0141 utt 695.47 701.81 -X DRIPS AND FILTERS GO A LONG WAY TO DEAL WITH LARGER DATASETS, BUT COMPACTING AND GROUPING HELP TO SCALE FURTHER.
utt_0143 utt 703.50 706.67 -X SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR PAOHVIS?
utt_0144 utt 706.67 715.83 -X CLUSTERING IS IMPORTANT TO OUR USERS, THAT'S WHY WE DEVELOPED AN APPROACH FOR CLUSTERING THAT IS PRESENTED IN A VAST SESSION.
utt_0146 utt 715.83 720.28 -X WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP PAOHVIS AND ADD FEATURES THAT ARE USEFUL FOR OUR COLLABORATORS,
utt_0147 utt 720.34 722.77 -X MOSTLY SOCIAL SCIENTISTS.
utt_0148 utt 722.77 726.45 -X NEXT STEPS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHLIGHTING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TIME SLOTS,
utt_0149 utt 726.45 732.40 -X VISUALLY ENCODE NODE AND HYPEREDGE ATTRIBUTES, AND DYNAMIC CLUSTERING.
utt_0150 utt 732.43 735.06 -X PAOHVIS IS AVAILABLE AT THIS ADDRESS.
utt_0151 utt 735.06 736.47 -1.0086 THANK YOU!
