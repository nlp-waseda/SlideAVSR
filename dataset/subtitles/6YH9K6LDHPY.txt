utt_0000 utt 0.43 8.50 -X BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION BASED COMBINATORIAL ASSIGNMENT IS JOINED WORK BY JAKOB WEISSTEINER, MYSELF, JULIEN SIEMS AND SVEN SEUKEN
utt_0002 utt 8.52 13.78 -X I START THIS TALK BY GIVING YOU A ONE SENTENCE DESCRIPTION WHAT THIS PAPER IS ALL ABOUT:
utt_0003 utt 13.78 24.96 -X AI AUCTIONEERS THAT FEEL CURIOUS TO EXPLORE THE BIIDER'S PREFERENCE PERFORM BETTER IN COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS. HOW MUCH BETTER? BY APPROXIMATELY two hundred MILLION US
utt_0005 utt 24.96 29.74 -X DOLLAR IN THE CASE OF OUR SIMULATION OF THE fourG CANADIAN SPECTRUM AUCTION.
utt_0006 utt 30.16 41.04 -X THE TALK WILL BE STRUCTURED AS FOLLOWS: FIRST I WILL EXPLAIN YOU WHAT EVEN IS A COMBINATORIAL AUCTION (WHICH IS A SPECIAL CASE OF A COMBINATORIAL ASSIGNMENT) NEXT WE WILL DISCUSS
utt_0008 utt 41.04 46.59 -X HOW AI IS INCORPORATED OR MORE PRECISELY HOW NEURAL NETWORKS ARE INCORPORATED INTO THIS AUCTION
utt_0009 utt 46.73 53.30 -X AND THEN FINALLY WE WILL DISCUSS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER HOW TO MAKE THIS METHOD CURIOUS.
utt_0010 utt 53.77 59.54 -X I HOPE MOST OF YOU HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THIS POWERFUL FEELING OF CURIOSITY WHICH ACTIVELY
utt_0011 utt 60.11 71.35 -X MOTIVATES YOU TO TRY OUT COMPLETELY NEW THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE EXPLORED ALREADY, BUT HOW DO WE INCORPORATE THIS INTO AUCTIONS AND WHY DO WE THINK THIS IS BENEFICIAL,
utt_0013 utt 71.53 75.63 -X WHY DO WE THINK THIS IS WORTH SO MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS?
utt_0014 utt 75.69 81.59 -X BUT AS PROMISED, FIRST WE WILL START VERY SIMPLE BY EXPLAINING WHAT IS A COMBINATORIAL AUCTION.
utt_0015 utt 81.71 91.89 -X IMAGINE THAT I WANT TO SELL FIVE ITEMS TO MY THREE FRIENDS, BUT NOW YOU PROBABLY ASK YOURSELF IF MY FRIENDS ARE REALLY WILLING TO PAY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR A BANANA? AND NO,
utt_0017 utt 91.89 98.31 -X OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE NOT BUT WE STUDY SPECTRUM AUCTIONS, WHERE A GOVERNMENT IS SELLING LICENSES
utt_0018 utt 98.35 111.20 -X FOR CERTAIN FREQUENCIES TO MOBILE PHONE CARRIERS AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THESE LICENSES. IN PRACTICE WE HAVE MUCH MORE THAN FIVE ITEMS AND ALSO MORE THAN THREE
utt_0020 utt 111.20 116.18 -X BIDDERS BUT LET'S GET BACK TO THE SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHERE I SELL FIVE ITEMS TO MY THREE CO-AUTHORS.
utt_0021 utt 116.97 123.86 -X IN A COMBINATORIAL AUCTION I ASK THE BIDDERS FOR CERTAIN INFORMATION AND BASED ON THIS INFORMATION
utt_0022 utt 123.92 135.86 -X I HAVE A ALLOCATION RULE WHICH DECIDES HOW I ASSIGN THESE ITEMS TO THE BIDDERS BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY GAVE ME AND A PAYMENT RULE THAT DETERMINES HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO PAY ME FOR THAT
utt_0024 utt 135.86 148.15 -X IN RETURN. IN THIS EXAMPLE YOU CAN DIRECTLY SEE THAT NONE OF THE BIDDERS IS REALLY HAPPY WITH WHAT THEY GOT. FOR EXAMPLE HERE JAKOB AND JULIEN THEY BOTH ONLY GOT A SINGLE SHOE WHICH IS
utt_0026 utt 148.15 153.75 -X NOT REALLY OF VALUE TO THEM WITHOUT THE OTHER SHOE. SO THE QUESTION THAT WE ASK OURSELVES
utt_0027 utt 153.75 163.16 -X IS HOW CAN WE DESIGN A MECHANISM WHICH MAXIMIZES THEIR OVERALL HAPPINESS. AND NOW THE EXPERTS AMONG
utt_0028 utt 163.16 177.12 -X YOU PROBABLY THINK WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE, THIS IS ALREADY A SOLVED PROBLEM. VCG SOLVES EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM OF MAXIMIZING THE OVERALL SOCIAL WELFARE. SO WHAT IS VCG? VCG ALSO HAS ALLOCATION
utt_0030 utt 177.12 183.80 -X RULE AND A PAYMENT RULE AND IT HAS THE GUARANTEE THAT THE SOCIAL WELFARE IS MAXIMIZED. SO WHAT IS
utt_0031 utt 183.80 193.24 -X THE SOCIAL WELFARE? IN THIS CASE THE VALUE THIS ITEM HAS FOR JAKOB IS ONE DOLLAR WHICH CAN BE MORE
utt_0032 utt 193.24 199.92 -X THAN WHAT HE ACTUALLY PAID FOR IT AND THE SOCIAL WELFARE IS SIMPLY THE SUM OF ALL THE THESE VALUES,
utt_0033 utt 201.68 204.95 -X WHICH IN THIS CASE WOULD BE A SOCIAL WELFARE OF one hundred and six$.
utt_0034 utt 208.56 220.76 -X SO VCG IS ALSO OPTIMAL FOR MY GAME THEORETICAL POINT OF VIEWS AND IT'S ALWAYS OPTIMAL FOR THE BIDDERS TO REPORT THE TRUTH AND WE ALWAYS HAVE THE GUARANTEE THAT THIS SOCIAL WELFARE IS
utt_0036 utt 221.59 227.06 -X MAXIMIZED FOR VCG. SO THERE'S NOTHING WHICH WE COULD DO BETTER THAN VCG.
utt_0037 utt 227.83 236.60 -X SO NOW WHY DON'T WE JUST USE VCG? THE PROBLEM OF VCG IS THAT THE INFORMATION WE NEED FROM THE
utt_0038 utt 236.60 243.77 -X BIDDERS IS THEIR FULL VALUE FUNCTION. THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR EACH POSSIBLE BUNDLE
utt_0039 utt 244.15 254.68 -X THEIR VALUE FOR THIS BUNDLE AND THIS MEANS IN TOTAL THEY HAVE TO REPORT, IF YOU HAVE M ITEMS,
utt_0040 utt 254.68 267.51 -X two TO THE M VALUES. IN THE CASE OF FIVE ITEMS THIS WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM BUT IN THE CASE OF THE CANADIAN SPECTRUM AUCTION WHERE WE HAVE ninety-eight ITEMS, two TO THE ninety-eight IS A CRAZY LARGE NUMBER
utt_0042 utt 267.51 272.73 -X AND THIS WOULD BE NEVER POSSIBLE IN PRACTICE TO ASK EACH BIDDER SUCH A HIGH AMOUNT OF QUERIES,
utt_0043 utt 272.73 279.19 -X BECAUSE EACH OF THESE QUERIES IS VERY EXPENSIVE IN PRACTICE. IN TYPICAL APPLICATIONS WE CAN USE
utt_0044 utt 279.89 285.78 -X AT MOST five hundred QUERIES PER BIDDER AND WE WOULD STRONGLY PREFER TO ASK THEM LESS QUERIES,
utt_0045 utt 285.78 299.86 -X MORE SOMETHING LIKE one hundred QUERIES. SO THIS IS WHY WE USE MACHINE LEARNING BASED COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS WHICH ONLY ASK one hundred QUERIES PER BIDDER. SO WHAT IS A MACHINE LEARNING BASED COMBINATORIAL
utt_0047 utt 299.86 311.05 -X AUCTION? HERE WE ASK EACH BIDDER TO REPORT THEIR VALUES FOR TWO RANDOM BUNDLES IN THIS CASE SO
utt_0048 utt 312.72 323.51 -X EACH BIDDER GETS THE TWO RANDOM BUNDLES AND THEY REPORT THE VALUE FOR THIS. THEN BASED ON THIS DATA WE TRAIN AN INDIVIDUAL NEURAL NETWORK FOR EACH BIDDER WHICH SHOULD APPROXIMATE THEIR VALUE
utt_0050 utt 323.51 337.56 -X FUNCTION. SO FOR JAKOB WE TRAIN HIS NEURAL NETWORK BASED ON THE DATA HE PROVIDED US AND FOR JULIEN WE TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK BASED ON THIS DATA AND SO ON. AND THEN BASED ON THIS APPROXIMATE VALUE
utt_0052 utt 337.56 347.53 -X FUNCTIONS WE CAN RUN VCG. OR SO IN THIS CONTEXT THIS MEANS THAT WE OPTIMIZE WHICH ALLOCATION
utt_0053 utt 347.73 357.21 -X GIVES THE HIGHEST APPROXIMATE SOCIAL WELFARE SO THE HIGHEST SUM OF THE APPROXIMATE VALUES AND
utt_0054 utt 357.21 369.53 -X THIS IS IN THIS CASE FOR EXAMPLE THIS ALLOCATION, BUT THEN WE DO NOT DIRECTLY ASSIGN THESE ITEMS TO THE BIDDERS BECAUSE THIS IS ONLY OPTIMAL WITH RESPECT TO THIS APPROXIMATIONS AND NOT OPTIMAL
utt_0056 utt 369.53 383.13 -X WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUTH BUT WE CAN ASK EACH BIDDER TO REPORT THEIR VALUE FOR THIS SPECIFIC BUNDLE WHERE WE THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THEM, BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR VALUE FUNCTION
utt_0058 utt 383.13 388.79 -X FOR EVERY POSSIBLE BUNDLE BUT ONLY FOR THOSE BUNDLES WHERE WE THINK THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM.
utt_0059 utt 388.79 402.68 -X AND NOW THE NICE THING IS YOU CAN ITERATE THIS SO NOW WE HAVE ONE MORE TRAINING DATA POINT FOR EACH NEURAL NETWORK SO WE CAN RETRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK FOR EACH BIDDER BASED ON ALL THE INFORMATION WE
utt_0061 utt 402.68 408.41 -X HAVE COLLECTED SO FAR AND THEN KEEP ITERATING UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE FINAL QUERY BUDGET.
utt_0062 utt 409.40 416.03 -X BUT YEAH NOW YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT HAVE WE GAINED COMPARED TO STANDARD VCG
utt_0063 utt 417.30 424.43 -X BECAUSE THIS WINNER DETERMINATION PROBLEM MIGHT ALSO BE NP-HARD BUT THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS THAT
utt_0064 utt 424.43 433.55 -X WE ASK EACH BIDDER ONLY one hundred QUERIES AND EACH OF THESE QUERIES IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN BILLIONS
utt_0065 utt 433.55 442.94 -X OF COMPUTATIONS SO HERE WE FORMULATED THIS WINNER DETERMINATION PROBLEM AS A MIXED INTEGER LINEAR
utt_0066 utt 442.94 451.84 -X PROGRAM WHICH CAN BE SOLVED SUFFICIENTLY GOOD IN PRACTICE SO THIS NP-HARDNESS IS NOT REALLY
utt_0067 utt 452.22 459.87 -X A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE CAN AFFORD A FEW BILLIONS OF COMPUTATIONS AND GET SUFFICIENTLY PRECISE RESULTS.
utt_0068 utt 461.30 467.74 -X BUT WHAT CAN WE STILL IMPROVE IN THIS MECHANISM? ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS MECHANISM IS
utt_0069 utt 470.94 482.43 -X THAT IT CAN GET STUCK: IT CAN HAPPEN THAT WE ASK THE SAME BIDDER ALMOST THE SAME QUESTION MULTIPLE TIMES FROM WHICH WE DO NOT GET THAT MUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
utt_0071 utt 483.26 490.30 -X IT WOULD BE BETTER TO ASK A SET OF MORE DIVERSE QUESTIONS WHERE WE GET NEW INFORMATION FOR EACH
utt_0072 utt 490.90 499.92 -X QUESTION AND SO WE WANT TO DO THIS BY MAKING THE METHOD CURIOUS TO EXPLORE ALSO THE VALUE OF THOSE
utt_0073 utt 499.92 509.20 -X BUNDLES WHERE WE THINK THIS APPROXIMATION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH YET. SO TO GET CURIOSITY WE NEED TO
utt_0074 utt 509.20 515.64 -X HAVE SOME MEASURE OF UNCERTAINTY TO SAY WHERE WE THINK OUR APPROXIMATION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH YET.
utt_0075 utt 518.14 531.82 -X TO DESCRIBE THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS VALUE FUNCTION WE NEED TO HAVE IN MIND THAT THIS VALUE FUNCTION IS A HIGH DIMENSIONAL OBJECT WITH M-DIMENSIONAL INPUT IF YOU HAVE M ITEMS WHICH IS NOT EASY TO
utt_0077 utt 531.87 544.67 -X VISUALIZE TO EXPLAIN YOU HOW WE CALCULATE THIS UNCERTAINTY, SO I EXPLAIN UNCERTAINTY TO YOU BASED ON A SIMPLE ONE-DIMENSIONAL EXAMPLE WHERE WE HAVE ONE DIMENSIONAL INPUT INSTEAD
utt_0079 utt 544.67 553.12 -X OF M-DIMENSIONAL INPUT. IMAGINE THAT FOR FIVE INPUT POINTS WE KNOW THE VALUES AND FOR THE OTHER
utt_0080 utt 553.63 566.59 -X INPUTS WE DON'T KNOW THE VALUE. WHAT YOU CAN DO IS THAT WE JUST FIT A NEURAL NETWORK THROUGH THIS DATA POINTS WHICH GIVES US SOME PREDICTION FOR EVERY POSSIBLE INPUT. AND WE CAN USE THE PRIOR
utt_0082 utt 566.59 577.12 -X KNOWLEDGE IN MANY SPECTRUM OPTIONS WE HAVE THE FREE DISPOSAL PROPERTY WHICH GUARANTEES US THAT THIS VALUE FUNCTION IS MONOTONICALLY INCREASING AND ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THE VALUE OF ZERO
utt_0084 utt 577.12 584.99 -X IS ZERO. AND NOW IF WE ALSO WANT TO INCORPORATE UNCERTAINTY, WE DEVELOPED A METHOD WHICH COMPUTES
utt_0085 utt 585.31 592.93 -X A PLAUSIBLE UPPER BOUND WHICH FULFILLS THAT THE TRUTH MOST OF THE TIME IS BELOW
utt_0086 utt 594.27 602.27 -X THIS GREEN FUNCTION WITHOUT BEING TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE TRUTH. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO
utt_0087 utt 603.58 614.30 -X CALCULATE THE one hundred% UPPER BOUND WHERE WE HAVE A MATHEMATICAL GUARANTEE BECAUSE OF MONOTONICITY
utt_0088 utt 614.30 627.52 -X THAT IT'S ALWAYS ABOVE THE TRUTH BUT MOST OF THE TIME THIS WOULD BE QUITE FAR AWAY FROM THE TRUTH WHICH DOES NOT MAKE IT SO USEFUL FOR PRACTICE WHILE THE GREEN CURVE IS USUALLY STILL CLOSE TO
utt_0090 utt 627.52 640.78 -X THE TRUTH AND STILL MOST OF THE TIME, MAYBE NOT ALWAYS, BUT MOST OF THE TIME ABOVE THE TRUTH SO THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK WAS ACTUALLY TO DEVELOP THIS METHOD TO OBTAIN THE GREEN
utt_0092 utt 641.63 654.94 -X FUNCTION WHICH FULFILLS CERTAIN PROPERTIES BUT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THERE IN DETAIL. INSTEAD I RATHER EXPLAIN YOU HOW WE USE THIS PLAUSIBLE UPPER BOUND IN GREEN TO MAKE OUR METHOD CURIOUS.
utt_0094 utt 657.15 671.84 -X SO IN OUR PREVIOUS NEURAL NETWORK WE USED A NEURAL NETWORK SOMETHING LIKE THIS BLUE CURVE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE TRUE VALUE FUNCTION IN THIS WINNER DETERMINATION PROBLEM AND NOW WE SIMPLY
utt_0096 utt 671.84 681.76 -X REPLACE THE BLUE FUNCTION BY THE GREEN FUNCTION TO USE OUR UPPER BOUND. WHY DOES THIS INCORPORATE
utt_0097 utt 681.92 690.16 -X CURIOSITY? IT'S BECAUSE AT THE TRAINING DATA POINTS, THAT WE HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED DURING
utt_0098 utt 691.26 699.04 -X DURING TRAINING, THE GREEN AND THE BLUE CURVE COINCIDE, BECAUSE THERE'S NO UNCERTAINTY LEFT.
utt_0099 utt 699.04 710.63 -X WE KNOW ALREADY WHAT'S THE VALUE FOR THOSE BUNDLES. ONLY FOR THE BUNDLES THAT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE OBSERVED IN TRAINING, FOR THE VERY DIFFERENT BUNDLES THE GREEN CURVE
utt_0101 utt 710.63 723.68 -X HAS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE BLUE CURVE TO ALSO CAPTURE THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AND BECAUSE THE WINNER DETERMINATION PROBLEM IS A MAXIMIZATION PROBLEM
utt_0103 utt 724.25 734.24 -X THIS ADDITIONAL HEIGHT OF THE GREEN FUNCTION IS AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO EXPLORE THIS
utt_0104 utt 734.24 749.12 -X UNSEEN BUNDLES. THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS ALSO USED IN BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION. THIS IS WHY WE CALL OUR METHOD BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION BASED COMBINATORIAL ASSIGNMENT, WHERE EXPLORATION IS ALSO PROMOTED BY
utt_0106 utt 749.12 763.04 -X UPPER BOUND. THIS IS CALLED UCB ALGORITHMS WHERE UCP STANDS FOR UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUNDS OR UPPER CREDIBLE BOUNDS. BUT LET'S GET TO THE LAST SLIDE WHERE WE DISCUSS OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS IN THE
utt_0108 utt 763.04 768.64 -X CASE OF SPECTRUM AUCTIONS. THERE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT SIMULATORS TO EVALUATE OUR RESULTS.
utt_0109 utt 769.15 779.78 -X JAKOB AND SVEN WERE THE FIRST TO USE NEURAL NETWORKS IN THIS CONTEXT AND THEY DIRECTLY ACHIEVED STATE-OF-THE-ART RESULTS WITH THEIR METHOD. THEN THIS SUMMER WE PUBLISHED A PAPER
utt_0111 utt 779.78 792.64 -X WHERE WE USE THE ADDITIONAL PRIOR KNOWLEDGE THAT THE TRUE VALUE FUNCTION IS MONOTONICALLY INCREASING AND WITH THIS WE CAN OUTPERFORM ALL PREVIOUS BENCHMARKS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY.
utt_0113 utt 792.64 800.55 -X AND THEN IN TODAY'S PAPER WE AGAIN ON AVERAGE PERFORM BETTER THAN ALL PREVIOUS BENCHMARKS AND
