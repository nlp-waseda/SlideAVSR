utt_0000 utt 4.91 12.62 -X HI THIS IS THE TALK ON THE LOW/HIGH INDEX OF PUPILLARY ACTIVITY FOR CHI two thousand and twenty.
utt_0002 utt 12.62 17.84 -X IT'S WORK BY MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS KRZYSZTOF KREJTZ, NINA GEHRER
utt_0004 utt 18.03 21.81 -X TANYA BAFNA, PER BAEKGAARD. KRZYSZTOF IS IN
utt_0005 utt 22.13 36.08 -X POLAND, NINA IS IN GERMANY, TANYA AND PER ARE IN DENMARK. WE HAVE FUNDING FROM THE US NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION FOR MY PART, BEVICA FONDEN FOR DENMARK AND POLSKIE MINISTERSTWO NAUKI I
utt_0010 utt 36.08 39.31 -X SZKOLNICTWA WYÅ»SZEGO IN POLAND.
utt_0011 utt 39.50 43.89 -X ALRIGHT SO THE PAPER IS ON AN EYE TRACKING MEASUREMENT OF COGNITIVE LOAD
utt_0013 utt 44.49 58.00 -X USING THE WAVELET TRANSFORM AND LOOKING AT THE TRANSIENT AND PHASIC...THE PHASIC AND TONIC SIGNALS OF THE PUPIL DIAMETER OSCILLATION. SO HERE WE'VE GOT SOME
utt_0017 utt 58.00 61.89 -X APPLICATIONS WHERE THIS COULD BE USED AUTOMOTIVE LEARNING DOMAINS: IT'S A PAPER
utt_0019 utt 62.10 65.97 -X two thousand and sixteen AT CHI ALSO PEYSAKHOVICH DID A
utt_0020 utt 66.16 79.41 -X PHD DISSERTATION USING THE LOW FREQUENCY HIGH FREQUENCY RATIO OF PUPIL DIAMETER IN HIS STUDY AND SOME OF OUR ALGORITHMIC DEVELOPMENTS BASED ON THAT WORK THAT WAS
utt_0024 utt 79.41 85.68 -X IN TOULOUSE, FRANCE IN two thousand and sixteen, AND ALSO ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS FRIDMAN ET AL two thousand and eighteen
utt_0026 utt 85.81 92.56 -X ALSO A CHI PAPER OF COGNITIVE LOAD DURING DRIVING, AMONG OTHER EXAMPLES WHICH YOU CAN LOOK IN THE PAPER FOR MORE.
utt_0029 utt 93.65 98.77 -X I WILL SKIP MOST OF THIS JUST TO MENTION THE COGNITIVE LOAD THEORY
utt_0031 utt 99.22 108.63 -X ORIGINATED BY SWELLER IN one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-eight WHICH HIGHLIGHTED THE USE AND RELIANCE ON SHORT-TERM MEMORY AND WHICH IS WHY OFTEN
utt_0034 utt 108.63 114.74 -X TIMES COGNITIVE LOAD IS MEASURED USING
utt_0035 utt 114.93 120.28 -X TASK DIFFICULTY, TASKS THAT USE SOME ASPECT OF MEMORY SUCH AS N-BACK
utt_0037 utt 121.94 135.74 -X OFTENTIMES EYE TRACKING PAPERS ALSO MENTION HESS AND POLT one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-four REFERRING BACK TO THAT WORK ON PUPIL DIAMETER, HOWEVER, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT IN THAT WORK THEY USED A SPECIALIZED PUPILLOMETER,
utt_0043 utt 135.89 146.30 -X AN ARRIFLEX sixteen-MILLIMETER WHICH MEASURED AT TWO FRAMES PER SECOND WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM TODAY'S EYE TRACKERS WHICH MEASURE AT A HIGHER RATE AND ARE USUALLY MUCH FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PUPIL
utt_0048 utt 146.74 149.21 -X AND THE EYE IS USUALLY ALLOWED TO MOVE.
utt_0049 utt 151.12 152.98 -X THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING CALLED THE TASK-
utt_0050 utt 152.98 164.89 -X EVOKED PUPILLARY DILATION OR PUPILLARY RESPONSE, TEPR, THAT IS OFTEN MENTIONED AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE AS PER THE GRAPH IN THE ORIGINAL PAPER THAT PUPIL DIAMETER IS OFTEN MEASURED IN RELATION TO A BASELINE
utt_0056 utt 165.01 167.62 -X MEASUREMENT. SO USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS
utt_0057 utt 167.92 178.07 -X THERE'S A TASK WHERE THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING AND THAT'S THE BASELINE, AND THEN A TASK OF INCREASED DIFFICULTY IS GIVEN, PUPIL DIAMETER IS MEASURED THERE,
utt_0061 utt 178.07 191.90 -X AVERAGED, AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE IS TAKEN BETWEEN THAT MEASUREMENT AND THE AVERAGE DURING BASELINE. PEYSAKHOVICH IN HIS STUDY LINKED PUPIL DIAMETER TO THE LC-NE SYSTEM WHERE HE BASICALLY SAID
utt_0066 utt 191.90 197.15 -X THAT THE PUPIL DIAMETER IN RESPONSE TO TASK DIFFICULTY IS THE PHASIC RESPONSE
utt_0068 utt 197.43 210.56 -X WHEREAS THE BASELINE MEASUREMENT IS LINKED TO THE TONIC RESPONSE, AND ONE THING HE ALSO MENTIONED IS THAT WHAT IF YOU TAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF THE PUPIL
utt_0072 utt 210.68 220.60 -X UNDER LOW-LIGHT CONDITIONS? WELL IN THAT CASE THE PUPIL DIAMETER IS ALREADY DILATED AND THERE'S A DANGER THERE OF MISSING THE RESPONSE TO COGNITIVE LOAD
utt_0076 utt 220.89 225.88 -X WITH PUPIL DILATION AS THE EXPECTED RESPONSE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT
utt_0078 utt 226.55 228.12 -X FOR FUTURE STUDIES.
utt_0079 utt 229.78 244.17 -X SO PEYSAKHOVICH DID A BASIC STUDY ON A TOULOUSE N-BACK TASK I WON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE TIME CONSTRAINTS FOR THIS TALK, THE POINT BEING THOUGH IS THAT HIS RATIO SHOWED AN
utt_0084 utt 244.17 246.40 -X INVERSE RELATIONSHIP TO COGNITIVE LOAD,
utt_0085 utt 246.40 248.48 -X IN OTHER WORDS, THE LF/HF RATIO WHICH
utt_0086 utt 248.51 251.58 -X SHOULD BE LOWER WITH AN INCREASED LOAD.
utt_0087 utt 251.58 257.68 -X THA'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER FOR LATER, AND HIS RESPONSE SHOWED DISTINCTION
utt_0089 utt 259.03 273.97 -X BETWEEN TASK DIFFICULTY. ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT HIS TASK THOUGH IS, THAT, IT WAS TAKEN...THE SIGNAL WAS TAKEN OVER THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE OF THE MEASUREMENT WHEREAS WHAT WE DO AND THE
utt_0094 utt 273.97 286.86 -X PUPIL DIAMETER AND THE WAVELET TRANSFORM CAN BE MEASURED POTENTIALLY IN MUCH SHORTER INCREMENTS PERHAPS EVEN IN REAL-TIME. ALRIGHT SO A LOT OF OUR WORK IS BASED ON OUR two thousand and eighteen
utt_0099 utt 287.16 300.61 -X PAPER AT CHI WHERE WE INTRODUCE THE IPA WHICH WAS THE INDEX OF PUPILLARY ACTIVITY BASED ON SANDRA MARSHALL'S INDEX OF COGNITIVE ACTIVITY, SOMETHING THAT SHE PATENTED BUT IN HER VERSION OF THE ICA
utt_0104 utt 300.61 303.33 -X THERE IS ONLY THE WAVELET COEFFICIENT
utt_0105 utt 304.48 308.74 -X DECOMPOSITION MENTIONED AND SHE DOES NOT MENTION THE SCALING FUNCTION AND,
utt_0107 utt 308.74 318.50 -X BECAUSE IT IS PATENDTED, DETAILS OF HER IMPLEMENTATION ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND OUTSIDE OF THE PATENT ITSELF. SO IN two thousand and eighteen WE
utt_0110 utt 319.68 323.10 -X DISCUSSED HOW THAT WORKS AND WE PRESENTED OUR OWN VERSION OF THE ICA
utt_0112 utt 323.20 336.39 -X CALLED THE IPA AND SO HERE SIMILAR TO SANDRA MARSHALL'S, WE HAVE THE WAVELET DECOMPOSITION, THE PSI FUNCTION, BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT OF THE SCALING FUNCTION AND BOTH OF THEM ARE USED IN COMBINATION TO
utt_0117 utt 336.39 349.94 -X GIVE YOU THE WAVELET TRANSFORM WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS A MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSIS OF THE SIGNAL. THE J SUPERSCRIPT THERE INDICATES WHICH LEVEL OF DECOMPOSITION YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR THE
utt_0122 utt 350.37 358.56 -X CHANGES IN THE SIGNAL. SO HERE IS THE DISCRETE VERSION AND HERE IS THE WAVELET
utt_0124 utt 359.01 371.97 -X FILTERING ESSENTIALLY G THERE IS THE CONVOLUTION OF THE FILTER YOU SEE IN THE TABLE AT LEFT IF WE LOOK DOWN ACROSS THE COEFFICIENTS TO SEE ONE AND MINUS ONE AND SO IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE PAIRS OF NUMBERS
utt_0131 utt 372.19 385.70 -X MEANWHILE THE SCALING FUNCTION USES THE H FILTER WHICH IS AN AVERAGING FILTER YOU SEE THE COEFFICIENTS THERE ONE AND ONE DIVIDED BY ROOT TWO BOTH OF THEM SO YOU HAVE A SUM, IT'S A SUM OF PRODUCTS SO
utt_0136 utt 385.70 398.50 -X YOU TAKE THE FIRST VALUE IS MULTIPLIED BY ONE OVER ROOT TWO TO THE SECOND VALUE IS ONE OVER ROOT TWO, ADD THEM TOGETHER AND DIVIDE AND YOU GET AN AVERAGE SIGNAL. OTHER FILTERS CAN BE USED OF COURSE, DAUBECHIESminus four IS A POPULAR ONE WE ENDED UP USING THE
utt_0142 utt 398.50 403.94 -X SYMLETminus sixteen WAVELET---THE LONGER THE FILTER IS THE SMOOTHER THE EFFECT IS OF
utt_0144 utt 404.00 418.21 -X THE SCALING FUNCTION. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHAT YOU GET IN twoD AND SO YOU HAVE THOSE SAME FILTERS BUT APPLIED OVER THE ROWS IN WHICH CASE YOU GET A DIFFERENCE AND YOU GET THE VERTICAL EDGES AS YOU SEE IN QUADRANT TWO IN THE IMAGE AT RIGHT OR IF
utt_0150 utt 418.21 432.68 -X YOU TAKE THE FILTERS AND APPLY THEM PER COLUMN YOU WILL GET HORIZONTAL EDGES AS YOU SEE IN QUADRANT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE ONE TWO THREE THIRD QUADRANT BOTTOM LEFT. MEANWHILE THE SCALING FUNCTION GIVES YOU A SUBSAMPLED VERSION OF THE SIGNAL WHICH IS AT THE UPPER LEFT
utt_0157 utt 432.68 445.22 -X QUADRANT THREE AND IF YOU NOW TAKE THE NEXT LEVEL OF THE RESOLUTION THEN WE HAVE THE NEXT LEVEL COEFFICIENTS AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS HIGH FREQUENCY CONTENT AT THE ORIGINAL
utt_0162 utt 445.22 455.14 -X BASE OF THE PYRAMID AND THEN WE GET LOWER FREQUENCY EDGES AS WE GO UP THE PYRAMID IN THE DECOMPOSITION. IN oneD THE
utt_0165 utt 455.91 462.34 -X IDEA IS SIMILAR EXCEPT OF COURSE IT APPLIES TO THE oneD SIGNAL WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE PUPIL DIAMETER IS, IT'S JUST A LINE.
utt_0168 utt 463.24 477.35 -X SO IN PRACTICE WE USE A SYMLETminus sixteen WAVELET TO GET A SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER SIGNAL AND WHAT WE DID BEYOND SANDRA MARSHALL'S ICA IS LOOK AT THE EDGES OR THE CHANGES IN MOMENT-TO-MOMENT OSCILLATION OF PUPIL DIAMETER, AND THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED BY LOOKING AT THE
utt_0175 utt 477.35 487.69 -X NEIGHBORS TO THE PARTICULAR VALUE THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN AND IF THOSE NEIGHBORS ARE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL OR SORRY THE CENTRAL VALUE IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE NEIGHBORS AND
utt_0180 utt 487.78 491.27 -X IT IS STRICTLY GREATER THAN ONE OF THEM THEN WE HAVE AN EDGE IN THE SIGNAL.
utt_0182 utt 491.27 493.32 -X THAT'S WHAT WE FIND TO THRESHOLD THE
utt_0183 utt 493.70 497.00 -X MOMENT-TO-MOMENT OSCILLATION OF PUPIL DIAMETER.
utt_0184 utt 497.00 511.56 -X THE two thousand and eighteen PAPER HAD THE CODE FOR THIS WHICH IS STILL READILY AVAILABLE OF COURSE IN two thousand and twenty WE UPDATED THAT WITH THE LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH FREQUENCY RATIO AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS IS JUST TAKING
utt_0189 utt 512.07 524.12 -X THE LOW FREQUENCY COMPONENT, DIVIDING IT BY THE HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENT SO THE HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID AND YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE IN THE MIDDLE AS THE LOW FREQUENCY COMPONENT AND THEN OBTAIN THE LF/HF
utt_0195 utt 524.17 526.96 -X RATIO FROM WITHIN THE WAVELET
utt_0196 utt 527.18 540.14 -X DECOMPOSITION WHICH IS I THINK NEW I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY ELSE DO THIS. AS I SAID PEYSAKHOVICH DID THIS OVER THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THE SIGNAL HERE WE'RE DOING IT WITHIN THE WAVELET DOMAIN. THAT'S OUR KEY TECHNICAL INNOVATION OF THE PAPER.
utt_0202 utt 540.14 553.56 -X ALRIGHT, TO VALIDATE WE APPLIED THE LHIPA AS IT'S CALLED, THE LHIPA TO THE SAME STUDY THAT WE DID IN two thousand and eighteen WHICH IS A REPLICATION OF SIEGENTHALER ET AL. AND
utt_0206 utt 553.56 557.52 -X THERE WAS NUMBER COUNTING, SO YOU EITHER COUNT BACKWARD BY seventeen---THE DIFFICULT TASKS---
utt_0208 utt 557.52 559.69 -X OR COUNT FORWARD BY two---THE EASY TASK.
utt_0209 utt 561.29 566.00 -X YOU CAN SEE THE PAPER FOR THE RESULTS THAT WE OBTAINED TWO YEARS AGO,
utt_0211 utt 566.35 579.97 -X THE STUDY WAS SHOWN TO BE INDEED INDICATIVE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK SO ACCURACY OF RESPONSES WERE LOWER AT HIGH DIFFICULTY AND IT WAS ALSO SUBJECTIVELY FOUND TO BE ANNOYING. YOU CAN
utt_0216 utt 579.97 581.65 -X REFER TO THAT PAPER TO GET MORE DETAILS.
utt_0217 utt 582.09 589.55 -X SO THE IPA THEN AND NOW RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK.
utt_0219 utt 590.19 600.02 -X HERE THE LHIPA AS EXPECTED IS SHOWING THE INVERSE RELATIONSHIP SO THE GREATER THE DIFFICULTY THE LOWER THE LHIPA VALUE.
utt_0222 utt 600.30 614.29 -X AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN NEITHER CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EASY AND CONTROL TASKS, HOWEVER, THAT'S NOT THAT NECESSARILY A BAD RESULT BECAUSE IN A SENSE NOT MUCH IS HAPPENING COGNITIVELY IN THE EASY TASK AND SO THE
utt_0228 utt 614.29 623.70 -X DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO AND THE CONTROL WERE NOTHING'S HAPPENING IS NOT SO, IS NOT SO DIRE. ALRIGHT SO REALLY THE INNOVATIONS BEYOND THE
utt_0233 utt 625.17 626.67 -X TWO ADDITIONAL TASKS. IN two thousand and eighteen
utt_0234 utt 626.76 638.42 -X SOMEBODY IN THE AUDIENCE SAID WELL DID YOU USE N-BACK? I SAID NO BECAUSE WE HAD TO REPLICATE SEIGENTHALER ET AL., SO HERE FOR two thousand and twenty WE DID DO AN N-BACK TASK FOLLOWING THE APPEL ET AL. PAPER AT ETRA two thousand and eighteen.
utt_0240 utt 638.93 653.11 -X IT'S A TUEBINGEN GROUP WHICH DID A one-BACK AND two-BACK OR AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT WE ASKED THEM HOW THEY DID THEIRS AND WE ASKED FOR THEIR GUIDANCE IN HOW DO WE DO THE THE N-BACK TASK HERE. AND SO WE TRIED
utt_0245 utt 653.11 667.19 -X THE four-BACK TASK IN A PILOT STUDY BUT FOUND THAT REMEMBERING BACK FOUR STEPS BACK ACTUALLY LED TO PARTICIPANTS GUESSING IN THE PILOT STUDY AND SO WE GOT RESULTS THAT WERE NO DIFFERENT FROM RANDOM. SO WE ENDED UP WITH one-BACK AS
utt_0251 utt 667.19 672.32 -X THE EASY TASK WHICH YOU JUST REMEMBER THE LETTER BEFORE, AND two-BACK YOU REMEMBER TWO LETTERS BEFORE, SO THIS
utt_0254 utt 673.07 679.09 -X WAS NINA'S CONTRIBUTION TO DESIGN AN EXPERIMENT FOLLOWING AT THE APPEL GROUP.
utt_0256 utt 679.12 687.96 -X WE USED A LIMITED ALPHABET C, F, H, I THINK AND MAYBE S YOU'RE REFERRED BACK TO THE PAPER TO SEE HOW WE DESIGNED THIS TASK. AGAIN, IT'S A REPLICATION OF
utt_0260 utt 688.53 702.39 -X APPEL ET AL.'S ETRA PAPER. ONE PROBLEM WE HAD IN THIS SETUP IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY I USE LOW LIGHTING CONDITION AND I GUESS I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT PEYSAKHOVICH'S WARNING THAT IF
utt_0265 utt 702.39 705.59 -X YOU HAVE THE PUPIL ALREADY DILATED IT MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS IN FINDING PUPIL
utt_0267 utt 706.03 715.38 -X DIFFERENCE RELATED TO THAT DIFFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL BASELINE IF YOU HAVE LOW LIGHTING CONDITION. NEVERTHELESS WE DID DO THE one-BACK AND two-BACK TASKS HERE,
utt_0271 utt 715.38 728.92 -X COUNTERBALANCED, AND LHIPA SHOWED, AS EXPECTED, A GOOD RESPONSE WHEREAS THE TASK WAS DISTINGUISHED FROM BASELINE. THE IPA, ON THE OTHER HAND, RESPONDED CONTRARY
utt_0275 utt 728.92 734.42 -X TO EXPECTATIONS. IN FACT IT DECREASED WITH TASK DIFFICULTY WHICH IS NOT GOOD.
utt_0277 utt 734.42 743.69 -X WELL ANOTHER THING THAT I WE DID HERE WAS WE VARIED THE GAZE POINT TO FIVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ON THE SCREEN TO CONTROL FOR THAT WHEREAS THE ORIGINAL
utt_0281 utt 744.63 751.93 -X IPA IN two thousand and eighteen USED A FIXED GAZE TASK WHEN PEOPLE LOOKED ONLY IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN. SO HERE WE'RE CONTROLLING FOR THE APPARENT...
utt_0285 utt 753.36 764.12 -X THE APPERANCE OF THE PUPIL OFF AXIS WHICH WILL BE AN ELLIPSE WHEN IT'S OFF AXIS TO THE CAMERA IN THE EYE TRACKER. AND THAT HAD NO EFFECT SO THAT'S A GOOD THING.
utt_0289 utt 764.12 778.17 -X HERE IN EXPERIMENT THREE WAS OUR APPLIED SETTING WHERE PEOPLE WERE PERFORMING AN EYE-TYPING TASK. AGAIN, TWO DIFFICULTY LEVELS MEASURED BY THE LIX READABILITY SCORE THEY HAD TO REMEMBER A PHRASE AND THEN TYPE IT BACK IN AN EYE TYPING KIND
utt_0295 utt 778.17 781.74 -X OF APPLICATION, THATS' SHOWN HERE. IF THE LIX WAS LESS THAN thirty THEN IT
utt_0297 utt 781.94 794.71 -X WAS THE EASY TASK, GREATER THAN sixty IT WAS THE DIFFICULT TASK. HERE YOU CAN SEE THE LETTER T HIGHLIGHTED IN RED WHICH IS WHAT THE USER IS FIXATING TO TYPE THE LETTER T. AND IN THIS CASE ONCE AGAIN
utt_0302 utt 794.71 800.35 -X LHIPA SHOWED RESULTS THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS,
utt_0304 utt 800.35 805.75 -X IN OTHER WORDS LHIPA IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO TASK DIFFICULTY WHICH IS A GOOD THING.
utt_0307 utt 805.75 819.93 -X IPA ONCE AGAIN GAVE US RESULTS CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS. ONE THING TO NOTE HERE, EYE GAZE IS FREE TO MOVE AS THE PERSON IS TYPING AND SO THIS IS A VERY GOOD ROBUST RESULT OF THE LHIPA IN THIS
utt_0312 utt 819.93 834.17 -X PARTICULAR EXAMPLE. SO THAT'S IT WE'VE GOT THREE EXPERIMENTS SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD ROBUST RESULTS FOR LHIPA. THE IPA, ON THE OTHER HAND, ONLY USED ONE WAVELET COEFFICIENT BAND IT DID NOT
utt_0317 utt 834.17 848.19 -X TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TONIC/PHASIC RELATION, UH, RATIO AS THE LHIPA DOES AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY LHIPA IS RESPONDING BETTER IN THESE THREE TASKS WHEREAS THE IPA ONLY RESPONDED WELL IN
utt_0322 utt 848.19 853.02 -X THE ORIGINAL FIXED GAZE TASK. SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS PRETTY GOOD POTENTIAL FOR
utt_0324 utt 853.46 858.20 -X BEING A ROBUST MEASURE OF COGNITIVE LOAD AS WELL AS FOR POTENTIAL REAL-TIME USE.
utt_0326 utt 858.20 871.17 -X THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BECAUSE IT'S A LIMITED KIND OF OR VIRTUAL CONFERENCE I SUPPOSE THE BEST WAY I CAN ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS MIGHT BE THROUGH EMAIL AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO DO SO I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THE CODE IN PYTHON IF
utt_0332 utt 871.17 881.63 -X YOU LIKE AS WELL I'M EAGER TO SEE HOW LHIPA WOULD, HOW IT WOULD WORK IN YOUR EXPERIMENTS SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING IN TOUCH, THANK YOU
utt_0337 utt 881.63 894.81 -1.4335 VERY MUCH.
