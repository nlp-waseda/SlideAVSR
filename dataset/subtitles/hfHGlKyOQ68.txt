utt_0001 utt 0.59 4.78 -X THIS IS REN HUAN FROM USTC PRESENTING OUR WORK P-MIL.
utt_0002 utt 5.87 9.26 -X FIRSTLY, WE PROVIDE A QUICK PREVIEW OF OUR WORK.
utt_0003 utt 9.45 23.19 -X MOST EXISTING WEAKLY-SUPERVISED TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION METHODS ADOPT THE SEGMENT-BASED MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK (S-MIL), WHERE THE PREDICTIONS OF SEGMENTS ARE SUPERVISED BY THE LABELS OF VIDEOS.
utt_0006 utt 23.60 29.81 -X NOTE THAT IN THIS PAPER, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSAL REFERS TO A SET OF TEMPORALLY CONTIGUOUS SEGMENTS.
utt_0007 utt 30.48 34.71 -X AS SHOWN IN THE LEFT FIGURE, DURING TESTING, WE NEED TO SCORE THE PROPOSALS.
utt_0008 utt 34.74 44.60 -X HOWEVER, S-MIL FRAMEWORK SCORES THE SEGMENTS DURING TRAINING, WHICH RESULTS IN INCONSISTENT SCORING OBJECTIVES AND MAY LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL RESULTS.
utt_0010 utt 45.04 51.92 -X THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL PROPOSAL-BASED MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK (P-MIL)
utt_0011 utt 51.92 58.01 -X AS SHOWN IN THE RIGHT FIGURE, WHICH DIRECTLY CLASSIFIES CANDIDATE PROPOSALS DURING BOTH
utt_0013 utt 61.78 65.46 -X NEXT, WE WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED INTRODUCTION TO OUR WORK.
utt_0014 utt 66.23 75.13 -X GIVEN AN INPUT VIDEO, THE TASK OF TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION AIMS TO LOCATE AND RECOGNIZE ACTIONS IN THE VIDEO.
utt_0016 utt 75.13 88.12 -X UNDER THE FULLY-SUPERVISED SETTING, IT REQUIRES THE START AND END TIME POINTS OF THE ACTIONS DURING TRAINING, WHICH IS A CUMBERSOME ANNOTATION PROCESS THAT LIMITS ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION.
utt_0018 utt 88.69 100.41 -X COMPARED TO FULLY-SUPERVISED SETTING, UNDER THE WEAKLY-SUPERVISED SETTING, TRAINING ONLY REQUIRES THE CATEGORY LABEL OF THE VIDEO, WHICH IS EASIER TO ANNOTATE.
utt_0020 utt 102.07 112.41 -X MOST EXISTING WEAKLY-SUPERVISED TEMPORAL ACTION LOCALIZATION METHODS ADOPT THE SEGMENT-BASED MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK (S-MIL).
utt_0022 utt 112.41 125.88 -X SPECIFICALLY, THE VIDEO-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION SCORES CAN BE DERIVED BY AGGREGATING THE CLASS ACTIVATION SEQUENCE (CAS) WITH THE ATTENTION SEQUENCE, WHICH ARE THEN SUPERVISED BY THE VIDEO-LEVEL CATEGORY LABEL.
utt_0025 utt 126.74 139.26 -X DURING TESTING, CANDIDATE PROPOSALS ARE GENERATED BY THRESHOLDING THE ATTENTION SEQUENCE, AND THEN THE CORRESPONDING SEGMENT-LEVEL CAS IS AGGREGATED TO SCORE EACH PROPOSAL.
utt_0027 utt 139.26 142.33 -X HOWEVER, THIS FRAMEWORK HAS TWO MAIN DRAWBACKS.
utt_0028 utt 142.71 149.28 -X FIRSTLY, THERE IS A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE SCORING OBJECTIVES OF THE TRAINING AND TESTING STAGES.
utt_0030 utt 150.23 156.54 -X DURING TESTING, CANDIDATE PROPOSALS NEED TO BE SCORED AS A WHOLE, WHILE DURING TRAINING,
utt_0031 utt 156.54 159.42 -X THE CLASSIFIER IS TRAINED TO SCORE SEGMENTS.
utt_0032 utt 159.77 166.11 -X THIS INCONSISTENT SCORING METHOD MAY LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL RESULTS.
utt_0033 utt 166.11 170.85 -X SECONDLY, IT IS DIFFICULT TO CLASSIFY SEGMENTS ALONE IN MANY CASES.
utt_0034 utt 171.32 183.79 -X AS SHOWN IN THE RED BOX IN THE RIGHT FIGURE, BY WATCHING A SINGLE RUNNING SEGMENT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH WHETHER IT BELONGS TO HIGH JUMP, LONG JUMP, OR TRIPLE-JUMP, ONLY
utt_0036 utt 183.79 191.68 -X AFTER OBSERVING THE ENTIRE ACTION AND COMBINING IT WITH CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION CAN THE CATEGORY BE DETERMINED.
utt_0038 utt 192.89 202.95 -X IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL PROPOSAL-BASED MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK (P-MIL), AS SHOWN IN FIGURE (A).
utt_0040 utt 203.29 206.91 -X THE OVERALL TRAINING PROCESS IS DIVIDED INTO TWO STAGES.
utt_0041 utt 207.45 216.36 -X IN THE FIRST STAGE, AN S-MIL BASELINE MODEL IS TRAINED AND THE CANDIDATE PROPOSALS ARE GENERATED BY THRESHOLDING THE ATTENTION SEQUENCE.
utt_0043 utt 216.80 222.76 -X THEN PROPOSAL FEATURES CAN BE EXTRACTED WITH THE SURROUNDING CONTRASTIVE FEATURE EXTRACTION MODULE.
utt_0045 utt 223.39 235.59 -X IN THE SECOND STAGE, THE CANDIDATE PROPOSALS ARE CLASSIFIED AND AGGREGATED INTO VIDEO-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION SCORES, WHICH ARE SUPERVISED BY THE VIDEO-LEVEL CLASS LABELS.
utt_0047 utt 236.58 249.38 -X SINCE THE PROPOSALS ARE DIRECTLY CLASSIFIED IN BOTH TRAINING AND TESTING STAGES, THE PROPOSED P-MIL FRAMEWORK CAN EFFECTIVELY SOLVE THE DRAWBACKS OF THE S-MIL FRAMEWORK.
utt_0049 utt 249.70 255.08 -X HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL SOME ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WITHIN THE P-MIL FRAMEWORK.
utt_0050 utt 255.39 262.86 -X THEREFORE, WE FURTHER PROPOSE THREE KEY DESIGNS, AS SHOWN IN THE SUB-FIGURES BELOW.
utt_0051 utt 262.86 270.09 -X FIRSTLY, WE PROPOSE AN SURROUNDING CONTRASTIVE FEATURE EXTRACTION MODULE (SCFE), AS SHOWN
utt_0052 utt 270.09 282.06 -X IN FIGURE (B), WHICH EXTENDS THE LEFT AND RIGHT BOUNDARIES OF THE PROPOSALS, AND THEN CALCULATES THE OUTER-INNER CONTRASTIVE FEATURES OF THE PROPOSALS.
utt_0054 utt 282.79 293.32 -X BY TAKING SURROUNDING CONTRASTIVE INFORMATION INTO CONSIDERATION, THOSE DISCRIMINATIVE SHORT PROPOSALS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY SUPPRESSED.
utt_0056 utt 293.32 307.55 -X SECONDLY, WE PROPOSE A PROPOSAL COMPLETENESS EVALUATION MODULE (PCE), AS SHOWN IN FIGURE (C), WHICH TREATS HIGH CONFIDENCE PROPOSALS AS PSEUDO-INSTANCES, AND THEN THE COMPLETENESS
utt_0058 utt 307.55 314.01 -X PSEUDO-LABEL OF EACH PROPOSAL CAN BE ACQUIRED BY CALCULATING THE INTERSECTION-OVER-UNION
utt_0059 utt 314.50 317.80 -X (IOU) WITH THE PSEUDO-INSTANCES.
utt_0060 utt 317.80 324.40 -X UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE COMPLETENESS PSEUDO-LABEL, LOW-QUALITY PROPOSALS CAN BE SUPPRESSED.
utt_0062 utt 324.58 332.27 -X FINALLY, WE PROPOSE AN INSTANCE-LEVEL RANK CONSISTENCY LOSS (IRC), AS SHOWN IN FIGURE
utt_0067 utt 349.94 351.31 -X THE STATE-OF-THE-ART PERFORMANCE.
utt_0071 utt 360.14 360.82 -X CASES IN S-MIL.
utt_0073 utt 365.10 368.08 -X AND MISSED DETECTION ISSUES.
utt_0077 utt 376.95 378.23 -6.2614 THANKS FOR THE ATTENTION!
