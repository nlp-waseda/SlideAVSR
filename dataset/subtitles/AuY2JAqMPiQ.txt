utt_0000 utt 0.26 13.33 -X HELLO I'M SUHAIL AND TODAY I'LL BE DEMONSTRATING RELIC: A SYSTEM FOR RETROSPECTIVE LINEAGE INFERENCE OF DATA WORKFLOWS. CONSIDER A SCENARIO IN WHICH YOU'VE JUST RECOVERED SOME FILES FROM A DATA LAKE AND YOU'VE STARTED THE PROCESS OF SIFTING THROUGH THESE RECOVERED FILES. YOU WOULD LIKE TO
utt_0003 utt 13.33 27.70 -X KNOW HOW THESE ARTIFACTS RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. FURTHERMORE YOU CAN ASSUME THAT TIMESTAMPS AND OTHER METADATA THAT'S PROVIDED BY THE FILE SYSTEM MAY BE UNRELIABLE SO YOU HAVE TO RELY SOLELY ON THE CONTENTS OF THESE FILES TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW THEY EVOLVED FROM EACH OTHER. IF WE KNOW THAT THE
utt_0006 utt 27.70 37.30 -X FILES ARE SOMEHOW RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER THROUGH SOME DATA WORKFLOW, WHAT WE WANT IS A WAY TO CONSTRUCT A TREE OR A DERIVATION GRAPH THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE FILES. MORE FORMALLY,
utt_0008 utt 37.30 48.29 -X IS THERE A WAY TO CONSTRUCT A TREE THAT MOST CLOSELY REPRESENTS THE TRUE DERIVATION OF THE ARTIFACTS FROM ONE ANOTHER, AS MEASURED BY THE EDGE Fone SCORE WHEN COMPARED TO THE GROUND TRUTH. OUR SYSTEM RELIC
utt_0010 utt 48.29 61.53 -X DOES JUST THAT. WE USE VARIOUS SIMILARITY METRICS TO HYPOTHESIZE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE ARTIFACTS ASSUMING THAT ARTIFACTS THAT ARE MORE SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM ONE ANOTHER. OUR SYSTEM CONSTRUCTS A DERIVATION TREE IN STAGES WE FIRST CLUSTER
utt_0013 utt 61.53 75.83 -X ALL OF OUR ARTIFACTS BY SCHEMA. WE THEN FIND RELATIONSHIPS THAT INVOLVE FINE-GRAINED CHANGES TO ARTIFACTS SUCH AS CELL-LEVEL EDITS OR OTHER ROW/COLUMN OPERATIONS USING JACCARD SIMILARITY AND CONTAINMENT SCORES APPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL TABLE VALUES. FOR MORE COMPLEX OPERATIONS WE
utt_0016 utt 75.83 86.97 -X HAVE DESIGNED OPERATION-SPECIFIC DETECTORS THAT USE VALUE SET CONTAINMENT AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS OF THE TABLE TO FIND JOIN, GROUP-BY, AND PIVOT OPERATIONS. ADDITIONAL DETECTORS MAY BE DESIGNED
utt_0018 utt 86.97 93.59 -X FOR OTHER OPERATIONS OR UDFS AND IS LEFT AS A FUTURE WORK. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT RELIC IN ACTION
utt_0019 utt 95.19 106.97 -X FOR USER INPUT I HAVE SEVEN .CSV FILES BELONGING TO A SINGLE DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW ZIPPED IN THIS FILE. IF WE UNZIP THIS FILE AND INSPECT THE INDIVIDUAL ARTIFACTS, WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE
utt_0021 utt 106.97 111.83 -X A FEW SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED TABLES THAT HAVE BEEN MODIFIED USING PANDAS OPERATIONS.
utt_0022 utt 112.76 115.61 -X I ALSO HAVE A GROUND TRUTH ANNOTATION FOR THIS WORKFLOW
utt_0023 utt 116.47 126.65 -X THE GROUND TRUTH SHOWS THE SOURCE AND DESTINATION EDGES IN THE ACTUAL GROUND TRUTH WHICH WAS USED TO GENERATE THAT WORKFLOW AS WELL AS SOME DATA INDICATING WHAT OPERATION
utt_0025 utt 126.65 132.12 -X WAS USED TO GO FROM THE SOURCE TO THE DESTINATION AND SOME OF ITS PARAMETERS.
utt_0026 utt 132.76 143.33 -X FEEDING THESE INTO RELIC THE USER ALSO HAS AN OPTION TO TOGGLE SOME PARAMETERS SUCH AS WHETHER RELIC SHOULD FIRST CLUSTER THE ARTIFACTS BY SCHEMA AND THEN START BY ADDING THOSE EDGES TO
utt_0028 utt 143.33 155.93 -X THE WORKFLOW, OR NOT, AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SIMILARITY SCORES AND DETECTORS TO BE USED IN RELIC. FURTHERMORE THE USER CAN SET EDGE RETENTION THRESHOLDS FOR SIMILARITY SCORES FOR ARTIFACTS
utt_0030 utt 155.93 166.94 -X THAT GO BETWEEN ARTIFACTS IN THE CLUSTER AND ACROSS CLUSTERS. ONCE WE CLICK THE INFER LINEAGE BUTTON OUR ZIP FILE AND GROUND TRUTH ARE UPLOADED TO THE RELIC SYSTEM WHICH THEN COMPUTES THE
utt_0032 utt 166.94 178.91 -X PAIRWISE SCORES RUNS THE DETECTORS AND GRADUALLY BUILDS THE GRAPH THE UI WILL THEN RENDER THE GRAPH FOR US. THIS GRAPH IS INTERACTIVE THE USER CAN CLICK AND DRAG THE GRAPH TO VIEW VARIOUS PARTS
utt_0034 utt 178.91 193.12 -X OF THE GRAPH AS WELL AS CLICK TO REPOSITION NODES AND EXPLORE THE GRAPH. THE USER CAN ALSO CLICK ON ANY NODE AT ANY TIME TO INSPECT THE ARTIFACT THAT IS REPRESENTED BY THAT NODE. IN THIS ARTIFACT
utt_0036 utt 193.12 199.62 -X INSPECTOR THE INDIVIDUAL TABLES CAN BE INSPECTED ALONG WITH SORTING AND SEARCHING CAPABILITIES.
utt_0037 utt 199.81 208.87 -X YOU CAN ALSO OPEN UP THE LEGEND. GREEN EDGES ARE EDGES THAT RELIC INFERRED CORRECTLY VIS-A-VIS
utt_0038 utt 208.87 215.40 -X THE GROUND TRUTH AND ARE THUS TRUE POSITIVE EDGES. RED EDGES ARE FALSE POSITIVE EDGES WHERE RELIC
utt_0039 utt 215.46 228.81 -X INFERRED THE EDGE INCORRECTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE GROUND TRUTH. A BLACK EDGE WITH AN 'X' IS A FALSE NEGATIVE EDGE WHICH RELIC MISSED, AS THIS EDGE WAS IN THE GROUND TRUTH BUT WAS NOT INFERRED BY RELIC.
utt_0041 utt 228.90 240.47 -X IN CASE RELIC IS USED WITHOUT GROUND TRUTH ANNOTATION OR CLUSTERING YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH A SIMPLE GRAPH WITHOUT ANY NODE COLORING OR EDGE COLORING. NODE COLORING IN
utt_0043 utt 240.47 247.34 -X THIS GRAPH DENOTES THE ARTIFACTS THAT BELONG TO THE SAME CLUSTER. WE HAVE A FEW CANNED DEMOS AS
utt_0044 utt 247.34 262.25 -X WELL SOME OF WHICH ARE CRAWLED JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS FROM GITHUB AS WELL AS AZUREML. AS WE CAN SEE RELIC DEMONSTRATES REASONABLY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN FINDING LINEAGE FOR MANY OF THESE WORKFLOWS.
utt_0046 utt 263.21 276.55 -X WE ALSO HAVE A SYNTHETIC WORKFLOW CONSISTING OF fifty PLUS ARTIFACTS WITH ABOUT FIVE OR SO EDGES WHICH RELIC INFERRED INCORRECTLY. LET'S WRAP UP THIS DEMO WITH A FEW KEY TAKEAWAYS...
utt_0048 utt 276.55 282.76 -X THE RELIC SYSTEM JUST DEMONSTRATED CAN INFER THE THE LINEAGE OF TABULAR DATA ARTIFACTS RETROSPECTIVELY.
utt_0049 utt 282.76 295.60 -X THE SYSTEM USES FINE-GRAINED SIMILARITY METRICS AND COARSER DETECTORS TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ARTIFACTS AND PRODUCES A LINEAGE TREE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TOOL CAN BE USED FOR DATA LAKE ORGANIZATION, FORENSIC ANALYSIS, AND OTHER DOWNSTREAM DATA ACTIVITIES.
utt_0052 utt 295.82 298.89 -4.6689 THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST I AM READY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.
