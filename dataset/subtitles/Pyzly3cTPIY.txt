utt_0000 utt 0.13 7.60 -X HI EVERYONE, MY NAME IS MIRKO GELSOMINI AND TODAY I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO IMAGINE - EMBODIED LEARNING IN IMMERSIVE SMART SPACES.
utt_0002 utt 7.88 15.98 -X THIS WORK HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AT POLITECNICO DI MILANO BY ME, MIRKO GELSOMINI, GIULIA LEONARDI AND FRANCA GARZOTTO.
utt_0004 utt 17.48 31.51 -X THIS WORK INVESTIGATES THE PEDAGOGICAL POTENTIAL OF IMAGINE, AN IMMERSIVE INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES WHERE CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO AUDITORY AND VISUAL STIMULI, ACTIVATED BY PERFORMING MID-AIR GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS IN A DIGITALLY ENHANCED PHYSICAL SPACE.
utt_0007 utt 31.51 43.47 -X THE SYSTEM IS REMOTELY CONTROLLED BY THE TEACHER, WHO CAN CUSTOMIZE EACH EXPERIENCE ACCORDING TO GROUP'S OR INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS, MODIFYING INTENSITY, DURATION AND ORCHESTRATION OF STIMULI AND ACTION-STIMULUS SEQUENCES.
utt_0010 utt 47.98 58.61 -X EMBODIED COGNITION THEORIES EMPHASIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND ARE SUPPORTED BY A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEURO-BIOLOGY.
utt_0013 utt 58.93 71.44 -X ACCORDING TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EMBODIMENT CAN ENHANCE THE LEARNING PROCESS, WE HAVE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED AN EDUCATIONAL DIDACTIC EXPERIENCE WITHIN IMAGINE AIMED AT FACILITATING LEARNING OF FACTUAL KNOWLEDGE ON A CURRICULAR SUBJECT.
utt_0016 utt 72.33 87.16 -X THE EXPERIENCE IS MODELED FOLLOWING KOLB'S EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING PROCESS ACCORDING TO THE CYCLIC SEQUENCE OF EXPERIENCE-REFLECTION-LEARNING AND IS DIVIDED INTO THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF CHALLENGE &AMP INITIAL THOUGHTS, RESOURCES AND ASSESSMENT.
utt_0019 utt 87.98 97.36 -X IN THE VERY FIRST PHASE, CHILDREN ARE WELCOMED IN IMAGINE AND THE TEACHER PRESENTS THE TOPIC THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED DURING THE LESSON MAKING USE OF IMAGES PROJECTED ON THE WALL AND ON THE FLOOR.
utt_0022 utt 97.71 103.12 -X SHE THEN COLLECTS STUDENTS' QUESTIONS AND ELICITS CHILDREN'S DISCUSSION FROM PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE.
utt_0024 utt 104.27 119.16 -X DURING THE RESOURCES PHASE, A five-MINUTES VIDEO IS PROJECTED TO THE WALL: WHEN THE PROJECTION ENDS, CHILDREN ARE CALLED IN TURNS, ONE AT A TIME, TO PERFORM A TASK, WHICH CONSISTS OF ANSWERING A PROPOSED QUESTION USING ONE OF THE GIVEN INTERACTION TYPES.
utt_0027 utt 121.07 125.52 -X LASTLY, CHILDREN ARE EVALUATED ON THEIR ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE.
utt_0028 utt 125.59 131.96 -X THE STRUCTURE OF EACH SINGLE TASK WAS DESIGNED ON THE BASIS OF THE TEXTBOOKS CURRENTLY USED IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS.
utt_0030 utt 132.27 143.22 -X FROM THE ANALYSIS, five TYPES OF FREQUENTLY USED EXERCISES HAVE EMERGED, CROSS-CUTTING DIFFERENT SUBJECTS, WHICH WE HAVE REINTERPRETED WITH A VIEW TO MOTION-BASED INTERACTION.
utt_0032 utt 143.28 153.27 -X THE FIRST, THE SELECTION PATTERN PRESENTS THE USER WITH AN EXPLANATORY IMAGE OF THE QUESTION ON THE FRONT PROJECTION AND A VARIABLE NUMBER OF RESPONSE OPTION CARDS ON THE FLOOR PROJECTION.
utt_0035 utt 153.43 159.41 -X A STAR PROJECTED ON THE FLOOR, PLACED IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE USER'S FEET, FOLLOWS THE STUDENT'S MOVEMENTS.
utt_0037 utt 159.51 164.09 -X IN ORDER TO SELECT THE CHOSEN ANSWER, THE CHILD MUST PLACE THE STAR, AND CONSEQUENTLY
utt_0038 utt 164.11 168.18 -X HERSELF, OVER THE CARD CORRESPONDING TO THE OPTION DEEMED CORRECT.
utt_0039 utt 168.47 172.61 -X THE CHILD CONFIRMS HER DECISION STANDING OVER THE CARD FOR AT LEAST three SECONDS
utt_0040 utt 173.33 182.74 -X THE SECOND PATTERN, THE CLASSIFICATION, PRESENTS THE USER WITH A SET OF IMAGES AND A SERIES OF LABELLED BOXES, BOTH PROJECTED ON THE FRONT PROJECTION.
utt_0042 utt 182.74 187.06 -X A VIRTUAL SUPERIMPOSED HAND APPEARS, FOLLOWING THE PREFERRED USER'S HAND.
utt_0043 utt 187.70 193.67 -X THE USER IS ASKED TO GRAB, DRAG EACH OF THE IMAGES PRESENTED AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN
utt_0044 utt 193.68 200.76 -X AND RELEASE EACH OF THEM IN THE CORRECT CATEGORY, SHOWN IN THE FORM OF A BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONTAL SCREEN.
utt_0046 utt 200.85 207.32 -X THE THIRD CASE, THE REORDERING PATTERN PRESENTS THE USER WITH A SERIES OF IMAGES RANDOMLY ORDERED ON THE FRONT SCREEN.
utt_0048 utt 207.48 212.06 -X A VIRTUAL SUPERIMPOSED HAND APPEARS, FOLLOWING THE PREFERRED USER'S HAND.
utt_0049 utt 212.06 217.91 -X THE USER IS ASKED TO REORDER THE OPTION CARDS ACCORDING TO A SEQUENCE CONTEXTUALIZED BY THE QUESTION.
utt_0051 utt 217.91 224.60 -X TO REORDER THE CARDS, THE CHILD IS REQUIRED TO GRAB, DRAG AND RELEASE EACH ELEMENT UNTIL THE DESIRED SEQUENCE IS OBTAINED.
utt_0053 utt 224.69 231.32 -X A POP-UP WILL ASK THE USER TO CONFIRM OR CANCEL THE RESPONSE GIVEN AFTER five SECONDS FROM HER LAST INTERACTION.
utt_0055 utt 233.30 238.39 -X THE IDENTIFICATION PATTERN REQUIRES USERS TO RECOGNIZE A GIVEN OBJECT BASED ON ITS CHARACTERISTICS.
utt_0056 utt 238.68 241.47 -X TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF IDENTIFICATION ARE SUPPORTED.
utt_0057 utt 242.01 244.51 -X THE FOURTH ONE IS BASED ON COLOR AND SHAPE.
utt_0058 utt 244.51 248.22 -X A VARIABLE NUMBER OF IMAGES ARE RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED ON BOTH PROJECTIONS.
utt_0059 utt 248.57 255.29 -X THE USER HAS TO IDENTIFY THE ITEM REQUESTED IN THE QUESTION AND SELECT IT BY POSITIONING HER BODY OR BY MOVING AND CLOSING HER HAND.
utt_0061 utt 256.37 258.52 -X THE FIFTH ONE IS BASED ON POSITION.
utt_0062 utt 258.52 261.79 -X A VARIABLE NUMBER OF IMAGES ARE ARRANGED NEATLY ON THE FRONT SCREEN.
utt_0063 utt 261.81 267.16 -X THE USER HAS TO IDENTIFY THE ITEM REQUESTED BY THE QUESTION BY MOVING AND CLOSING HER HAND ON ITS TOP.
utt_0065 utt 267.77 275.83 -X THE SIXTH ONE, THE ASSOCIATION PATTERN PRESENTS USERS WITH FOUR FRAMES AT THE TOP AND FOUR ITEMS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT PROJECTION.
utt_0067 utt 275.83 280.32 -X EACH FRAME CONTAINS TWO SLOTS, ONE HOUSING AN IMAGE AND THE OTHER EMPTY.
utt_0068 utt 280.89 290.24 -X THE USER IS ASKED TO ASSOCIATE (GRAB, DRAG AND RELEASE) EACH BOTTOM ITEM WITH THE IMAGES PRESENTED IN THE FRAMES, PLACING THE OBJECTS IN THE FREE FRAME SLOTS.
utt_0070 utt 290.84 296.06 -X ONCE ALL OBJECTS ARE PLACED IN THE CORRESPONDING SLOTS, A POP-UP ASKS TO CONFIRM OR RETRY.
utt_0071 utt 296.89 304.38 -X IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER IMAGINE CAN ACTUALLY FACILITATE CHILDREN'S LEARNING, A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED.
utt_0073 utt 305.46 314.91 -X AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE IMAGE, THE STUDY IS BASED ON THE COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LEARNING PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE IN A TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM AND THE ONE OCCURRING IN IMAGINE,
utt_0075 utt 315.13 319.64 -X WITH THE AIM OF COMPARING IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S LEARNING ACHIEVEMENTS.
utt_0076 utt 321.18 324.51 -X seventy CHILDREN FROM six TO eight YEARS OLD WERE RECRUITED.
utt_0077 utt 324.57 339.39 -X THEY WERE PAIR-WISE ASSIGNED ACCORDING TO PERFORMANCE ON A PRETEST TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (ON THE LEFT), SUBJECTED TO THE PRACTICE WITHIN IMAGINE ENVIRONMENT AND TO A CONTROL GROUP (ON THE RIGHT), SUBJECTED TO THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICE BASED ON THE FRONTAL BOOK-BASED APPROACH
utt_0080 utt 339.39 340.25 -X WITHIN THE CLASSROOM.
utt_0081 utt 340.44 345.50 -X BOTH GROUPS WERE DIVIDED IN CLASSES, ACCORDINGLY.
utt_0082 utt 345.50 354.01 -X THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES A MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION: CAN LEARNING BENEFIT FROM AN IMMERSIVE EMBODIED APPROACH COMPARED TO A TRADITIONAL PAPER-BASED CLASSROOM APPROACH?
utt_0084 utt 356.15 362.27 -X A BASELINE TEST Tzero WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST WEEK, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH
utt_0085 utt 362.87 365.50 -X HOMOGENEOUS CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS.
utt_0086 utt 366.04 370.72 -X TWO LEARNING SESSIONS OF one HOUR EACH WERE HELD IN TWO SEPARATE DAYS OF THE FIRST WEEK
utt_0087 utt 370.91 374.08 -X (SAME AMOUNT OF TIME DEDICATED TO SIMILAR TOPICS AT SCHOOL).
utt_0088 utt 375.29 383.46 -X A SHORT-TERM TEST Tone AND A LONG-TERM TEST Ttwo WERE PROVIDED ON THE LAST WEEKDAY OF THE FIRST WEEK AND AFTER SEVEN WEEKS RESPECTIVELY.
utt_0090 utt 384.03 392.48 -X BOTH IMAGINE AND CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES USED THE SAME EXERCISES, PROPOSED IN THE SAME SEQUENCE AND WITH THE SAME GRAPHICAL CONTENTS.
utt_0092 utt 393.18 406.18 -X THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION AFTER TWO TRAINING SESSIONS, WHICH WE REFER AS SHORT TERM RETENTION, WAS EVALUATED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE VALUES OF THE SCORE OBTAINED DURING Tone WITH RESPECT TO THAT ACHIEVED WITH THE BASELINE TEST IN Tzero.
utt_0095 utt 408.12 413.31 -X SHORT TERM RETENTION WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR BOTH GROUPS AS THEY SCORED AN AVERAGE OF eighteen NOTIONS.
utt_0096 utt 413.50 420.74 -X THIS ALLOWS US TO STATE THAT IMAGINE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE A COMPARABLY EFFECTIVE TEACHING TOOL WITH RESPECT TO CLASSROOM APPROACHES.
utt_0098 utt 421.02 426.05 -X WE CATEGORIZED EACH OF THE TWO GROUPS INTO TERTILES BASED ON SHORT TERM RETENTION SCORES.
utt_0099 utt 426.17 433.95 -X THE FIRST TERTILE CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE RETAINED FEWER CONCEPTS AND, THEREFORE, PROBABLY THOSE WHO HAVE ENCOUNTERED MORE DIFFICULTIES.
utt_0101 utt 433.95 440.77 -X THE THIRD TERTILE IS ASSOCIATED TO THOSE CHILDREN WHO ACQUIRED MORE CONCEPTS, WHICH WE CAN ASSUME HAVE HAD FEWER DIFFICULTIES.
utt_0103 utt 440.77 447.11 -X CONSEQUENTLY, THE SECOND TERTILE REPRESENTS THE GROUP OF CHILDREN WHOSE SHORT TERM RETENTION IS IN THE MIDDLE RANGE.
utt_0105 utt 447.11 454.31 -X CHILDREN BELONGING TO THE FIRST TERTILE RETAINED AN AVERAGE OF eight CONCEPTS IN CLASS AND AN AVERAGE OF eleven NOTIONS IN IMAGINE.
utt_0107 utt 454.31 459.23 -X RESULTS ARE REVERSED IN THE THIRD TERTILE, IN WHICH CHILDREN IN THE CONTROL GROUP LEARNED
utt_0108 utt 460.06 465.12 -X AN AVERAGE OF twenty-seven CONCEPTS, COMPARED TO twenty-five ACQUIRED BY THE CHILDREN IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP.
utt_0110 utt 465.66 471.39 -X IN THE SECOND TERTILE, CHILDREN LEARNED AN AVERAGE OF seventeen CONCEPTS, REGARDLESS THE LEARNING CONTEXT.
utt_0112 utt 471.39 483.81 -X SPEAKING ABOUT LONG-TERM RETENTION, THE VALUES ON MEMORY LOSS, THAT IS THE NUMBER OF FORGOTTEN NOTIONS BETWEEN Tone AND Ttwo, SHOW THAT STUDENTS FROM FIRST TERTILE FORGOT IN AVERAGE seven point seven AND
utt_0114 utt 485.57 489.00 -X six point six NOTIONS IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RESPECTIVELY.
utt_0115 utt 489.25 497.03 -X ALMOST THE SAME DIFFERENCE OCCURRED IN SECOND TERTILE STUDENTS, WHO LOST eight NOTIONS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AGAINST seven NOTIONS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP.
utt_0117 utt 497.44 510.56 -X THE HIGHEST MEMORY LOSS CAN BE NOTICED IN THE THIRD TERTILE, IN WHICH STUDENTS WHO LEARNT IN CLASSROOM FORGOT BETWEEN eight AND twenty-four NOTIONS AND THOSE WHO PRACTISED IN IMAGINE FORGOT BETWEEN NONE AND eleven NOTIONS.
utt_0120 utt 512.61 522.92 -X IN CONCLUSION, EACH CHILD MEMORIZED AN AVERAGE OF eighteen CONCEPTS IN THE SHORT TERM AND RETAINED seven NOTIONS WHEN LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM AND MORE THAN eleven NOTIONS WHEN LEARNING IN IMAGINE IN THE LONG TERM.
utt_0123 utt 523.39 528.07 -X CHILDREN WITH MORE LEARNING DIFFICULTIES FOUND IT EASIER TO MEMORIZE WITHIN IMAGINE.
utt_0124 utt 528.07 538.79 -X THE BETTER OUTCOME COULD BE ASCRIBED TO THE EFFECT OF THE WIDE RANGE OF DIFFERENT INTERACTION MODES AND THE VARIOUS SENSES INVOLVED, WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO MORE EASILY FIND THE LEARNING MODALITY SUITABLE FOR THEIR NATURAL INCLINATIONS.
utt_0127 utt 539.27 548.93 -X IN ADDITION, THE EVIDENT GREATER EASE WITH WHICH THE TEACHER HAS CARRIED OUT TEACHING SESSIONS WITHIN IMAGINE, ALLOWS US TO DEDUCE THAT IT ACTED AS A CATALYST OF ATTENTION,
utt_0129 utt 548.93 550.34 -X THUS IMPROVING RETENTION.
utt_0130 utt 551.07 554.12 -X FINALLY, WE PRESENT HERE THE CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS.
utt_0131 utt 555.04 560.13 -X THE RESULTS OF OUR EMPIRICAL STUDY ARE ENCOURAGING, AS WE DETECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN PARTICIPANTS'
utt_0132 utt 560.13 564.39 -X LONG TERM RETENTION SKILLS THAT COULD BE ASCRIBED TO THE EXPERIENCES IN IMAGINE.
utt_0133 utt 564.61 574.53 -X FROM A BROADER PERSPECTIVE, OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MOTION-BASED IMMERSIVE TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT EMBODIED LEARNING ACTIVITIES IN REGULAR SCHOOL CONTEXTS IS A PROMISING APPROACH, AND
utt_0135 utt 574.53 583.21 -X SMART SPACES CHARACTERIZED BY LOW-MEDIUM EMBODIMENT LIKE IMAGINE MIGHT LEAD TO REVISIT EXISTING EDUCATIONAL PROCESSES AS WELL AS TO REINVENT NEW ONES.
utt_0137 utt 584.39 597.51 -X IN THE FUTURE, WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THE POTENTIAL OF MOTION SENSING TECHNOLOGIES BY DESIGNING FULL-BODY ACTIVITIES THAT MAKE USE OF ICONIC AND REPRESENTATIONAL GESTURES SO TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE AFFORDANCES OF IMAGINE.
utt_0140 utt 597.51 607.59 -X WE WILL EXPAND THE STUDY TO A LARGER NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WHO WILL BE INVOLVED FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME, TRACKING THEIR PERFORMANCES WITHIN EACH LEARNING SESSION.
utt_0142 utt 607.59 613.51 -X SUCH RESEARCH WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF A CORPUS OF DATA ON CHILDREN'S BODILY LEARNING,
utt_0143 utt 613.51 616.97 -X UNIQUE IN THIS FIELD AND VALUABLE FOR EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE AND RESEARCH.
utt_0144 utt 617.67 629.03 -X EVENTUALLY, THIS ENVIRONMENT STILL HOLDS PROMISE IN SUPPORTING CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS IN MAINSTREAM EDUCATION, GIVEN ITS PLETHORA OF INTERACTION MODALITIES AND STIMULUS THAT
utt_0146 utt 629.03 634.95 -X CAN BE CAREFULLY SELECTED BY THE TEACHER TO GIVE SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS CHILDREN THE BEST TAILORED EXPERIENCE.
utt_0148 utt 636.77 644.97 -X CONCLUDING, WE THANK POLISOCIAL AWARD, THE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM OF POLITECNICO DI MILANO AND THE MUNICIPALITY OF CORNAREDO FOR HAVING FUNDED THE PROJECT.
utt_0150 utt 645.57 655.59 -X WE THANK ALSO LUDOMI TEAM, THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AT ISTITUTO COMPRENSIVO STATALE VIA four NOVEMBRE, CORNAREDO (MILANO) AND ISTITUTO COMPRENSIVO STATALE LEONARDO DA VINCI, CORNAREDO (MILANO).
