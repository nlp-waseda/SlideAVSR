utt_0000 utt 1.77 7.09 -X HELLO, EVERYONE! I‚ÄôM HANSHENG CHEN CURRENTLY A MASTER STUDENT AT TONGJI UNIVERSITY
utt_0002 utt 7.63 11.22 -X AND I WAS A RESEARCH INTERN AT ALIBABA DAMO ACADEMY
utt_0003 utt 12.20 14.86 -X HERE I‚ÄôM VERY GLAD TO PRESENT OUR WORK
utt_0004 utt 14.99 22.30 -X EPRO-PNP: GENERALIZED END-TO-END PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE-N-POINTS FOR MONOCULAR OBJECT POSE ESTIMATION
utt_0006 utt 25.29 29.97 -X IN THIS PAPER WE INVESTIGATE A LONG-STANDING PROBLEM IN COMPUTER VISION
utt_0007 utt 30.00 33.78 -X THAT IS, LOCATING threeD OBJECTS FROM A SINGLE RGB IMAGE
utt_0008 utt 34.57 38.42 -X GIVEN AN IMAGE CONTAINING THE PROJECTION OF A threeD OBJECT
utt_0009 utt 38.77 43.76 -X OUR GOAL IS TO FIND A RIGID BODY TRANSFORMATION FROM THE OBJECT FRAME TO THE CAMERA FRAME
utt_0010 utt 44.21 51.63 -X THIS IS CALLED THE OBJECT POSE, DENOTED BY Y AND IT CAN BE DECOMPOSED INTO THE ORIENTATION COMPONENT AND THE POSITION COMPONENT
utt_0012 utt 53.45 58.56 -X TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, A MAJOR CATEGORY OF METHODS IS DIRECT POSE PREDICTION
utt_0013 utt 58.73 63.63 -X OR THE EXPLICIT METHOD WHICH IS VERY POPULAR IN threeD OBJECT DETECTION
utt_0015 utt 64.88 75.01 -X TYPICALLY, WE BUILD A FEED-FORWARD NETWORK THAT PREDICTS THE twoD LOCATION, THE DEPTH, AND THE ORIENTATION OF THE OBJECT SO WITH ANNOTATED TRAINING DATA
utt_0018 utt 75.25 89.27 -X A LOSS FUNCTION CAN BE DESIGNED TO DIRECTLY SUPERVISE THE OBJECT POSE SO THIS METHOD BENEFITS A LOT FROM A SIMPLE END-TO-END TRAINING PIPELINE BUT THE PROBLEM IS, IT LACKS INTERPRETABILITY AND MAY BE PRONE TO OVERFITTING
utt_0022 utt 91.31 93.87 -X ANOTHER CATEGORY IS GOING IMPLICIT
utt_0023 utt 93.93 96.72 -X THAT IS GEOMETRY-BASED POSE ESTIMATION
utt_0024 utt 96.78 103.28 -X WHICH IS VERY POPULAR IN sixDOF POSE ESTIMATION TASK WHERE OBJECT SHAPES ARE KNOWN A PRIORI
utt_0026 utt 103.95 107.09 -X HERE WE FOCUS ON THE MOST COMMON METHOD
utt_0027 utt 107.12 109.91 -X THE PERSPECTIVE-N-POINT OR PNP METHOD
utt_0028 utt 110.32 116.18 -X IN THIS METHOD, WE FIRST NEED TO FIND N POINTS IN BOTH THE IMAGE AND THE OBJECT FRAME
utt_0029 utt 116.46 118.36 -X WITH threeD COORDINATES XthreeD
utt_0030 utt 119.06 120.31 -X twoD COORDINATES XtwoD
utt_0031 utt 120.43 123.67 -X AND OPTIONALLY THE CORRESPONDING WEIGHTS WtwoD
utt_0032 utt 124.94 126.96 -X FROM THESE N POINTS
utt_0033 utt 127.02 132.85 -X THE OBJECT POSE IS IMPLICITLY DEFINED AS THE SOLUTION TO AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM
utt_0034 utt 133.01 138.31 -X THAT MEANS, WE CAN FIND THE OPTIMAL POSE THAT COMPLIES WITH THE PROJECTION RULES
utt_0035 utt 138.74 140.47 -X WHERE EVERY PROJECTED threeD POINT
utt_0036 utt 140.82 144.23 -X SHALL COINCIDE WITH THE CORRESPONDING twoD POINT IN THE IMAGE
utt_0037 utt 145.01 153.91 -X FORMALLY, THE PNP SOLVER MINIMIZES THE CUMULATIVE SQUARED WEIGHTED REPROJECTION ERROR WHERE THE ERROR OF EACH POINT IS A FUNCTION F OF THE OBJECT POSE Y
utt_0039 utt 155.82 159.70 -X TODAY, PNP METHODS ARE OFTEN COMBINED WITH DEEP LEARNING
utt_0040 utt 159.73 165.96 -X THE COMMON INFERENCE PIPELINE IS TO DEPLOY A FEED-FORWARD NETWORK TO PREDICT THE twoDminus threeD CORRESPONDENCE SET X
utt_0042 utt 166.16 169.72 -X AND THEN SOLVE THE OBJECT POSE VIA A PNP SOLVER
utt_0043 utt 170.26 179.77 -X THIS COMBINED MODEL HAS MUCH BETTER INTERPRETABILITY AND STABLE GENERALIZATION PERFORMANCE BUT THE TRAINING METHODS IN PRIOR WORK ARE RATHER LIMITED
utt_0045 utt 180.82 194.52 -X MOST OF THE METHODS RELY HEAVILY ON A SURROGATE LOSS THAT SUPERVISES THESE INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES WHICH IS NOT OPTIMAL FOR BEST POSE ACCURACY FOR EXAMPLE, SOME DEFINES A COUPLE OF threeD KEYPOINTS IN THE OBJECT FRAME
utt_0049 utt 194.61 198.20 -X SO THE GOAL IS TO FIND THE twoD KEYPOINTS IN THE IMAGE
utt_0050 utt 198.87 204.41 -X ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS DENSE CORRESPONDENCE WHERE EVERY PIXEL OF THE IMAGE IS TAKEN AS A twoD POINT
utt_0052 utt 204.66 209.05 -X SO WE NEED TO PREDICT THE DENSE threeD COORDINATES AND A SEGMENTATION MASK
utt_0053 utt 210.07 216.17 -X HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE METHODS ARE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SINCE ONLY A PART OF THE VARIABLES ARE LEARNED
utt_0055 utt 217.36 219.70 -X WHAT IF WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW THE OBJECT SHAPE AT ALL
utt_0056 utt 219.86 223.99 -X AND ALL THESE INTERMEDIATE VARIABLES HAVE TO BE LEARNED FROM SCRATCH?
utt_0057 utt 225.49 229.64 -X AND THAT BRINGS OUR ATTENTION TO THE END-TO-END POSE LOSS
utt_0058 utt 229.97 234.89 -X WHICH BACKPROPATES THROUGH THE OPTIMIZATION LAYER VIA IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION
utt_0059 utt 235.51 238.01 -X BUT THE TRAINING IS STILL VERY UNSTABLE
utt_0060 utt 238.29 241.91 -X SINCE ARGMIN FUNCTION IS GENERALLY NON-DIFFERENTIABLE
utt_0061 utt 242.93 245.43 -X HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS ISSUE
utt_0062 utt 246.36 251.35 -X A CHANGE IN THE CORRESPONDENCE X WILL CAUSE A CHANGE OF THE COST FUNCTION
utt_0063 utt 251.51 254.04 -X HENCE A CHANGE OF THE OPTIMAL POSE Y*
utt_0064 utt 254.04 260.60 -X BUT SOMETIMES THE CHANGE IS DISCONTINUOUS AS THE GLOBAL OPTIMUM JUMPS FROM ONE MODE TO ANOTHER
utt_0066 utt 262.52 265.27 -X SO, TO ACHIEVE STABLE END-TO-END TRAINING
utt_0067 utt 265.43 274.20 -X WE INTRODUCE THE END-TO-END PROBABILISTIC PERSPECTIVE-N-POINT LAYER THE IDEA TO INTERPRET THE POSE AS A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION
utt_0069 utt 274.23 277.18 -X WHOSE PROBABILITY DENSITY IS ALWAYS DIFFERENTIABLE
utt_0070 utt 277.94 284.63 -X WE FIRST DEFINE A LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE REPROJECTION ERROR AND WITH UNINFORMATIVE PRIOR
utt_0072 utt 284.69 289.11 -X NORMALIZING THE LIKELIHOOD YIELDS THE POSTERIOR PROBABILITY DENSITY
utt_0073 utt 289.84 298.70 -X THIS FORMULATION CAN BE ALSO REGARDED AS A CONTINUOUS COUNTERPART OF THE CATEGORICAL SOFTMAX FUNCTION WHICH IS WIDELY USED IN CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS
utt_0075 utt 299.16 306.49 -X SO ESSENTIALLY, EPRO-PNP REPLACES THE REGULAR ARGMIN FUNCTION WITH A DIFFERENTIABLE SOFTARGMIN
utt_0076 utt 308.69 314.33 -X DURING TRAINING, GIVEN THE GROUND TRUTH POSE WE CAN DEFINE A TARGET POSE DISTRIBUTION
utt_0078 utt 314.71 318.51 -X AND MINIMIZE THE KL DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE TARGET AND PREDICTION
utt_0079 utt 318.90 322.49 -X AGAIN THIS IS ANALOGOUS TO THE CATEGORICAL CROSS-ENTROPY LOSS
utt_0080 utt 322.52 332.07 -X BUT ON A CONTINUOUS DOMAIN WITH THE KL DIVERGENCE LOSS WE MAKE SURE THAT ALL POTENTIAL POSE SOLUTIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOSS FUNCTION
utt_0083 utt 332.44 334.78 -X WHICH GUARANTEES GLOBAL CONVERGENCE
utt_0084 utt 337.62 345.27 -X AS FOR THE TARGET DISTRIBUTION WE USE DIRAC DELTA DISTRIBUTION WHOSE VARIANCE APPROACHES ZERO WHICH YIELDS THIS SIMPLIFIED LOSS FUNCTION
utt_0087 utt 345.91 351.42 -X TAKING THE GRADIENTS AND WE CAN SEE THAT IT TRIES TO MINIMIZE THE REPROJECTION ERROR AT TARGET POSE
utt_0088 utt 351.54 354.68 -X WHILE MAXIMIZING THE REPROJECTION ERROR OVER THE PREDICTED POSE
utt_0089 utt 355.06 358.07 -X NOW BECAUSE WE ARE USING WEIGHTED CORRESPONDENCES
utt_0090 utt 358.29 363.07 -X THESE TWO TERMS DRIVE THE WEIGHTS TO BE BOTH UNCERTAINTY-AWARE AND DISCRIMINATIVE
utt_0091 utt 363.54 368.95 -X BEING UNCERTAINTY-AWARE INDICATES THE INNER REGION WITH HIGHER CONFIDENCE SHALL BE WEIGHTED MORE
utt_0092 utt 369.08 381.02 -X AND BEING DISCRIMINATIVE MEANS THE POINTS SENSITIVE TO THE VARIATION OF POSE SHALL BE WEIGHTED MORE THIS BALANCE HELPS THE MODEL TO FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT REGIONS IN THE IMAGE
utt_0094 utt 381.34 383.45 -X SOMEHOW RESEMBLING THE ATTENTION MECHANISM
utt_0095 utt 384.18 389.34 -X THEREFORE, WE NO LONGER NEED TO CHERRY-PICK THE KEYPOINTS OR USE SEGMENTATION MASK
utt_0096 utt 391.03 392.88 -X NOW THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
utt_0097 utt 393.18 397.63 -X THE POSE DISTRIBUTION IS INTRACTABLE AND HAS TO BE APPROXIMATED NUMERICALLY
utt_0098 utt 398.14 409.79 -X A SIMPLE APPROACH IS LAPLACE APPROXIMATION THIS REQUIRES SOLVING THE OPTIMAL POSE COMPUTING THE LOCAL COVARIANCE MATRIX AND USING THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION AS AN APPROXIMATION.
utt_0102 utt 410.10 419.36 -X HOWEVER, THIS IS EFFECTIVELY A GENERALIZATION OF THE IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION METHOD BECAUSE WE ARE STILL BACKPROPAGATING THROUGH THE OPTIMAL POSE ùë¶‚àó
utt_0104 utt 420.06 423.95 -X AND IT CAN BE SEEN THAT NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FAILS TO CAPTURE OTHER MODES
utt_0105 utt 423.99 426.14 -X SO IT IS STILL INACCURATE
utt_0106 utt 427.32 436.06 -X THEREFORE, WE RESORT TO MONTE CARLO METHODS AND ADOPT THE ADAPTIVE MULTIPLE IMPORTANCE SAMPLING ALGORITHM TO DRAW WEIGHTED SAMPLES FROM THE DISTRIBUTION
utt_0109 utt 436.25 441.44 -X SO THAT THE SECOND TERM OF THE KL LOSS IS APPROXIMATED BY THE IMPORTANCE WEIGHTS
utt_0110 utt 443.55 449.13 -X NOW, TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE EPRO-PNP LAYER CAN IMPROVE EXISTING PNP-BASED NETWORKS
utt_0111 utt 450.11 453.57 -X WE TEST A sixDOF POSE ESTIMATION NETWORK BASED ON CDPN
utt_0112 utt 454.20 456.35 -X WHICH IS A DENSE CORRESPONDENCE METHOD
utt_0113 utt 457.66 467.09 -X WE REMOVE ITS TRANSLATION HEAD BECAUSE IT‚ÄôS BASED ON DEPTH REGRESSION AND KEEP ONLY THE COORDINATE BRANCH THAT PREDICTS DENSE threeD COORDINATES AND WEIGHTS VIA CNN
utt_0115 utt 467.42 470.78 -X AND WE ADD SOME MINOR MODIFICATIONS TO THE LAST LAYER
utt_0116 utt 472.19 479.52 -X THE EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT SIMPLY ADDING THE BASIC EPRO-PNP LOSS DURING TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE POSE ACCURACY
utt_0118 utt 479.83 484.22 -X AND WITH SOME TRAINING TRICKS IT IS ABLE TO COMPETE AGAINST THE STATE OF THE ART
utt_0119 utt 485.56 493.02 -X COMPARED TO THE OTHER METHODS EPRO-PNP RETAINS A SIMPLE AND ELEGANT ARCHITECTURE BASED SOLELY ON THE PNP SOLVER
utt_0121 utt 493.47 496.83 -X NO EXPLICIT DEPTH PREDICTION, NO POSE REFINER
utt_0122 utt 497.34 501.79 -X THIS MAKES OUR METHOD VERY FAST COMPARED TO SOME MORE COMPLICATED METHODS
utt_0123 utt 503.83 507.45 -X FURTHERMORE, WE EXPLORE THE FLEXIBILITY OF EPRO-PNP
utt_0124 utt 507.61 512.86 -X BY PROPOSING A NOVEL DEFORMABLE CORRESPONDENCE NETWORK FOR threeD OBJECT DETECTION
utt_0125 utt 513.18 516.45 -X WHICH FREES THE POINTS FROM A FIXED PATTERN
utt_0126 utt 516.67 522.40 -X IN THIS NETWORK, THE ENTIRE threeD, twoD COORDINATES AND WEIGHTS ARE LEARNED FROM SCRATCH
utt_0127 utt 523.04 528.77 -X MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE USE FCOSthreeD AS A BASE DETECTOR TO GENERATE OBJECT QUERIES
utt_0128 utt 529.08 533.57 -X WHICH ARE FED INTO THE DEFORMABLE SAMPLING LAYER INSPIRED BY DEFORMABLE DETR
utt_0129 utt 535.07 537.50 -X TO GENERATE twoDminus threeD CORRESPONDENCES
utt_0130 utt 537.60 546.08 -X WE FIRST PREDICT THE LOCATIONS OF THE twoD POINTS AND THEN EXTRACT THE POINT-WISE FEATURES BY INTERPOLATING THE DENSE FEATURE MAP
utt_0132 utt 546.49 549.47 -X AND FINALLY ADOPT A VERY SMALL POINT TRANSFORMER
utt_0133 utt 549.60 552.70 -X TO PREDICT THE threeD COORDINATES AND WEIGHTS OF EACH POINT
utt_0134 utt 553.50 562.46 -X ANOTHER OBJECT-LEVEL BRANCH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEALING WITH SOME EXTRA PREDICTIONS SUCH AS THE CONFIDENCE SCORE, AND THE SIZE OF THE threeD BOUNDING BOX
utt_0136 utt 564.22 568.08 -X THE RESULTING NETWORK NOT ONLY SURPASSES THE FCOSthreeD BASELINE
utt_0137 utt 568.19 582.11 -X BUT ALSO OUTPERFORMS THE STATE OF THE ART AT THE TIME OF SUBMISSION IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT NONE OF THESE COMPETITORS HAVE TRY THE PNP METHOD BEFORE SINCE END-TO-END TRAINING IS VERY IMPORTANT ON SUCH A LARGE DATASET
utt_0140 utt 582.11 584.45 -X THEREFORE, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT
utt_0141 utt 584.54 593.75 -X EPRO-PNP COMBINES THE BEST OF BOTH THE IMPLICIT AND THE EXPLICIT METHODS HERE ARE SOME OF THE VISUALIZATIONS
utt_0143 utt 599.36 602.05 -X IF YOU USE MONTE CARLO PNP AT TEST TIME
utt_0144 utt 602.08 605.89 -X YOU CAN EVEN DRAW THE PROBABILITY DENSITY OF OBJECT POSITION
utt_0145 utt 606.01 608.58 -X WHICH REFLECTS THE LOCALIZATION UNCERTAINTY
utt_0146 utt 609.89 617.28 -X ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE OF EPRO-PNP IS THAT IT NATURALLY HANDLES THE AMBIGUOUS ORIENTATION CASE
utt_0148 utt 617.57 620.32 -X BY PREDICTING A MULTI-MODAL DISTRIBUTION
utt_0149 utt 620.38 624.48 -X WHICH OCCURS UNDER SYMMETRICITY OR UNCERTAIN OBSERVATIONS
utt_0150 utt 626.94 640.29 -X FOR FUTURE WORK, IT IS PROMISING TO APPLY EPRO-PNP TO OTHER PNP-BASED POSE ESTIMATION NETWORKS INCLUDING SELF CAMERA LOCALIZATION OR WE CAN DESIGN NOVEL NETWORKS THAT LEVERAGES ITS FLEXIBILITY
utt_0153 utt 640.29 654.10 -X FOR EXAMPLE THE GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS DO NOT HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO POINT RELATIONSHIPS AND BEYOND POSE ESTIMATION WE HOPE IT CAN BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER LEARNING MODELS WITH NESTED OPTIMIZATION LAYERS
