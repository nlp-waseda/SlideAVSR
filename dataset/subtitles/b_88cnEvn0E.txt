utt_0000 utt 3.05 7.12 -X HELLO I AM HUSSEIN MOZANNAR AND IM GOING TO PRESENT RECENT WORK IN
utt_0001 utt 7.47 22.21 -X COLLABORATION WITH MY ADVISOR DAVID SONTAG ON CONSISTENT ESTIMATORS FOR THE LEARNING TO DEFER TO AN EXPERT PROBLEM. TO EXPLAIN THE PROBLEM WE ARE GOING TO TACKLE TODAY WE WILL TAKE AS EXAMPLE THE TASK OF DETECTING PNEUMONIA FROM JUST X-RAYS
utt_0004 utt 23.08 36.59 -X THIS TASK IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY TRAINED RADIOLOGISTS WHO ARE GIVEN A PATIENT'S X-RAY AND THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS WILL MAKE A DECISION WHETHER THIS PATIENT HAS PNEUMONIA OR NOT HOWEVER THE COLLECTION OF HUGE CHEST
utt_0007 utt 36.59 51.23 -X X-RAY DATA SETS LIKE CHEXPERT HAS ENABLED DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO PERFORM AS WELL AND BETTER THAN TRAINED RADIOLOGISTS AT DETECTING VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS FROM THESE X-RAYS HOWEVER THESE ALGORITHMS ARE ONLY GIVEN ACCESS
utt_0010 utt 51.23 62.19 -X TO THE X-RAY AND NOT OTHER HISTORICAL MEDICAL RECORDS. THE QUESTION IS NOW WE HAVE THESE REALLY GOOD MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS HOW DO WE INTEGRATE THEM INTO
utt_0012 utt 62.19 72.53 -X REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS SUCH THAT WE ACHIEVE BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN RELYING SOLELY ON THE EXPERT OR ONLY ON THE ALGORITHM AND IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE
utt_0014 utt 72.53 82.03 -X EASE THE BURDEN ON THE RADIOLOGIST WHOSE TIME IS COSTLY. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS TO LEARN A MODULE THAT GIVEN ONLY
utt_0016 utt 84.24 96.50 -X PATIENTS AND PUT THE X-RAY COMES THE DECISION TO EITHER THE EXPERT OR THE MODEL SO THAT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS PRAIRIE OR THE FURTHER MODULE SAYS TO
utt_0018 utt 96.50 108.27 -X DEFER DECISION TO THE EXPERT THEN THE EXPERT IS QUERIED AND MAKES THE FINAL DECISION ON THE OTHER HAND THE MODEL ALLOWS THE CLASSIFIER TO PREDICT THEN
utt_0020 utt 108.27 119.46 -X ONLY THE MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIER IS BURIED AND THE EXPERT IS NOT INVOLVED IN MAKING ANY OF THE DECISION REGARDLESS PATIENT THIS KIND OF INTERACTION BETWEEN
utt_0022 utt 119.46 129.11 -X ALGORITHM AND HUMAN EXPERT THROUGH DEFERRAL HAS ALREADY FOUND APPLICATIONS AND CONTENT MODERATION NOR WORK AIMS TO GIVE A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE
utt_0024 utt 129.11 142.80 -X APPLICATIONS IN HEALTH CARE FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS WORK WE FORMALIZED THE LEARNING TO THE FIRST THING AND PROPOSE A NOVEL CONSISTENT SURROGATE LAWS FOR THE COMBINED HUMAN AND EXPERT SYSTEM WHICH IS OBTAINED THROUGH A DEDUCTION TO
utt_0027 utt 142.80 153.97 -X COST-SENSITIVE LEARNING THIS LAW SETTLES AN OPEN PROBLEM BY ME AT ALL FOR FINDING AN ASSISTANT SURROGATE FOR MULTI-CLASS REJECTION LEARNING WE ANALYZE PREVIOUS
utt_0029 utt 153.97 163.03 -X APPROACH IN LITERATURE FROM A CONSISTENT PEOPLE POINT OF VIEW AND GIVE A GENERALIZATION BOUND FOR MINIMIZING THE EMPIRICAL OBJECTIVE FINALLY WE PROVIDE
utt_0031 utt 163.03 174.34 -X LETHAL EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF OUR METHOD ON VARIOUS TASKS THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TRACKING MORE AND MORE ATTENTION RECENTLY IN two thousand and eighteen MADRAS FL PROPOSED A
utt_0033 utt 174.34 187.89 -X MIXTURE OF EXPERTS LAWS HOWEVER THE RESULTING LOSS IS NOT CONSISTENT AND FAILS EMPIRICALLY RAHU ED TODD PROPOSED A CONFIDENCE SCORE APPROACH THAT COMPARES EXPERT AND ALGORITHM CONFIDENCE HOWEVER THIS APPROACH DOES NOT ALLOW THE
utt_0036 utt 187.89 201.78 -X CLASSIFIER TO ADAPT TO THE EXPERT WEAKNESSES AND STRENGTHS EVEN MORE RECENTLY THE ETHEL GAVE AN APPROXIMATE ALGORITHM FOR RICH REGRESSION AND WHETHER IT WELCOME POINT COMBINE THE MIXTURE OF EXPERT LOSS WITH THE
utt_0039 utt 201.78 212.69 -X CONFIDENCE SCORE COMPARISON THIS PROBLEM IS ALSO A GENERALIZATION OF SELECTIVE CLASSIFICATION AND LEARNING WITH A REJECT OPTION SO LET US START BY
utt_0041 utt 212.69 217.08 -X FORMALIZING OUR PROBLEM AFRICA VERY SPACE X AND THE LABEL SPACE Y WE WANT
utt_0042 utt 217.68 222.74 -X DURING A REJECTER R OF X THAT IS WHAT WE WILL FILL TO IS ALREADY FERRELL MODULE
utt_0043 utt 222.80 234.95 -X THAT WILL DECIDE WITH THE TWO ROUTES IN TWITTER CLASSIFIER IF THE OUTPUT OF THE EJECTOR IS ZERO IF THE DECISION IS TO ROUTE TO THEIR CLASSIFIER CLASSIFIER
utt_0045 utt 234.95 247.88 -X PREDICTS H OF X AND WE COULDN'T ALGORITHM LOSS L IT DEPENDS ON THE KAVERI X LABELED Y AND I'LL GIVE A PREDICTION H OF X ON THE OTHER HAND THE
utt_0047 utt 247.88 262.26 -X REJECTED DEFERS BY OUTPUTTING one THEN THE EXPERT IS FIRST GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL CONTEXT SHE INSIST X FOR EXAMPLE THE DECISION CONTEXT CONTAIN THE MEDICAL RECORDS IN ADDITION TO THE X-RAY JUST SYMBOLIZED BY X
utt_0050 utt 262.77 274.29 -X THE EXPERT PREDICTS M OF Z AND AS A WHOLE IN THE SYSTEM WE INCURRED AN EXPERT LOSS THAT DEPENDS ON THE VARIED X LABEL Y AN ACTUAL EXPERT ADDICTION AND
utt_0052 utt 275.51 288.06 -X OF Z OUR GOAL IS JOINTLY LEARN THE CLASSIFIER H OF X AND REJECTER R OF X TO MINIMIZE THE COMBINED SYSTEM LOSS WHICH IS THE CLASSIFIER COST IF WE PREDICT AND
utt_0054 utt 288.06 298.87 -X THE EXPERT COST IF WE DEFER THE INSIGHT OR APPROACH FOR THIS PROBLEM IS FROM REDUCTION TO COST-SENSITIVE LEARNING IN COST-SENSITIVE LEARNING WE ARE GIVEN A
utt_0056 utt 298.87 310.14 -X COVARIANCE THE COVARIATE AND THE COLLECTOR OF COST C OF DIMENSION THE NUMBER OF CLASSES K PLUS one AND THE GOAL IS TO PICK THE CLASS AMONG THE one UP TO K
utt_0058 utt 310.14 321.27 -X PLUS one THAT HAS THE LEAST COST C one UP TO CK PLUS one SO THE REDUCTION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY TAKING THE FIRST STATE CLASSES TO SIGNIFY THE LABEL SPACE Y AND
utt_0060 utt 322.04 333.62 -X THE COST FOR THESE K CLASSES IS THE COST OF THE ALGORITHM PREDICTING EACH ONE OF THESE CLASSES DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL CORPORATE X AND LABELED Y AND THE COST
utt_0062 utt 333.62 340.25 -X FOR THE CLASS KI PLUS one IS NOW THE CLASS OF DEFERRING TO THE EXPERT ALL OF X THAT
utt_0063 utt 340.44 351.29 -X INITIALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXPERT PREDICTION OF Z SO THIS IS DOCTRINE MEANS IF WE PREDICT ANY OF THE FIRST STAGE ASSETS IT MEANS THE CLASSIFIER HAS
utt_0065 utt 351.29 362.07 -X FAITH OR BIT AND IF YOU PREDICT THE K PLUS one CLASS IT MEANS WE ARE THE one3TH DECISION TO THE EXPERT AND OCCURRED THE EXPERT LOSS SO HOW DO WE SOLVE
utt_0067 utt 362.07 372.31 -X DISCUSSING THE PROCESS OF LEARNING PROBLEM WELL CONSISTS OF LEARNING AS REALIZATION OF MULTI CLASS LEARNING AND WE USE THIS USUAL STRATEGY OF FINDING AN
utt_0069 utt 372.31 381.37 -X EASILY OPTIMIZABLE SURROGATE LOSS FOR THE TRUE OBJECTIVE WE PROPOSED A NATURAL EXTENSION OF THE CROSS CEMENTERY LOSS WITH THE SETTING
utt_0071 utt 381.69 387.42 -X WE'RE GOING TO LEARN K PLUS one FUNCTIONS G SUBSCRIPT I FOR I AND Q PLUS one AND
utt_0072 utt 387.64 391.48 -X THEIR CLASSIFIER H OF X IS GOING TO PICK THE MAXIMUM OF THESE
utt_0073 utt 393.33 406.20 -X OUR SURROGATE LAWS THAT WE INTRODUCE IS CALLED TILDE A C AND IT IS THE SUM OF THE NEGATIVE LOG SOFTMAX OF EACH GI WEIGHTED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
utt_0075 utt 406.20 411.93 -X MAXIMAL COST AMONG ALL KILLZONE CLASSES AND THE COST FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS GI
utt_0076 utt 412.95 425.43 -X THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAXIMUM IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL TERMS AND THIS LOSS ARE POSITIVE AND WE MINIMIZE SOMETHING THAT IS CONVEX WE HAVE THAT THIS LOSS TO
utt_0078 utt 425.43 430.23 -X THE FC IS A CONSISTENT LOSS FUNCTION WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF WE MINIMIZE
utt_0079 utt 430.29 442.68 -X THIS LOSS OVER ALL MEASURABLE FUNCTIONS G THE MINIMIZER THAT WE OBTAIN WILL PICK THE CLASS THAT HAS THE LEAST EXPECTED COST GIVEN THE COVARIATE X MEANING WE
utt_0081 utt 442.68 455.80 -X PICK THE CLASS MINIMIZES THE EXPECTATION OF C OF Y GIVEN X SO LET US RETURN TO OUR LEIFER LISTENING WE WILL ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE DATA OVER TARGET WHY COVER IT X
utt_0083 utt 456.25 465.18 -X AS WELL AS EXPERT ADDICTIONS AND M OF I FOR EACH SAMPLE IN OUR DATA SET WE MAKE
utt_0084 utt 465.21 475.08 -X THE CENTRALIZATION OF CLASSIFIER AND EXPERT COST AS THE MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR OF THE TARGET THE OBJECTIVE IS TO LEARN A CLASSIFIER AND THE REJECTOR
utt_0086 utt 475.08 484.89 -X NORTH ACHIEVE THE SMALLEST YEAR WONDER FOR THE COMBINED SYSTEM THIS IS DENOTED THAN THE LOSS AT zero OF one WHICH IS SIMPLY THE MISCLASSIFICATION ERROR OF THE
utt_0088 utt 484.89 498.11 -X COMBINED SYSTEM AS USUAL WE WILL LEARN Y CAPITAL Y FUNCTIONS FOR EACH LABEL IN OUR LABEL SPACE G SUBSCRIPT Y AND OUR CLASSIFIER IS GOING TO PICK THE MAXIMUM
utt_0090 utt 498.11 512.38 -X AMONG THESE CAPITAL Y FUNCTIONS SIMILARLY WE ALSO LEARN AN ADDITIONAL FUNCTION G SUBSCRIPT D AND WE DEFINE OUR REJECTER BY BY BEING ONE OF G SUBSCRIPT
utt_0092 utt 512.38 522.84 -X D IS BIGGER THAN THE MAXIMUM AMONG ALL OF THE REST OF THE Y FUNCTION THIS IS TO MAKE THINGS AS A MULTI-CLASS PROBLEM THAT IS AUGMENTED WITH THE ADDITIONAL
utt_0094 utt 522.84 528.96 -X CLASS OF THE PHARAOH AND NOW THE CIRCUIT PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED FOOD AS HE BECOMES
utt_0095 utt 529.21 540.70 -X THE LOST I SEE AND THIS MADE OF OF TWO TERMS THE FIRST TERM MAKE SURE THAT THE CLASSIFIED FITS THE TARGET THIS IS READING THE COVER ROSE AND APPEAR CHORUS
utt_0097 utt 540.70 545.31 -X AND TRIPLE O'S HOWEVER WHEN NORMALIZING BY THE ADDITIONAL FUNCTION JESUS FRUITY
utt_0098 utt 546.04 552.16 -X THE SECOND TERM ONLY APPEARS ON EXAMPLES WERE THE EXPERT IS CORRECT WHEN M
utt_0099 utt 552.79 565.02 -X SUBSCRIPT I IS EQUAL TO Y SUBSCRIPT I AND THIS TERM ENCOURAGES THE SYSTEM TO DEFER TO THE EXPERT INSTEAD OF PREDICTING THE TARGET SOWN THESE SET SET
utt_0101 utt 565.02 579.66 -X OF EXAMPLES THEY HAVE AN EQUAL COST FOR DIFFERENT OR PARTICULAR TARGET AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PREVIOUS PROPOSITION WE HAVE THAT THIS LOSS IS A CONSISTENT ESTIMATOR FOR THE zero one LOSS AND FURTHERMORE WE GET IS A CONVEX UPPER
utt_0104 utt 579.66 592.86 -X BOUND WHICH IS REASSURING SO AS I JUST MENTIONED THIS LOSS LCE HAS AN EQUAL COST FOR DEFERRING OR DRINKING TARGET ON EXAMPLES WITH EXPERTISE CORRECT WHICH
utt_0106 utt 592.86 603.65 -X FOUND AS A HEURISTIC IT IS HELPFUL TO ITS RISK ENCOURAGED OR DISCOURAGED ACTION OF DEFERRAL BY ADDING DEVIATING PARAMETER ALPHA THIS PARENT COULD ALPHA
utt_0108 utt 603.65 615.15 -X ONLY APPEARS ON EXAMPLES WERE THE EXPERT IS CORRECT IF THE EXPERT IS CORRECT WEARY WEIGHT THE CLASSIFIER LOSS THIS IS THE FIRST TERM OF THE LOSS BY ALPHA AND
utt_0110 utt 615.58 626.53 -X IF NOT WE WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PREDICTING TARGETS THE REFERRAL SO ONE CAN THINK IF ALPHA IS ZERO ON EXAMPLES WHERE THE EXPERT IS CORRECT OUR ONLY
utt_0112 utt 626.53 639.26 -X CHOICE IS TO DEFER AND IF AND IF THE EXPERT IS NOT CORRECT THEN WE HAVE TO BE PREDICTING TARGET MOVING ON TO EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION WILL PREVENT
utt_0114 utt 639.26 642.53 -X PREVENT PRESENT AN ASSERTIVE EXPERIMENT USING
utt_0115 utt 642.65 654.53 -X THE Cminus four DATASET WE WILL BE CLASSIFYING SYSTEM ADJACENT TO TEN CLASSES AND PARAMETERIZE OUR MODEL G AND THE Y RESNET WOULD eleven OUTPUT LAYERS THE FIRST
utt_0117 utt 654.53 659.17 -X THEN OUR G SUBSCRIPT Y AND THE elevenTH UNIT IS FOR DEFERRAL
utt_0118 utt 659.32 671.49 -X OF TRADING WE SIMULATE MULTIPLE SYNTHETIC EXPERTS AS FOLLOWS THAT GAVE THAT KB AN INTEGER AND ONE TO TEN THEN IF THE IMAGE BE LAUNCHED WITH FIRST K
utt_0120 utt 671.49 685.60 -X CLASSES THE EXPERT IS PERFECT OTHERWISE THE EXCERPTED X UNIFORMLY AT RANDOM SO WE HAVE A CLEAN REGION OF EXPERTISE FOR THE EXPERT THIS IS THE FIRST K CLASSES WE COMPARE APPROACH TO THREE BASELINES THE FIRST IS THE MIXTURE
utt_0123 utt 685.60 696.55 -X OF EXPERT BASELINE OF MOTHERS AT ALL THE SECOND IS THE CONFLUENCE APPROACH OF RABBU AT ALL AND THE THIRD BASELINE WITH ITS REGIONAL LEARNED ORACLE TRIES TO
utt_0125 utt 696.55 707.68 -X CAPTURE IT INTUITIVE BEHAVIOR IN THE SETTING WE SHOULD BE DEFERRING TO THE EXPERT ON THE FIRST K CLASSES AND PREDICTING UNDER TEN MONTHS REMAINING
utt_0127 utt 707.68 720.26 -X TEN NIGHTS K CLASSES AND THIS BASELINE TRIES TO DO EXACTLY THAT WITH THE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE OF T SO ON THE LEFT YOU'RE SHOWING A PLOT OF COMBINED SYSTEM
utt_0129 utt 720.26 732.64 -X ACCURACY ON THE Y-AXIS VERSUS K THE NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT CAN PREDICT SO EACH POINT HERE CORRESPONDS TO A PARTICULAR EXPERT GAME AS WE CAN SEE THE
utt_0131 utt 732.64 744.23 -X MIXTURE OF EXPERT LAWSON AND LEARNED ORACLE APPROACH IN THE MIXTURE OF EXPERT LOSS FIRST PHASE LEARN ANY BEHAVIOR FOR UP TO K EQUAL TO SEVEN IT LEARNS TO
utt_0133 utt 744.23 758.02 -X NEVER DEFER TO THE EXPERT THE EARNED ORACLE PERFORMS A BIT BETTER ON HIGHER K BUT FAILS INITIALLY NOW THE CONFIDENCE COVER APPROACH AND BLUE AQUA FROM THESE
utt_0135 utt 758.02 772.11 -X TWO BASELINES AND GIVES A CONSISTENT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR NOW WE ARE SHOWING OUR APPROACH FOR TWO DIFFERENT ALPHAS zero point five AND one AND RED AND BLUE RESPECTIVE AND
utt_0137 utt 772.11 784.58 -X AIR THAN BLACK RESPECTIVELY AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR METHOD DOMINATES ALL OF THE BASELINES ACROSS ALL VALUES OF K AND THIS GAINS ARE BY one TO two ON AVERAGE FOR
utt_0139 utt 784.58 796.90 -X CONFIDENCE AND two TO three ON AVERAGE FOR LEARNED ORACLE TO GAIN MORE INSIGHT INTO THE BEHAVIOR OF OUR METHOD WE PLOT ON THE RIGHT THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFIER
utt_0141 utt 796.90 806.37 -X ARE NONDIFFERENT EXAMPLES VERSUS THE COVERAGE WE CAN SEE THAT OUR METHOD NOT ONLY GETS HIGHER COVERAGE MEANING WE ARE PREDICTING A HIGHER PERCENT OF THE TIME
utt_0143 utt 806.37 818.32 -X BUT YOU ALSO HAVE A HIGHER ACCURACY WHEN WE DO ACTUALLY PREDICT SO GIVING THE RESULTS WHILE WE OUTPERFORM THE BASELINES THE FIRST REASON IS THAT OF
utt_0145 utt 818.32 833.25 -X SAMPLE COMPLEXITY IN THE FIGURE ON THE RIGHT WE ARE PLOTTING WITH THE X-AXIS THE TRAINING DATASET SIZE AND ON THE Y-AXIS DEMOCRACY AS WE RESTRICT THE TRAINING DATES AT SIZE OUR GAINS OVER THE CONFIDENCE BASELINE IMPROVE BY A
utt_0148 utt 833.25 847.72 -X FACTOR OF THREE AND FOUR THE SECOND REASON IS THAT OUR METHOD TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CLASSIFIER CONFIDENCE THEIR OWN ORACLE BASED ON DOES NOT LOOK AT THE CONFERENCE OF THE CLASSIFIER AND HENCE SUFFERS FINALLY THE THIRD REASON IS THAT
utt_0151 utt 847.72 858.81 -X OF CONSISTENCY THE MIXTURE OF EXPERT BASED ON IS NOT CONSISTENT THERE IS A CLEAR MISMATCH BETWEEN THE LOSS AND THE ACTUAL ERROR OF THE SYSTEM FURTHER
utt_0153 utt 858.81 867.70 -X EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF OUR METHOD IS AVAILABLE NOW PAPER WE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS ON CHEST X-RAY THE SET CONTENT MOTIVATION OF BEADS AND
utt_0155 utt 868.32 878.25 -X FURTHER RESULTS ON Cfour one hundred THIS METHOD HAS ALSO BEEN EMPLOYED IN URINE ATTRACTIVE ACTION IN OUR IN A RECENT PAPER FROM OUR LAB IN KV two thousand and twenty WE ALSO
utt_0157 utt 879.27 890.66 -X HAVE FURTHER RESULTS FOR INHALATION BOUNDS FOR THE zero one LOSS OBJECTIVE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN OUR WORK PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT US AND READ OUT THANK YOU AGAIN
