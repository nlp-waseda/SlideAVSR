utt_0000 utt 0.56 5.97 -X WE INTRODUCE REVISIT, LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD OF INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION STUDIES.
utt_0001 utt 6.89 12.66 -X IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT WELL DESIGNED INTERACTIONS CAN IMPROVE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE USE DATA VISUALIZATIONS.
utt_0002 utt 13.23 18.26 -X BUT, HOW DO WE ASSESS THE IMPACT THAT INTERACTIONS HAVE ON PERFORMING VISUAL ANALYSIS?
utt_0003 utt 19.31 26.77 -X FOR VISUALIZATIONS WITH FEW INTERACTIONS, DATA ANALYSTS CAN DESIGN THE STUDY TO CONTROL FOR THE EFFECT OF EACH ONE.
utt_0005 utt 26.77 32.66 -X THIS CAN BE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW EACH INTERACTION AFFECTS A USER'S ACCURACY OR SPEED WHEN COMPLETING A TASK.
utt_0007 utt 33.49 41.59 -X HOWEVER, FOR MORE COMPLEX INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS, IT BECOMES HARDER TO CONTROL FOR ALL POSSIBLE FORMS OF INTERACTIONS.
utt_0009 utt 41.59 46.07 -X ADDITIONALLY, PARTICIPANTS CAN USE DIFFERENT ANALYSIS STRATEGIES, OR SEQUENCES OF INTERACTIONS,
utt_0010 utt 46.07 47.38 -X TO SOLVE A GIVEN TASK.
utt_0011 utt 48.15 55.83 -X THIS LEADS TO THE QUESTION, HOW DO ANALYSIS STRATEGIES IMPACT PARTICIPANT PERFORMANCE WHEN USING INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATIONS?
utt_0013 utt 56.76 65.56 -X TO ADDRESS THIS, WE PROPOSE A NEW STUDY WORKFLOW THAT ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT INTERACTION STRATEGIES HAVE ON USER PERFORMANCE.
utt_0015 utt 66.29 71.83 -X WE IMPLEMENT THE DATA ANALYSIS METHODS IN THIS WORKFLOW IN AN OPEN SOURCED WEB-BASED TOOL, REVISIT
utt_0017 utt 72.44 82.72 -X REVISIT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR ANALYSIS OF BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESULTS, AS WELL AS PROVENANCE VISUALIZATION THROUGH EVENT SEQUENCE MINING AND PLAYBACK OF PARTICIPANTS SESSIONS.
utt_0020 utt 83.90 87.23 -X LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT REVISIT IN ACTION.
utt_0021 utt 87.55 93.34 -X HEATHER IS A RESEARCHER WHO RECENTLY RAN A USER STUDY ANALYZING THE PERFORMANCE OF NETWORK VISUALIZATIONS.
utt_0023 utt 93.34 99.23 -X HER STUDY COMPARES NODE LINK DIAGRAMS TO ADJACENCY MATRICES FOR FINDING PATHS IN A NETWORK.
utt_0024 utt 99.42 107.46 -X DURING HER STUDY DESIGN, HEATHER HAD TO BALANCE THE INTERACTIONS AVAILABLE BETWEEN BOTH NODE LINK AND MATRICES TO NOT UNDULY FAVOR ONE CONDITION OVER THE OTHER.
utt_0026 utt 107.68 113.38 -X AN IMPORTANT PART OF FINDING A PATH IN A NETWORK IS BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY NEIGHBORING NODES.
utt_0027 utt 113.38 117.12 -X IN THE NODE LINK, THIS CAN BE EASILY BE DONE BY CLICKING ON A NODE TO HIGHLIGHT NEIGHBORS.
utt_0028 utt 117.28 125.83 -X IN THE ADJACENCY MATRIX, HEATHER ADDED AN INTERACTION THAT HIGHLIGHTED NEIGHBORS IN GREEN WHEN A USER CLICKS THE COLUMN LABEL.
utt_0030 utt 126.82 134.98 -X NOW, SHE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THIS ADDED INTERACTION ACTUALLY HELPED IMPROVE PERFORMANCE FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX.
utt_0032 utt 134.98 138.08 -X HEATHER MOVES OVER TO THE REVISIT SYSTEM, IN THE HOME PAGE.
utt_0033 utt 138.18 146.98 -X HERE SHE CAN SEE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF HOW HER PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED ON EACH OF HER TASKS, AS WELL AS THE MEAN INTERACTION PATTERNS USED IN THOSE TASKS.
utt_0035 utt 147.36 149.35 -X HOVERING OVER THE INTERACTION PATTERNS
utt_0036 utt 149.38 157.06 -X SHE NOTICES THAT USERS WHO USE THE COLUMN LABEL INTERACTION PERFORMED AT AROUND seventy% ACCURACY
utt_0038 utt 158.28 161.00 -X COMPARED TO THE sixty% ACCURACY WITHOUT
utt_0039 utt 161.99 165.03 -X SHE WANTS TO DRILL DOWN INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE.
utt_0040 utt 165.16 170.38 -X SO SHE GOES OVER TO THE TASK ANALYSIS PANE, AND THEN FIRST GROUPS ON CONDITION.
utt_0041 utt 171.14 178.03 -X THEN SHE WANTS TO GROUP UPON WHETHER OR NOT A USER USED THE COLUMN LABEL ITSELF.
utt_0042 utt 179.50 181.87 -X GROUPING ON THAT AND EXPANDING THE COLUMNS,
utt_0043 utt 181.87 186.92 -X SHE CAN SEE THAT USERS OF THE COLUMN LABEL INTERACTION
utt_0044 utt 188.23 189.58 -X HAVE A sixty-seven% ACCURACY
utt_0045 utt 189.80 192.29 -X COMPARED TO A forty-five% ACCURACY FOR THE PARTICIPANTS
utt_0046 utt 194.86 197.33 -X HOW DID NOT USE THE COLUMN LABEL TECHNIQUE.
utt_0047 utt 197.93 211.90 -X HAVING VALIDATED THAT THERE EXISTS A PRETTY LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACCURACIES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO USED THE COLUMN LABEL AND DON'T, SHE WANTED TO DRILL DOWN INTO EXACTLY HOW THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T USE THE COLUMN LABEL
utt_0050 utt 211.90 214.26 -X GO ABOUT SOLVING THIS TASK FOR THE ADJACENCY MATRIX.
utt_0051 utt 215.05 218.07 -X AS SHE IS INTERESTED IN THE ANSWERS THAT THEY GAVE AS WELL
utt_0052 utt 218.09 220.37 -X SHE GOES UNHIDES THAT COLUMN
utt_0053 utt 220.49 225.67 -X AND THEN SCROLLS DOWN TO LOOK AT HOW THE INDIVIDUALS WHO DIDN'T USE THE COLUMN LABEL
utt_0054 utt 225.68 227.19 -X APPROACH THIS TASK.
utt_0055 utt 227.95 233.49 -X AS SHE SCROLLS DOWN, SHE SEES A FAIR AMOUNT OF THESE ANSWERS, OF MVIEWS.
utt_0056 utt 234.19 244.53 -X AS THIS IS AN INCORRECT ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM, SHE DELVES INTO THE PLAYBACK INTERACTION TO SEE HOW USERS ARE USING THIS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
utt_0058 utt 245.11 250.36 -X PLAYING THROUGH EACH OF THE STRATEGIES SHE SEES THAT THE USERS SEARCH AND THEN SELECT
utt_0059 utt 251.79 256.82 -X FOR MVIEWS, WHICH IS LOCATED RIGHT IN BETWEEN LANE AND ROB.
utt_0060 utt 258.52 273.02 -X INTERESTED BY THIS, SHE SEES THAT LIKELY WHAT IS OCCURRING IS USERS ARE LOOKING DIRECTLY IN BETWEEN LANE AND ROB IN SELECTING THE NODE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN THEM THAT IS AN INSTITUTION,
utt_0062 utt 273.02 274.65 -X WHICH CORRESPONDS TO MVIEWS.
utt_0063 utt 274.90 277.75 -X THIS REPRESENTS A CONCEPTUAL MISUNDERSTANDING
utt_0064 utt 277.81 283.07 -X OF HOW EDGES ARE VISUALIZED INSIDE OF AN ADJACENCY MATRIX
utt_0065 utt 284.38 289.24 -X THIS METHODOLOGY WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE DATA FROM TWO PUBLISHED CROWDSOURCED USER STUDIES,
utt_0066 utt 289.24 291.61 -X WHICH WE PRESENT AS CASE STUDIES IN THE PAPER.
utt_0067 utt 291.96 302.61 -X THE COMBINED ANALYSIS OF STUDY RESULTS WITH THE INTERACTION PATTERNS HELPED OUR ANALYSTS UNCOVER NOVEL INTERACTION STRATEGIES, IDENTIFY GAPS IN PARTICIPANT TRAINING
utt_0069 utt 302.81 307.04 -X AND MEASURE THE IMPACT OF DESIGN DECISIONS USED IN THE STUDY.
