utt_0000 utt 1.10 5.52 -X HI EVERYONE, MY NAME IS ALASDAIR AND TODAY I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A TOUR OF ATTENTIONFLOW,
utt_0001 utt 5.55 14.03 -X A DEMO THAT CAN VISUALIZE A NETWORK TIME SERIES. THIS WORK IS DONE BY MY COLLEAGUES AND I AT THE COMPUTATIONAL MEDIA LAB AT THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY.
utt_0003 utt 14.51 24.53 -X IN THIS DEMO, WE ARE INTERESTED IN VISUALIZING HOW INFLUENCE PROPAGATES IN A NETWORK OF TIME SERIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE'RE GOING TO VISUALIZE TWO REAL-WORLD DATASETS:
utt_0005 utt 24.59 29.43 -X THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK ON YOUTUBE, AND THE HYPERLINK NETWORK ON WIKIPEDIA.
utt_0006 utt 30.99 39.64 -X SO LET ME JUST FOCUS ON THE YOUTUBE NETWORK. IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE, WE CAN SEE THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK CENTERED AROUND THE MUSIC VIDEO ROLLING IN THE DEEP BY ADELE.
utt_0008 utt 39.83 50.97 -X WE CALL THIS NODE HERE THE EGO NODE. NOW ALL THE OTHER NODES ON THIS PAGE ARE CONNECTED TO THE EGO NODE, MEANING THAT THERE'S TRAFFIC FLOWING FROM THE NEIGHBORING NODES TO THE EGO NODE. AND THESE
utt_0010 utt 50.97 61.46 -X EDGES ARE DETERMINED BY YOUTUBE'S RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHM. SO WHEN WE CONSTRUCTED THIS DATA SET WE ADDED AN EDGE FROM, LET'S SAY, COUNTING STARS TO ROLLING IN THE DEEP BECAUSE ROLLING IN THE
utt_0012 utt 61.46 66.42 -X DEEP APPEARS ON THE RECOMMENDATION SIDEBAR ON THE YOUTUBE PAGE OF COUNTING STARS.
utt_0013 utt 67.83 72.60 -X IN ADDITION, THE THICKNESS OF AN EDGE CORRESPONDS TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC,
utt_0014 utt 72.60 77.15 -X OR THE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE, FLOWING FROM A NEIGHBORING NODE TO THE EGO NODE.
utt_0015 utt 77.43 86.59 -X HERE WE CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC GOING FROM SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO ROLLING IN THE DEEP BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TRAFFIC GOING FROM COUNTING STARSTO ROLLING IN THE DEEP.
utt_0017 utt 86.90 91.00 -X IF WE HOVER OVER A NODE, WE CAN SEE AN ACTUAL ESTIMATE OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW.
utt_0019 utt 96.91 102.14 -X DEEP AFTER THEY HAD WATCHED SOMEONE LIKE YOU. THESE ESTIMATES, BY THE WAY,
utt_0020 utt 102.14 106.85 -X ARE NOT PROVIDED BY YOUTUBE, BUT THEY COME FROM A REGRESSION MODEL FROM PRIOR WORK IN OUR LAB,
utt_0021 utt 106.85 112.45 -X SO PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR PAPER IF YOU ARE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THESE NUMBERS CAME ABOUT.
utt_0023 utt 116.18 118.56 -X AND EACH EDGE IN THIS NETWORK MEANS.
utt_0024 utt 119.64 125.25 -X LET ME NEXT TALK ABOUT HOW TO VISUALIZE THE ACTUAL TIME SERIES. SO ON THE TOP PANEL,
utt_0025 utt 125.28 131.49 -X WE CAN SEE THE BLUE LINE CHART SHOWING THE DAILY TRAFFIC OF THE EGO NODE. IN ADDITION,
utt_0026 utt 131.49 136.96 -X WE ALSO OFFER A TREE RING REPRESENTATION OF THE SAME TIME SERIES INSIDE EACH NODE.
utt_0027 utt 137.41 145.09 -X THIS IS A MORE COARSE-GRAINED VIEW OF THE TIME SERIES AND IT ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY COMPARE THE EVOLUTION OF MANY TIME SERIES AT THE SAME TIME.
utt_0029 utt 145.86 149.67 -X SPECIFICALLY INSIDE EACH NODE, WE CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY RINGS,
utt_0030 utt 149.67 154.53 -X EACH OF WHICH HAS A DIFFERENT COLOR. EACH RING CORRESPONDS TO A PARTICULAR YEAR,
utt_0031 utt 154.53 160.52 -X AND THE SIZE OF EACH RING CORRESPONDS TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ACCUMULATED IN THAT YEAR.
utt_0032 utt 160.77 163.46 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE LOOK AT THE TREE RING FOR HELLO,
utt_0033 utt 163.46 169.70 -X WE CAN SEE THAT THE VIDEO GETS MOST OF ITS TRAFFIC IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS, AS INDICATED BY HOW
utt_0034 utt 170.08 177.19 -X MOST OF THE AREA IS OCCUPIED BY THE TWO INNERMOST RINGS. IN CONTRAST, FOR COUNTING STARS,
utt_0035 utt 177.19 181.06 -X THE TRAFFIC IS FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE YEARS.
utt_0036 utt 182.53 193.71 -X FINALLY ON THE TOP PANEL, WE ALSO MARK EXTERNAL EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE TRAFFIC. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE HOVER OVER THE FIRST PEAK HERE, WE CAN SEE THAT THAT PEAK
utt_0038 utt 193.71 199.79 -X COINCIDES WITH THE GRAMMY AWARDS IN two thousand and twelve, DURING WHICH ADELE RECEIVED THREE GRAMMYS.
utt_0039 utt 199.79 205.10 -X AND THAT WAS THE EXTERNAL EVENT THAT LED PEOPLE TO GO TO YOUTUBE AND LISTEN TO ROLLING IN THE DEEP.
utt_0040 utt 205.10 211.18 -X NOW YOU MIGHT WONDER, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SURGE IN TRAFFIC AROUND THE END OF two thousand and fifteen.
utt_0041 utt 212.36 224.65 -X WELL, IF WE HOVER OVER HELLO, WE CAN SEE THAT THAT SURGE COINCIDES WITH THE RELEASE OF THE SONG HELLO. THIS, COUPLED WITH A VERY THICK EDGE FROM HELLO TO ROLLING IN THE DEEP, INDICATES
utt_0043 utt 224.65 230.03 -X THAT WHEN HELLO WAS RELEASED, PEOPLE STARTED TO BECOME INTERESTED AGAIN IN ADELE'S OTHER SONGS.
utt_0044 utt 230.96 241.17 -X ON THE LEFT, WE ALSO PROVIDE SOME METADATA, LIKE THE ACTUAL MUSIC VIDEO THAT YOU CAN PLAY AND TWO WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE THE VISUALIZATION OF THE NETWORK. ONE OF THEM IS THE INFLUENCE
utt_0046 utt 241.17 246.39 -X SLIDER THAT CAN FILTER OUT NODES THAT HAVE AN INFLUENCE LESS THAN THE CHOSEN THRESHOLD.
utt_0047 utt 246.61 252.40 -X SO AS WE INCREASE THE THRESHOLD, THE LESS INFLUENTIAL NEIGHBORS WILL BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR.
utt_0048 utt 252.40 260.50 -X AND THE DROP DOWN MENU PROVIDES US WITH FIVE DIFFERENT SORTING CRITERIA ALONG THE Y-AXIS.
utt_0049 utt 260.85 274.81 -X BY DEFAULT, THE NODES ARE SORTED ACCORDING TO A FORCE-DIRECTED ALGORITHM WHICH TRIES TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CROSSING EDGES. BUT WE CAN ALSO SORT THE VIDEOS BY THE TOTAL VIEW COUNTS, WHERE THE MOST POPULAR VIDEOS ARE PLACED AT THE TOP.
utt_0052 utt 276.91 287.70 -X FINALLY WE HAVE A TIME SLIDER THAT ALLOWS US TO PROGRESSIVELY REVEAL A NEIGHBOR WHEN IT STARTS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE EGO NODE.
utt_0054 utt 287.70 291.61 -X SO THAT WAS A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF HOW ATTENTION FLOW CAN HELP US
utt_0055 utt 291.76 302.04 -X SEE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INFLUENCE ON THE TRAFFIC OF ROLLING IN THE DEEP. YOU CAN CLICK ON THE OTHER NODES OR YOU CAN USE THE SEARCH BAR TO VISUALIZE NETWORKS OF OTHER SONGS.
utt_0057 utt 305.59 319.74 -X IN ADDITION, YOU CAN ALSO GO TO THE VEVO ARTISTS PAGE TO SEE THE INFLUENCE NETWORKS OF ARTISTS ON YOUTUBE. OR YOU CAN GO TO THE WIKI TRAFFIC PAGE TO SEE THE INFLUENCE NETWORKS OF WIKIPEDIA PAGES,
utt_0059 utt 321.43 331.16 -X OUR DEMO IS LIVE AT ATTENTIONFLOW.ML. PLEASE ALSO CHECK OUT OUR PAPER AND WE ALSO PROVIDE SOURCE CODE FOR OUR DEMO ON GITHUB. THANKS!
