utt_0001 utt 1.58 2.77 -X WELCOME TO MY TALK.
utt_0002 utt 2.83 8.27 -X MY NAME IS GUANGKE CHEN, FROM SHANGHAITECH UNIVERSITY IN SHANGHAI, CHINA.
utt_0003 utt 8.27 11.57 -X TODAY I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR PAPER WHO IS REAL BOB?
utt_0004 utt 11.57 14.64 -X ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.
utt_0005 utt 14.92 23.50 -X IT IS A JOINT WORK WITH SEN CHEN, LINGLING FAN, XIAONING DU, ZHE ZHAO, FU SONG AND YANG LIU.
utt_0006 utt 23.63 31.41 -X AS THE TITLE OF OUR PAPER IMPLIES, THE TOPIC OF OUR PAPER IS ADVERSARIAL ATTACKS ON SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.
utt_0008 utt 31.76 36.91 -X SO FIRST LET ME BRIEFLY INTRODUCE THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF SPEAKER RECOGNITION.
utt_0009 utt 38.83 46.13 -X SPEAKER RECOGNITION IS AN AUTOMATIC TECHNIQUE THAT RECOGNIZES A PERSON'S IDENTITY BASED ON HIS OR HER SPEECHES.
utt_0011 utt 47.60 54.74 -X NOWADAYS, SPEAKER RECOGNITION HAS LOTS OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING VOICE ASSISTANT WAKE UP,
utt_0012 utt 54.74 59.41 -X SUCH AS HEY SIRI, PERSONALIZED SERVICE ON SMART HOME,
utt_0013 utt 60.56 67.19 -X IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTION, AND APPLICATION LOG IN BY VOICE PRINT.
utt_0014 utt 68.85 75.19 -X AS CAN BE SEEN ABOVE, SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS MOSTLY USED IN SAFETY-CRITICAL SCENARIO.
utt_0015 utt 76.37 83.73 -X SO ONCE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN, IT WILL CAUSE PROPERTY DAMAGE, REGULATION DEGRADE,
utt_0016 utt 83.73 85.75 -X SENSITIVE INFORMATION LEAK AND SO ON.
utt_0017 utt 87.18 92.40 -X SO THE SECURITY OF SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
utt_0018 utt 93.68 99.09 -X THE MAINSTREAM IMPLEMENTATION OF SPEAKER RECOGNITION IS MACHINE LEARNING.
utt_0019 utt 99.63 105.30 -X HOWEVER MACHINE LEARNING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE VULNERABLE TO ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES.
utt_0020 utt 105.87 109.27 -X I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE QUITE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PICTURE.
utt_0021 utt 109.49 116.72 -X THE BENIGN EXAMPLE CONTAINS A PANDA, AND THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL CORRECTLY RECOGNIZES THE BENIGN EXAMPLE AS A PANDA.
utt_0023 utt 117.84 123.38 -X THE ATTACKER ADDS PERTURBATION TO THE BENIGN EXAMPLE TO COMPUTE AN ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLE.
utt_0024 utt 123.89 127.76 -X ALTHOUGH THE ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLE STILL LOOKS LIKE A PANDA TO HUMAN USERS,
utt_0025 utt 127.92 134.17 -X THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL RECOGNIZES THE ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLE AS A GIBBON WITH VERY HIGH CONFIDENCE.
utt_0027 utt 135.06 140.57 -X THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT IS AN EXAMPLE OF ADVERSARIAL ATTACK IN SPEECH-TO-TEXT DOMAIN.
utt_0028 utt 141.81 144.31 -X SO HERE THERE IS A NATURAL QUESTION.
utt_0029 utt 144.63 148.66 -X IS ADVERSARIAL ATTACK PRACTICAL ON SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS?
utt_0030 utt 149.49 153.24 -X WE ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY PROPOSING AN ATTACK CALLED FAKEBOB.
utt_0031 utt 153.62 155.57 -X FAKEBOB IS BLACK-BOX.
utt_0032 utt 155.57 159.89 -X IT CAN BE APPLIED TO GENERAL SPEAKER RECOGNITION TASK.
utt_0033 utt 159.89 163.19 -X IT REMAINS EFFECTIVE ON COMMERCIAL SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.
utt_0034 utt 163.35 167.32 -X IT IS EFFECTIVE IN OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK.
utt_0035 utt 167.32 173.97 -X BEFORE I PRESENT THE DETAIL OF OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB, LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THE THREAT MODEL WE USE IN OUR PAPER.
utt_0037 utt 174.74 177.69 -X THERE IS A VICTIM SPEAKER MODEL IN THIS PICTURE.
utt_0038 utt 177.94 184.82 -X IN NORMAL CASE, A PIECE OF VOICE FROM AN ILLEGAL SPEAKER WILL BE REJECTED BY THE VICTIM'S SPEAKER MODEL.
utt_0039 utt 185.27 190.58 -X THE ATTACKER ADDS PERTURBATION TO THE ORIGINAL VOICE TO COMPUTE AN ADVERSARIAL VOICE.
utt_0040 utt 190.77 196.50 -X THE ADVERSARIAL VOICE CAN SUCCESSFULLY PASS THE VOICE AUTHENTICATION OF THE VICTIM SPEAKER MODEL,
utt_0041 utt 196.53 199.54 -X THAT IS, BEING ACCEPTED BY THIS MODEL.
utt_0042 utt 199.76 204.15 -X SO THE ATTACKER CAN GAIN ACCESS TO PRIVILEGE OF THE VICTIM.
utt_0043 utt 205.40 211.06 -X THE ATTACKER HAS NO ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE MODEL INTERNAL STRUCTURE OR PARAMETERS.
utt_0044 utt 212.44 219.42 -X HE IS LIMITED TO QUERY THE VICTIM SPEAKER MODEL, THAT IS, PROVIDE SOME INPUTS AND OBTAIN THE OUTPUTS.
utt_0045 utt 221.68 224.73 -X THIS IS THE OVERVIEW OF OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB.
utt_0046 utt 224.73 226.81 -X THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS.
utt_0047 utt 228.63 235.64 -X FIRSTLY, SINCE THE GENERATION OF ADVERSARIAL VOICES IS FORMULATED AS AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM,
utt_0048 utt 235.83 239.38 -X THE FIRST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TO DESIGN THE LOSS FUNCTION.
utt_0049 utt 240.40 246.65 -X OUR GOAL IS THAT THE LOSS FUNCTION SHOULD BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF WHETHER THE ATTACK SUCCEEDS OR NOT.
utt_0050 utt 246.90 255.03 -X THAT IS, THE LOSS FUNCTION IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ZERO IF AND ONLY IF THE ATTACK SUCCEEDS.
utt_0051 utt 255.03 263.10 -X AFTER SEVERAL TRIAL, WE DESIGN THE LOSS FUNCTION BASED ON THE SCORING AND DECISION-MAKING MECHANISM OF SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.
utt_0053 utt 263.35 269.82 -X FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THE OPEN-SET IDENTIFICATION TASK MAKES THE DECISION BASED ON A PRE-DEFINED THRESHOLD,
utt_0054 utt 270.17 274.65 -X WE INCORPORATE THIS THRESHOLD INTO THE LOSS FUNCTION.
utt_0055 utt 274.65 279.39 -X IN ADDITION, SINCE DIFFERENT TASKS HAVE DIFFERENT SCORING AND DECISION-MAKING MECHANISMS,
utt_0056 utt 279.45 282.55 -X WE DESIGN DIFFERENT LOSS FUNCTIONS FOR DIFFERENT TASKS.
utt_0057 utt 283.48 291.80 -X SECONDLY UNLIKE IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON A PRE-DEFINED THRESHOLD.
utt_0058 utt 292.66 300.22 -X ONLY WHEN THE MAXIMUM SCORE OF ADVERSARIAL VOICES IS LARGER THAN THE THRESHOLD CAN THE ATTACK SUCCEED.
utt_0060 utt 300.47 304.35 -X UNFORTUNATELY THIS THRESHOLD IS UNKNOWN TO THE ATTACKER.
utt_0061 utt 305.24 311.77 -X TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A THRESHOLD ESTIMATION ALGORITHM.
utt_0062 utt 311.77 319.00 -X ONCE WE OBTAIN THE ESTIMATED THRESHOLD, WE REPLACE THE TRUE THRESHOLD IN THE LOSS FUNCTION WITH THE ESTIMATED ONE.
utt_0064 utt 319.45 322.94 -X OUR ESTIMATED THRESHOLD IS LARGER THAN THE TRUE THRESHOLD.
utt_0065 utt 322.94 326.24 -X THIS GUARANTEES THAT THE ATTACK WILL SUCCEED.
utt_0066 utt 326.24 332.16 -X AT THE SAME TIME, OUR ESTIMATED THRESHOLD IS NOT TOO FAR FROM THE TRUE THRESHOLD,
utt_0067 utt 332.16 334.46 -X SO THE ATTACK WILL NOT BE TOO EXPENSIVE.
utt_0068 utt 336.02 345.34 -X IN WHITE-BOX ATTACK, THE ATTACKER USUALLY USES BACKPROPAGATION TO OBTAIN THE EXACT GRADIENT WHICH IS THEN USED TO SOLVE THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM.
utt_0070 utt 345.88 357.21 -X HOWEVER BACKPROPAGATION IS NOT AVAILABLE IN BLACK BOX ATTACK BECAUSE THE ATTACKER HAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT MODEL STRUCTURES OR PARAMETERS.
utt_0072 utt 357.21 368.73 -X SO HERE WE USE NATURAL EVOLUTION STRATEGY BASED GRADIENT ESTIMATION METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE GRADIENT INSTEAD OF USING THE EXACT GRADIENT.
utt_0074 utt 368.73 377.63 -X THIS METHOD ONLY RELIES ON SCORES AND DECISIONS RETURNED BY VICTIM SPEAKER MODEL WHEN WE QUERY THE MODEL.
utt_0076 utt 377.63 381.66 -X THIS ALLOWS US TO ACHIEVE BLACK-BOX ATTACK.
utt_0077 utt 381.66 392.41 -X AFTER WE OBTAIN THE ESTIMATED GRADIENT INFORMATION, WE CAN USE IT TO SOLVE THE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM BY GRADIENT DESCENT, AND FINALLY WE CAN OBTAIN THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES.
utt_0079 utt 393.95 400.38 -X ADVERSARIAL ATTACK IN SPEECH DOMAIN CAN BE DIVIDED INTO API ATTACK AND OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK.
utt_0080 utt 400.79 407.68 -X API ATTACK MEANS THE ATTACKER DIRECTLY FEEDS THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES TO THE MODEL BY THE MODEL'S API.
utt_0081 utt 408.64 422.75 -X IN CONTRAST, TO LAUNCH OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK, THE ATTACKER NEEDS TO PLAY THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES BY SOME LOUDSPEAKERS, THEN THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES ARE TRANSMITTED IN THE AIR CHANNEL, AND FINALLY RECEIVED BY THE MICROPHONES
utt_0084 utt 422.75 425.18 -X OF SPEAKER RECOGNITION DEVICES.
utt_0085 utt 427.90 432.00 -X OVER THE ATTACK IS MORE CHALLENGING THAN API ATTACK.
utt_0086 utt 432.00 437.95 -X THE REASON IS THAT THE NOISE INTRODUCED IN THE AIR CHANNEL WILL MAKE THE ATTACK LOSE EFFECTIVENESS.
utt_0087 utt 439.23 445.54 -X PREVIOUS WORK SOLVES THIS PROBLEM BY MODELING THE NOISE DURING THE GENERATION OF ADVERSARIAL VOICES.
utt_0088 utt 446.27 452.06 -X THE LIMITATION OF THIS SOLUTION IS THAT IT IS SOMEHOW ENVIRONMENT AND DEVICE DEPENDENT.
utt_0089 utt 452.67 458.05 -X INSTEAD, OUR SOLUTION IS TO SIMPLY IMPROVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES.
utt_0090 utt 459.74 468.58 -X ALTHOUGH OUR SOLUTION IS A LITTLE SIMPLE, OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULT SHOWS THAT OUR SOLUTION IS QUITE EFFECTIVE.
utt_0091 utt 468.58 472.07 -X OKAY, NOW LET'S TURN TO THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.
utt_0092 utt 473.60 480.71 -X ON OPEN-SOURCE SYSTEMS, OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB CAN ACHIEVE NEARLY one hundred% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE.
utt_0093 utt 481.79 487.07 -X WE ALSO EVALUATE OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB ON TWO COMMERCIAL SPEAKER RECOGNITION SYSTEMS.
utt_0094 utt 487.81 490.21 -X THE FIRST ONE IS TALENTEDSOFT.
utt_0095 utt 490.56 497.73 -X BECAUSE TALENTEDSOFT RETURNS BOTH SCORES AND DECISIONS AFTER WE QUERY THE VICTIM SPEAKER MODEL,
utt_0096 utt 497.73 501.31 -X WE DIRECTLY GENERATE ADVERSARIAL VOICES ON THIS SYSTEM.
utt_0097 utt 502.49 506.24 -X OUR ATTACK ACHIEVES one hundred% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE,
utt_0098 utt 506.30 510.18 -X AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF QUERIES IS TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED.
utt_0099 utt 511.55 514.24 -X THE SECOND ONE IS MICROSOFT AZURE.
utt_0100 utt 514.24 521.89 -X BECAUSE MICROSOFT AZURE ONLY RETURNS DECISIONS AFTER WE QUERY THE VICTIM'S SPEAKER MODEL,
utt_0101 utt 521.89 524.93 -X WE USE TRANSFER ATTACK TO ATTACK THIS SYSTEM.
utt_0102 utt 526.05 531.91 -X OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB ACHIEVES twenty-six% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE ON THE VICTIM'S SPEAKER MODEL,
utt_0103 utt 532.00 534.63 -X MUCH LOWER THAN THAT ON TALENTEDSOFT.
utt_0104 utt 535.65 541.89 -X THE REASON IS THAT TRANSFER ATTACK INHERENTLY SUFFERS FROM LOW ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE.
utt_0105 utt 545.06 549.73 -X FOR OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK, OUR ATTACK REMAINS EFFECTIVE
utt_0106 utt 549.79 553.89 -X ACROSS DIFFERENT DISTANCES BETWEEN THE LOUDSPEAKER AND THE MICROPHONE.
utt_0107 utt 554.62 560.16 -X WHEN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN LOUDSPEAKER AND MICROPHONE IS NO MORE THAN TWO METERS,
utt_0108 utt 560.16 565.03 -X OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB CAN ACHIEVE AT LEAST seventy% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE.
utt_0109 utt 566.66 573.57 -X WE CONSIDER THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOUDSPEAKERS, LAPTOP, PORTABLE SPEAKER, AND BROADCAST EQUIPMENT.
utt_0110 utt 574.40 577.25 -X WE ALSO CONSIDER TWO DIFFERENT MICROPHONES.
utt_0111 utt 577.25 580.81 -X THE FIRST ONE IS THE MICROPHONE ON ISO SYSTEM.
utt_0112 utt 581.19 584.84 -X THE OTHER ONE IS THE MICROPHONE ON ANDROID SYSTEM.
utt_0113 utt 586.11 591.24 -X TOTALLY WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF LOUDSPEAKERS AND MICROPHONES.
utt_0114 utt 591.65 598.25 -X NO MATTER WHAT THE COMBINATION IS, OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB CAN ACHIEVE AT LEAST seventy% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE.
utt_0115 utt 598.50 605.73 -X THIS SHOWS THAT OUR ATTACK IS DEVICE INDEPENDENT TO SOME EXTENT.
utt_0116 utt 605.79 612.29 -X WE SIMULATE DIFFERENT ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENTS BY INTRODUCING DIFFERENT TYPES OF NOISES,
utt_0117 utt 612.29 616.58 -X SUCH AS WHITE NOISE, BUS NOISE, RESTAURANT NOISE, AND MUSIC NOISE.
utt_0118 utt 617.64 622.79 -X WHEN THE NOISE IS LESS THAN sixtyDB, OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB CAN ACHIEVE
utt_0119 utt 623.46 625.74 -X AT LEAST forty-eight% ATTACK SUCCESSFUL RATE.
utt_0120 utt 626.08 631.56 -X THIS SHOWS THAT OUR ATTACK IS ENVIRONMENT INDEPENDENT TO SOME EXTENT.
utt_0121 utt 632.68 637.13 -X ADVERSARIAL ATTACK SHOULD NOT ONLY MAKE THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL MISBEHAVE,
utt_0122 utt 637.19 640.55 -X BUT SHOULD ALSO BE IMPERCEPTIBLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS,
utt_0123 utt 640.55 644.46 -X SO WE NEED TO EVALUATE THE IMPERCEPTIBILITY OF OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB.
utt_0124 utt 645.22 650.02 -X HOWEVER IMPERCEPTIBILITY HAS DIFFERENT MEANINGS IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS.
utt_0125 utt 650.47 659.43 -X FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION, IMPERCEPTIBILITY MEANS HUMANS RECOGNIZE THE ORIGINAL AND ADVERSARIAL IMAGES AS THE SAME OBJECTS.
utt_0127 utt 660.23 666.09 -X FOR SPEECH-TO-TEXT, IMPERCEPTIBILITY MEANS THE USER HEARS THE SAME SENTENCE
utt_0128 utt 666.21 668.97 -X IN THE ORIGINAL AND ADVERSARIAL SPEECHES.
utt_0129 utt 669.41 675.34 -X SO FIRST WE HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT IMPERCEPTIBILITY MEANS IN SPEAKER RECOGNITION.
utt_0130 utt 676.90 681.35 -X SUPPOSE ALICE IS THE SOURCE SPEAKER, AND SHE UTTERS A VOICE.
utt_0131 utt 681.41 686.57 -X THE ATTACKER ADDS PERTURBATION TO THE ORIGINAL VOICE TO COMPUTE AN ADVERSARIAL VOICE.
utt_0132 utt 687.85 693.00 -X BOB'S SPEAKER MODEL THINKS THE ADVERSARIAL VOICE IS UTTERED BY BOB HIMSELF.
utt_0133 utt 694.60 700.91 -X HOWEVER A THIRD PERSON THINKS THE ADVERSARIAL VOICE IS FROM ALICE WHEN LISTENING TO THIS VOICE.
utt_0135 utt 701.70 708.33 -X AND THIS IS THE IMPERCEPTIBILITY IN SPEAKER RECOGNITION.
utt_0136 utt 708.33 713.07 -X WE CONDUCT A QUANTITY ANALYSIS OF IMPERCEPTIBILITY OF OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB.
utt_0137 utt 717.38 720.11 -X OUR QUESTION IS THAT HOW MANY PEOPLE THINK
utt_0138 utt 720.20 724.40 -X ADVERSARIAL AND ORIGINAL VOICES ARE UTTERED BY THE SAME SPEAKER.
utt_0139 utt 725.19 730.38 -X TO GET THE ANSWER, WE CARRY OUR A HUMAN STUDY ON AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK.
utt_0140 utt 733.90 738.38 -X FOR API ATTACK, sixty-four point nine% OF PEOPLE THINK ADVERSARIAL AND ORIGINAL VOICES
utt_0141 utt 738.60 745.00 -X ARE UTTERED BY THE SAME SPEAKER, INDICATING GOOD IMPERCEPTIBILITY OF OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB.
utt_0142 utt 746.82 753.55 -X FOR OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK, THE RESULT IS thirty-four%, LOWER THAN THAT OF API ATTACK.
utt_0143 utt 754.50 758.67 -X THIS IS NOT SURPRISING, BECAUSE TO LAUNCH OVER-THE-AIR ATTACK,
utt_0144 utt 758.67 762.16 -X WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE CONFIDENCE OF ADVERSARIAL VOICES.
utt_0145 utt 762.38 766.19 -X THIS WILL INTRODUCE LARGER PERTURBATION TO THE ADVERSARIAL VOICES.
utt_0146 utt 766.38 768.72 -X SO THE IMPERCEPTIBILITY BECOMES WORSE.
utt_0147 utt 771.53 774.80 -X OKAY, THAT'S ALL FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION.
utt_0148 utt 774.80 777.10 -X THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
utt_0149 utt 777.10 783.09 -X IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR ATTACK FAKEBOB, YOU CAN EXPLORE OUR OFFICIAL WEBSITE.
utt_0150 utt 783.09 788.46 -X IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RELEASED OUR CODE FOR REPRODUCING OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS.
utt_0151 utt 788.71 790.99 -1.8866 THANKS FOR LISTENING AGAIN. BYE BYE.
