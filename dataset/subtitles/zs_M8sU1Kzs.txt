utt_0000 utt 1.07 10.70 -X HI, MY NAME IS ALESSIO AND I AM GLAD TO PRESENT YOU TODAY THE CORSMAL CHALLENGE ON AUDIO-VISUAL OBJECT CLASSIFICATION FOR HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION.
utt_0002 utt 10.80 12.11 -X BEFORE STARTING,
utt_0003 utt 12.11 18.80 -X I WOULD LIKE ALSO TO THANK THE OTHER ORGANISERS YIK, TIMOTHY, AHALYA, BERK AND ANDREA.
utt_0004 utt 25.07 29.17 -X THE CORSMAL CHALLENGE IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING FROM AUDIO-VISUAL DATA
utt_0005 utt 29.20 34.07 -X DIFFERENT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF HOUSEHOLD CONTAINERS FOR FOOD AND DRINKS.
utt_0006 utt 34.32 45.33 -X THESE CONTAINERS ARE MANIPULATED BY A PERSON PRIOR TO A HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION AND COULD BE RELEVANT FOR ASSISTIVE SCENARIOS AT HOME OR IN A WORKPLACE.
utt_0009 utt 62.45 64.56 -X AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE EXAMPLES,
utt_0010 utt 64.56 68.79 -X CONTAINERS CAN VARY IN THEIR SHAPE, SIZE, WEIGHT OR APPEARANCE,
utt_0011 utt 68.79 72.34 -X OR THEY CAN BE OCCLUDED BY THE HUMAN HAND DURING MANIPULATION.
utt_0012 utt 74.38 86.93 -X OUR CHALLENGE PROVIDES A BENCHMARKING FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS THE DESIGN AND EVALUATION OF NOVEL AUDIOVISUAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CONTAINERS IN THESE CHALLENGING SCENARIOS.
utt_0015 utt 87.15 90.58 -X THE SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE ACCURATE, ROBUST,
utt_0016 utt 90.58 95.64 -X SAFE AND ADAPTIVE TO CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN-TO-ROBOTS HANDOVERS.
utt_0017 utt 102.70 108.12 -X GIVEN AN AUDIOVISUAL INPUT, WE DEFINED FIVE TASKS FOR THE CHALLENGE.
utt_0018 utt 108.12 112.72 -X EACH TASK IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PHYSICAL PROPERTY THAT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED BY THE ALGORITHMS.
utt_0020 utt 113.49 121.30 -X THE GOAL OF THE FIRST TASK IS TO CLASSIFY THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT WITHIN A MANIPULATED CONTAINER AS EMPTY, HALF-FULL OR FULL.
utt_0022 utt 124.05 128.41 -X THE GOAL OF THE SECOND TASK IS TO CLASSIFY THE TYPE OF CONTENT, IF ANY,
utt_0023 utt 128.41 132.31 -X WITHIN A MANIPULATED CONTAINER AS WATER, RICE OR PASTA.
utt_0024 utt 133.27 137.27 -X THE GOAL OF THE THIRD TASK IS TO ESTIMATE THE CAPACITY OF THE CONTAINER.
utt_0025 utt 137.52 141.53 -X THE GOAL OF THE FOURTH TASK IS TO ESTIMATE THE MASS OF THE CONTAINER.
utt_0026 utt 141.68 150.33 -X THE GOAL OF THE LAST TASK IS TO ESTIMATE THE WIDTH AT THE TOP, THE WIDTH AT THE BOTTOM AND THE HEIGHT OF THE CONTAINER.
utt_0028 utt 151.99 156.98 -X CORSMAL CONTAINER MANIPULATION IS THE REFERENCE DATASET FOR THE CHALLENGE
utt_0029 utt 158.77 164.44 -X AND CONTAINS one thousand, one hundred and forty AUDIO-VISUAL RECORDINGS OF twelve PEOPLE MANIPULATING fifteen DIFFERENT
utt_0030 utt 164.44 176.06 -X CONTAINERS WITH THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTENT.
utt_0031 utt 184.21 196.47 -X THE DATASET WAS ACQUIRED WITH A MULTI-MODAL MULTI-SENSOR SETUP CONSISTING OF FOUR RGBD CAMERAS AND A CIRCULAR ARRAY OF EIGHT MICROPHONES PLACED UNDER THE FIXED ROBOT VIEW.
utt_0034 utt 196.98 202.90 -X EACH RECORDING CORRESPONDS TO A CONFIGURATION THAT CONSISTS OF A PERSON MANIPULATING ONE OF THE fifteen
utt_0036 utt 203.00 206.62 -X CONTAINERS WITH ONE CONTENT AT A PREDEFINED AMOUNT.
utt_0037 utt 206.74 211.00 -X THE CONFIGURATION WAS ALSO ACQUIRED IN A SPECIFIED SCENARIO,
utt_0038 utt 211.06 214.33 -X BACKGROUND, AND ILLUMINATION CONDITION.
utt_0039 utt 214.33 223.96 -X FOR THE CHALLENGE, WE SPLIT THE DATASET BASED ON A SELECTION OF THE CONTAINERS INTO TRAINING SET, PUBLIC TEST SET AND PRIVATE TEST SET.
utt_0041 utt 225.40 237.98 -X WE ALSO IDENTIFY THREE MANIPULATION SCENARIOS THAT HAVE INCREASED DIFFICULTY LEVELS DUE TO HAND OCCLUSIONS, PERSON ENTERING THE FIELD OF VIEW AND DIFFERENT DYNAMICS AND ACTIONS PERFORMED BY THE PERSON.
utt_0044 utt 241.81 243.39 -X IN THE FIRST SCENARIO,
utt_0045 utt 243.39 246.94 -X THE SUBJECT SITS IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT WHILE A CONTAINER IS ON A TABLE.
utt_0046 utt 247.06 256.38 -X THE SUBJECT EITHER POURS THE CONTENT INTO AN EMPTY DRINKING GLASS OR CUP WHILE AVOIDING TOUCHING THE CONTAINER OR SHAKES AN ALREADY FILLED FOOT BOX.
utt_0048 utt 256.86 261.05 -X AFTERWARDS, THE SUBJECT INITIATES THE HANDOVER OF THE CONTAINER TO THE ROBOT.
utt_0049 utt 262.90 264.38 -X IN THE SECOND SCENARIO,
utt_0050 utt 264.38 268.09 -X THE SUBJECT SITS IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT WHILE HOLDING A CONTAINER,
utt_0051 utt 268.09 270.24 -X BEFORE STARTING THE MANIPULATION.
utt_0052 utt 270.24 274.01 -X THE SUBJECT THEN INITIATES THE HANDOVER OF THE CONTAINER TO THE ROBOT.
utt_0053 utt 275.16 276.60 -X IN THE THIRD SCENARIO,
utt_0054 utt 276.60 280.44 -X A CONTAINER IS HELD BY THE SUBJECT WHILE STANDING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROBOT,
utt_0055 utt 280.47 283.87 -X POTENTIALLY VISIBLE ONLY ON THE THIRD PERSON CAMERA VIEW.
utt_0056 utt 284.31 289.15 -X THE SUBJECT MANIPULATES THE CONTAINER EITHER BEFORE OR WHILE WALKING IN.
utt_0057 utt 289.15 296.61 -X WHEN IN FRONT OF THE ROBOT, THE SUBJECT INITIATES THE HANDOVER OF THE CONTAINER.
utt_0059 utt 296.95 308.00 -X AS THE GOAL OF THE CHALLENGE IS ALSO TO TARGET HUMAN-ROBOT COLLABORATION, WE PROVIDED A REAL-TO-SIMULATION FRAMEWORK THAT VALIDATES THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ESTIMATED BY THE PARTICIPANTS
utt_0062 utt 308.00 312.61 -X TO THE CHALLENGE INTO A SIMULATED HUMAN-TO-ROBOT HANDOVER SCENARIO.
utt_0063 utt 313.37 319.17 -X TO ACHIEVE THIS, THE FIRST THREE TASKS ARE COMBINED TO ESTIMATE THE FILLING MASS WITH A NON-LINEAR FORMULA.
utt_0065 utt 319.42 327.68 -X THE FILLING MASS IS THEN ADDED TO THE CONTAINER MASS TO PROVIDE THE ESTIMATED OBJECT WEIGHT TO THE SIMULATOR, ALONG WITH THE ESTIMATED OBJECT DIMENSIONS.
utt_0068 utt 328.25 337.57 -X FOR FAIRNESS ACROSS THE CHALLENGE SOLUTIONS, THE SIMULATOR TAKES ADDITIONAL OBJECT ANNOTATIONS AS INPUT TO MAKE THE TASK AS REPRODUCIBLE AS POSSIBLE,
utt_0070 utt 337.57 342.08 -X AND THEREFORE ONLY THE PREDICTED PHYSICAL PROPERTIES SHOULD IMPACT THE PERFORMANCE.
utt_0071 utt 342.78 347.84 -X THE SIMULATION THEN VISUALISES AND ASSESSES THE OBJECT SAFETY AND THE DELIVERY ACCURACY.
utt_0073 utt 348.54 357.44 -X WE DEFINE OBJECT SAFETY AS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE FORCE APPLIED BY THE ROBOT ENABLES A GRIPPER TO HOLD THE CONTAINER WITHOUT DROPPING IT OR BREAKING IT.
utt_0075 utt 359.20 360.86 -X FOR THE DELIVERY ACCURACY,
utt_0076 utt 360.86 368.26 -X THE CONTAINER SHOULD BE PLACED UPRIGHT AND WITHIN THE PREDEFINED TARGET AREA.
utt_0077 utt 368.26 378.21 -X HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES OF OUR SIMULATED HUMAN-TO-ROBOT HANDOVER USING PHYSICAL PROPERTIES ESTIMATED FROM REAL VIDEO RECORDINGS OF THE PUBLIC TEST SET.
utt_0079 utt 378.78 388.35 -X AS OBJECT ANNOTATIONS, WE INCLUDED AN OFFLINE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE threeD CONTAINER SHAPE, THE TRUE OBJECT WEIGHT, AND THE OBJECT POSE OVER TIME.
utt_0081 utt 389.47 394.34 -X THE CONTAINER SHAPE IS RENDERED IN THE SIMULATOR USING THE TRUE OBJECT WEIGHT.
utt_0082 utt 394.34 401.03 -X HOWEVER, THE WEIGHT DOES NOT AFFECT THE ROBOT CONTROL, BUT IT IS ONLY USED FOR VALIDATION OF THE OBJECT SAFETY.
utt_0084 utt 401.60 409.51 -X THE OBJECT POSE IS MANUALLY ANNOTATED EVERY TEM FRAMES AND WE THEN PERFORMED INTERPOLATION IN THE INTERMEDIATE FRAMES.
utt_0086 utt 409.51 412.00 -X THIS CAN RESULT IN NON-REALISTIC MOTIONS
utt_0087 utt 412.00 440.10 -X COMPARED TO THE REAL VIDEO, FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SHAKING MOVEMENT OF THE VIDEO ON TOP.
utt_0088 utt 440.10 443.78 -X IN ADDITION TO THE TASKS, THE DATASET AND THE SIMULATOR,
utt_0089 utt 444.61 453.64 -X WE COMPUTE thirteen PERFORMANCE SCORES TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT GRANULARITY INTO THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE AUDIOVISUAL ALGORITHMS AND PIPELINES.
utt_0091 utt 455.42 461.03 -X THE FIRST SEVEN SCORES DIRECTLY QUANTIFY THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATION FOR THE MAIN CHALLENGE TASKS.
utt_0093 utt 462.18 475.11 -X OTHER THREE SCORES EVALUATE GROUPS OF TASKS AND ASSESS FILLING MASS ESTIMATION, JOINT FILLING TYPE AND LEVEL CLASSIFICATION, AND JOINT CONTAINER CAPACITY AND DIMENSIONS ESTIMATION.
utt_0096 utt 475.33 483.81 -X OTHER TWO SCORES ARE AN INDIRECT EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ESTIMATION ON THE QUALITY OF HUMAN-TO-ROBOT HANDOVER IN SIMULATION.
utt_0098 utt 483.81 494.73 -X I WOULD LIKE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION THAT THE SCORES FOR FILLING MASS, OBJECT MASS, AND POSE DELIVERY MAY USE RANDOM ESTIMATIONS FOR EITHER OF THE TASKS NOT ADDRESSED BY AN ALGORITHM.
utt_0101 utt 499.07 503.65 -X FOR FILLING LEVEL AND TYPE CLASSIFICATION, WE COMPUTED THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE Fminus one SCORE.
utt_0102 utt 503.65 505.77 -X FOR THE OTHER MEASURES,
utt_0103 utt 505.77 513.25 -X WE COMPUTED THE RELATIVE ABSOLUTE ERROR FOLLOWED BY EITHER A NORMALISATION FUNCTION OR EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION TO CONVERT THE ERROR INTO A SCORE.
utt_0105 utt 513.92 521.00 -X WE ALSO INCLUDED AN INDICATOR FUNCTION TO ACCOUNT FOR CONFIGURATION NOT ESTIMATED IN THE TEST SET BY AN ALGORITHM.
utt_0107 utt 521.00 530.95 -X THE OVERALL SCORE IS THEN COMPUTED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE FIRST TEN SCORES IN THE TABLE.
utt_0109 utt 530.95 533.86 -X THE CHALLENGE RECEIVED SUBMISSIONS FROM THREE TEAMS.
utt_0110 utt 533.86 538.70 -X THREE ALGORITHMS WERE SUBMITTED FOR THE CONTAINER MASS ESTIMATION.
utt_0111 utt 538.82 544.20 -X TWO ALGORITHMS WERE SUBMITTED FOR ESTIMATING THE CAPACITY AND DIMENSIONS OF A CONTAINER.
utt_0113 utt 544.29 548.90 -X TWO ALGORITHMS WERE SUBMITTED FOR CLASSIFYING THE LEVEL AND TYPE OF THE CONTENT.
utt_0115 utt 549.92 553.74 -X ALGORITHMS USE DIFFERENT MODALITIES FOR SOLVING THE DIFFERENT TASKS.
utt_0116 utt 554.18 560.30 -X FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A PREFERENCE FOR THE AUDIO MODALITY WHEN CLASSIFYING FILLING TYPE AND LEVEL,
utt_0118 utt 560.48 564.14 -X BUT ONE TEAM USE BOTH AUDIO AND VISION.
utt_0119 utt 565.67 569.35 -X VISION IS IN THE PREFERRED FOR ESTIMATING THE CONTAINER PROPERTIES.
utt_0120 utt 574.37 580.97 -X TWO TEAMS USE THE VISUAL DATA FROM THE FRONT FIXED VIEW, WHILE ONE TEAM EXPLOITED ALL THE THREE FIXED VIEWS.
utt_0122 utt 581.41 585.74 -X MOST OF THE ALGORITHMS USED EFFICIENT OR SHALLOW CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS.
utt_0123 utt 585.74 597.93 -X ON THE CONTRARY, ONE TEAM EXPLOITED THE RECENT TRANSFORMER MODEL FOR CLASSIFYING FILLING TYPE AND LEVEL AND USE A MULTI-VIEW GEOMETRIC APPROACH FOR CONTAINER CAPACITY AND DIMENSIONS ESTIMATION.
utt_0126 utt 597.93 608.55 -X ALL TEAMS ALSO USED OBJECT DETECTOR OR INSTANCE SEGMENTATION TO IDENTIFY THE CONTAINER IN THE VIDEO FOR ESTIMATING THE CAPACITY, MASS AND DIMENSIONS OF A CONTAINER.
utt_0129 utt 610.44 623.53 -X THE ALGORITHMS OF THE TEAMS HAVE BEEN RANKED ACROSS TEN LEADERBOARDS THAT COVER THE INDIVIDUAL TASKS, THE GROUP OF TASKS, AND THE OVERALL SCORE FOR THE PUBLIC TEST SET, THE PRIVATE TEST SET AND THEIR COMBINATION.
utt_0132 utt 623.53 628.27 -X THE LEADERBOARDS ON THE WEBSITE ALSO CONTAIN PAST CHALLENGE ENTRIES AND BASELINES.
utt_0134 utt 628.27 632.59 -X HERE ARE SOME OF THE LEADERBOARDS AND YOU CAN FIND ALL THE RESULTS ON OUR CHALLENGE WEB PAGE.
utt_0136 utt 634.25 645.00 -X IN THIS TABLE, WE FOCUS ON THE RESULTS COMPUTED ON THE COMBINED TEST SETS OF THE CORSMAL CONTAINERS MANIPULATION DATASET AND WE COMPARE THE ALGORITHMS SUBMITTED BY THE TEAMS AND TWO BASELINES.
utt_0139 utt 645.86 656.97 -X ONE BASELINE ESTIMATES THE PROPERTIES WITH A PSEUDO-RANDOM GENERATOR AND THE OTHER BY USING THE AVERAGE OF THE TRAINING SET FOR CONTAINER CAPACITY, MASS AND DIMENSIONS.
utt_0142 utt 657.90 665.23 -X THE ALGORITHMS DESIGNED BY WANG’S TEAM ARE THE BEST PERFORMING ACROSS MOST OF THE SCORES, INCLUDING THE OVERALL SCORE OF THE CHALLENGE.
utt_0144 utt 665.93 671.18 -X THE ALGORITHMS OF MATSUBARA’S TEAM ACHIEVED THE BEST PERFORMANCE FOR CONTAINER CAPACITY,
utt_0146 utt 671.18 676.08 -X FILLING MASS AND THE JOINT ESTIMATION OF CONTAINER CAPACITY AND DIMENSIONS.
utt_0147 utt 677.26 681.93 -X THE ALGORITHM OF APICELLA’S TEAM ACHIEVES THE SECOND-BEST PERFORMING SCORE FOR CONTAINER MASS.
utt_0149 utt 684.14 697.07 -X TO RECAP, THE CORSMAL CHALLENGE IS A BENCHMARKING FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS THE DESIGN AND ASSESSMENT OF AUDIOVISUAL ALGORITHMS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF CONTAINERS MANIPULATED BY A PERSON.
utt_0153 utt 697.10 699.15 -X FOR THE CHALLENGE HOSTED AT ICASSP,
utt_0154 utt 700.04 708.40 -X WE DEFINED FIVE TASKS AND thirteen PERFORMANCE SCORES, AND WE FACILITATED THE COMPARISON BY RANKING THE ALGORITHMS ACROSS TEN LEADERBOARDS.
utt_0156 utt 709.13 719.31 -X WE ALSO INTRODUCED A REAL-TO-SIMULATION FRAMEWORK FOR VISUALISING THE SAFENESS AND ASSESSING THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATIONS WITHIN A SIMULATED HUMAN-TO-ROBOT HANDOVER SCENARIO.
utt_0159 utt 719.82 730.03 -X THE FRAMEWORK ALLOWS PARTICIPANTS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THEIR SOLUTIONS EVEN WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ROBOT AVAILABLE OR WHEN A PERSON IS MANIPULATING A FRAGILE CONTAINER.
utt_0162 utt 730.80 733.01 -X THE CHALLENGE IS NOT OVER!
