utt_0000 utt 2.48 6.35 -X HELLO EVERYONE! I'M YUE. IT'S MY PLEASURE TODAY TO PRESENT YOU OUR SDFDIFF,
utt_0001 utt 6.35 13.36 -X WHICH IS A NOVEL APPROACH FOR IMAGE-BASED SHAPE OPTIMIZATION USING DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERING OF threeD SHAPES REPRESENTED BY SIGNED DISTANCE FIELDS.
utt_0002 utt 14.80 20.02 -X THE DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERING STRATEGY HAS BEEN ATTRACTIVE AS A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO SOLVE REVERSE PROBLEMS,
utt_0003 utt 20.02 23.60 -X SUCH AS RECOVERING SHAPE OR APPEARANCE MODELS FROM IMAGES.
utt_0004 utt 24.02 28.92 -X COMBINING DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERING WITH NEURAL NETWORKS CAN ALSO SOLVE HIGHLY ILL-POSED INVERSE PROBLEMS,
utt_0005 utt 29.07 33.59 -X SUCH AS SINGLE-VIEW threeD RECONSTRUCTION.
utt_0006 utt 33.59 37.33 -X EXISTING DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERING APPROACHES ARE MOSTLY BASED ON TRIANGLE MESHES OR POINT CLOUDS.
utt_0007 utt 37.62 41.05 -X HOWEVER, MESH-BASED APPROACHES CANNOT CHANGE THE SURFACE TOPOLOGY,
utt_0008 utt 41.05 46.01 -X AND POINT CLOUD-BASED APPROACHES DO NOT PROVIDE CONTINUOUS AND WATERTIGHT SURFACES.
utt_0009 utt 46.58 54.30 -X COMPARED TO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, SIGNED DISTANCE FIELDS HAVE THE ADVANTAGES THAT THEY CAN REPRESENT SHAPES WITH ARBITRARY TOPOLOGY AND GUARANTEE WATERTIGHT SURFACES.
utt_0010 utt 54.30 59.03 -X IN THIS PROJECT, WE DEVELOPED SDFDIFF, AN SDF-BASED DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERING PROCESS.
utt_0011 utt 59.19 63.07 -X WE APPLIED OUR APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM OF MULTI-VIEW threeD RECONSTRUCTION,
utt_0012 utt 63.07 68.44 -X WHERE WE ACHIEVED HIGH CONSTRUCTION QUALITY AND COULD CAPTURE THE COMPLEX TOPOLOGY OF threeD OBJECTS.
utt_0013 utt 68.89 74.68 -X WE FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR SDF-BASED DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERER CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH DEEP LEARNING MODELS,
utt_0014 utt 74.68 81.72 -X WHICH OPENS UP OPTIONS FOR LEARNING APPROACHES ON threeD OBJECTS WITHOUT threeD SUPERVISION.
utt_0015 utt 82.07 85.15 -X WE DEVELOPED A DIFFERENTIABLE RENDERER BASED ON THE SPHERE TRACING.
utt_0016 utt 85.15 89.41 -X WE USE A DISCRETE SDF REPRESENTATION BY SAMPLING SDF VALUES ON A REGULAR GRID,
utt_0017 utt 89.41 96.83 -X AND WE APPLY A STANDARD RAY CASTING ALGORITHM BASED ON SPHERE TRACING TO FIND THE INTERSECTION POINTS BETWEEN RAYS AND THE OBJECT SURFACE.
utt_0018 utt 96.83 102.02 -X THEN WE LOCALLY COMPUTE PIXEL COLORS BASED ON THE LOCAL SET OF SDF SAMPLES.
utt_0019 utt 102.20 108.83 -X THE SPHERE TRACING STEP DOES NOT NEED TO BE DIFFERENTIABLE, SO THE COMPUTATION COST OF THIS STEP IS NEGLIGIBLE IN OUR APPROACH.
utt_0020 utt 108.89 114.15 -X ONLY THE LAST SHADING STEP USES AN AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION FRAMEWORK TO OBTAIN THE DERIVATIVES.
utt_0021 utt 114.24 122.44 -X SO THE DERIVATIVE OF A GIVEN PIXEL WITH RESPECT TO RENDERING PARAMETERS ONLY DEPENDS ON A LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHT SDF SAMPLES.
utt_0022 utt 125.89 133.00 -X GIVEN A SET OF PARAMETERS THETA REPRESENTING THE GEOMETRY DESCRIPTION AND THE RENDER R, IT IS A FORWARD OPERATION TO PRODUCE AN IMAGE I.
utt_0023 utt 135.59 140.29 -X IN CONTRAST, OPTIMIZING GEOMETRY AND OTHER SCENE PARAMETERS FROM IMAGES IS A BACKWARD PROCESS.
utt_0024 utt 140.29 146.73 -X GIVEN THE DESIRED TARGET IMAGE I, OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET THE SET OF PARAMETERS THETA THAT PRODUCES THE TARGET IMAGE.
utt_0025 utt 146.88 152.30 -X THE RENDERING PROCESS ITSELF IS NOT INVERTIBLE.
utt_0026 utt 152.30 160.01 -X SO, INSTEAD OF SOLVING THE REVERSE RENDERING PROBLEM DIRECTLY, WE CAN FORMULATE IT AS AN ENERGY MINIMIZATION PROBLEM.
utt_0027 utt 160.93 165.61 -X THE ENERGY FUNCTION OF OUR SDFDIFF APPROACH CONTAINS THREE PARTS.
utt_0028 utt 165.61 169.07 -X IMAGE LOSS IS THE Ltwo DISTANCE BETWEEN RENDERED IMAGES AND THE TARGET VIEWS.
utt_0029 utt 169.74 178.25 -X SDF LOSS ENSURES THE GRADIENTS TO HAVE UNIT MAGNITUDE SO THAT THE SDF VALUES REPRESENT A VALID SIGNED DISTANCE FUNCTION.
utt_0030 utt 178.25 185.10 -X WE ALSO HAVE A GEOMETRY LOSS TO REGULARIZE THE FINITE DIFFERENCE LAPLACIAN OF THE PREDICTED SDFS SO THAT WE CAN GET A SMOOTH SURFACE.
utt_0031 utt 186.95 192.72 -X HERE WE SHOW SOME RESULTS OF MULTI-VIEW threeD RECONSTRUCTION USING SHAPE OPTIMIZATION WITH OUR SDFDIFF APPROACH.
utt_0032 utt 192.87 198.00 -X USING A MULTI-RESOLUTION APPROACH, OUR OPTIMIZATION COULD CONVERGE TO HIGH-QUALITY RESOLUTIONS.
utt_0033 utt 198.09 204.46 -X OUR APPROACH IS ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT GEOMETRY WITH A HIGH-LEVEL OF DETAIL AND COMPLEX TOPOLOGY EVEN WITH FEW INPUT VIEWS.
utt_0034 utt 204.65 210.77 -X IN OUR EXPERIMENTS, WE USE twenty-six INPUT VIEWS PLACED AROUND THE OBJECT AND FACING TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE BOUNDING BOX.
utt_0035 utt 221.65 227.64 -X HERE WE USE A TOY EXAMPLE TO SHOW THAT OUR SDFDIFF APPROACH CAN CHANGE THE TOPOLOGY OF threeD SHAPES.
utt_0036 utt 246.39 252.89 -X WE LEVERAGE OUR SDFDIFF TO TRAIN A NEURAL NETWORK TO PERFORM A SINGLE threeD RECONSTRUCTION WITHOUT threeD SUPERVISION.
utt_0037 utt 254.45 257.08 -X THE INPUT IS AN IMAGE FROM THE SHAPENET DATASET,
utt_0038 utt 258.29 260.35 -X AND THE OUTPUT IS A DISCRETE SDF.
utt_0039 utt 260.35 268.06 -X THE LOSS FUNCTION CONTAINS IMAGE LOSS, SDF LOSS, AND GEOMETRY LOSS AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE.
utt_0040 utt 268.06 275.13 -X COMPARED TO OTHER METHODS, OUR SDFDIFF APPROACH CAN RECONSTRUCT DETAILED OBJECTS AND ACCURATELY RECOVER COMPLICATED TOPOLOGIES.
utt_0041 utt 275.48 282.72 -X OUR RESULTS ACHIEVE HIGHER ACCURACY THAN THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN TERMS OF threeD IOU SCORES IN MOST OF THE CATEGORIES OF SHAPENET.
utt_0042 utt 286.52 293.76 -3.4257 IN THE END, I APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORTS FROM MY CO-AUTHORS! THANK YOU AND TRY OUT OUR CODE!
