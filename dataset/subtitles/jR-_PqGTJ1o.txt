utt_0000 utt 0.72 8.34 -X HI, I AM YUNFENG, I AM PRESENTING OUR WORK BASAR: BLACK-BOX ATTACK ON SKELETAL ACTION RECOGNITION.
utt_0001 utt 8.34 18.74 -X THIS RESEARCH IS FROM A COLLABORATION AMONG UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS, SOUTHWEST JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY, ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF BATH
utt_0002 utt 20.11 24.44 -X SKELETAL ACTION ATTACK HAS BEEN DRAWN ATTENTION RECENTLY.
utt_0003 utt 24.69 30.71 -X THE CURRENT ATTACKS ON SKELETAL ACTION ARE ALL WHILE-BOX METHODS
utt_0004 utt 30.86 40.05 -X WHICH REQUIRE THE FULL-KNOWLEDGE OF THE ATTACKED MODEL, WHILE IT IS UNAVAILABLE IN THE REAL-WORLD SCENERIES.
utt_0005 utt 40.18 47.61 -X WE ARE STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER SKELETAL MOTION ATTACK IS TRULY THREATENING IN THE REAL WORLD.
utt_0006 utt 49.04 55.35 -X ADVERSARIAL ATTACK ON SKELETAL MOTIONS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM ON OTHER TYPES OF DATA.
utt_0007 utt 55.60 62.75 -X SKELETON HAS A LOW-DIMENSIONALITY COMPARING WITH IMAGES OR VIDEOS, WHICH RESTRICTS THE ATTACK.
utt_0008 utt 62.90 70.11 -X ALSO, A SKELETAL MOTION HAS DYNAMICS THAT ARE WELL-RECOGNIZED BY HUMAN PERCEPTUAL SYSTEMS.
utt_0009 utt 70.17 80.64 -X SO ANY PERTURBATION ON SINGLE JOINTS OR SINGLE FRAMES IS EASILY IDENTIFIABLE COS IT STILL CHANGES THE DYNAMICS SIGNIFICANTLY.
utt_0010 utt 80.64 87.39 -X LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES ARE GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT ONLY EXIST OFF-MANIFOLD,
utt_0011 utt 87.61 93.53 -X WHILE ON-MANIFOLD ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES ARE RATHER COMMON IN SKELETAL MOTIONS.
utt_0012 utt 93.95 103.94 -X THIS RAISES A SERIOUS CONCERN FOR HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION SOLUTIONS AS THESE ON-MANIFOLD ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES ARE IMPLEMENTABLE.
utt_0013 utt 104.83 112.03 -X FORMALLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT ADVERSARIAL ATTACK IS TRULY A THREAT TO SKELETON-BASED ACTIVITY RECOGNITION.
utt_0014 utt 112.32 118.23 -X TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE THE FIRST BLACK-BOX ATTACK ON SKELETAL ACTION RECOGNITION
utt_0015 utt 118.24 123.27 -X AND SHOW THE COMMON EXISTENCE OF ON-MANIFOLD ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES
utt_0016 utt 124.67 129.06 -X IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN THE ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES WITHIN THE MANIFOLD,
utt_0017 utt 129.09 134.44 -X WE PROPOSE A NEW ATTACK METHOD CALLED GUIDED MANIFOLD WALK.
utt_0018 utt 134.62 142.89 -X THE MAIN IDEA IS TO MODEL THE NATURAL MANIFOLD AND PROJECT THE OFF-MANIFOLD ADVERSARIAL MOTION ONTO IT.
utt_0019 utt 144.35 150.92 -X WE TEST BASAR ON THREE STATE-OF-THE-ART TARGET MODELS, ON THREE BENCHMARK DATASETS,
utt_0020 utt 151.01 157.00 -X ON TWO ATTACK STRATEGIES, AND IN COMPARISON WITH THREE ATTACK METHODS.
utt_0021 utt 157.19 166.06 -X EXCEPT REPORTING ATTACK SUCCESS RATE, WE ALSO EMPLOY five METRICS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF THE ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES
utt_0022 utt 166.53 172.46 -X AND CONDUCT THREE PERCEPTUAL STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE IMPERCEPTIBILITY
utt_0023 utt 174.76 182.54 -X BY ANALYSING BASARâ€™S ATTACK PERFORMANCE, WE FIND ALL ATTACKS HAVE one hundred% ATTACK SUCCESS RATE
utt_0024 utt 182.60 188.91 -X MORE IMPORTANTLY, BASAR CAN GENERATE AS HIGH AS ninety-nine point five five% ON-MANIFOLD ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES.
utt_0025 utt 192.07 198.51 -X IN ADDITION, THROUGH COMPARING THE ROBUSTNESS OF DIFFERENT MODELS,
utt_0026 utt 198.70 208.43 -X WE FIND MODELS EMPLOYING SEMANTIC FEATURES OR BONE-LENGTH INFORMATION WOULD GET HARDER TO FOOL.
utt_0027 utt 209.93 218.16 -X IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER METHODS, BASAR HAS THE BEST ATTACK SUCCESS RATE AND QUALITY.
utt_0028 utt 218.48 226.83 -X HOWEVER, ONLY USING NUMERICAL METRICS IS NOT ENOUGH TO EVALUATE THE IMPERCEPTIBILITY FOR SKELETAL MOTIONS,
utt_0029 utt 226.99 234.87 -X THIS IS BECAUSE FOR SKELETAL MOTIONS, SMALL PERTURBATIONS CAN STILL CAUSE LARGE DYNAMICS CHANGE.
utt_0030 utt 236.05 240.60 -X WE THUS RECRUITED fifty SUBJECTS TO CONDUCT THREE PERCEPTUAL STUDIES.
utt_0031 utt 245.17 253.49 -X IN THE DECEITFULNESS STUDY, seventy-nine point six four% OF USERS THINK BASAR VISUALLY DOES NOT CHANGE THE SEMANTICS OF THE MOTION.
utt_0032 utt 258.03 264.63 -X IN THE INDISTINGUISHABILITY STUDY, eighty-nine point nine% OF ADVERSARIAL SAMPLES CAN NOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ORIGINAL ONES.
utt_0033 utt 267.06 276.63 -X IN THE NATURALNESS STUDY, eighty-five% OF USERS THINK THE MOTIONS ATTACKED BY MANIFOLD PROJECTION LOOK MORE NATURAL.
utt_0034 utt 276.63 284.67 -X HERE IS AN ABLATION RESULT, WE CAN SEE THE ON-MANIFOLD SAMPLE IS VERY HARD TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE ORIGINAL MOTION.
utt_0035 utt 285.33 294.49 -X HERE ARE SOME COMPARISON RESULTS, WE CAN SEE BECAUSE THE CURRENT BLACK-BOX METHODS DON'T CONSIDER THE DATA MANIFOLD,
utt_0036 utt 294.49 298.62 -X THEY CAN'T BE ADAPTED TO ATTACK SKELETAL MOTIONS.
utt_0037 utt 301.14 305.63 -3.5822 THANK YOU FOR WATCHING. MORE DETAILS CAN BE FOUND THROUGH SCANNING.
