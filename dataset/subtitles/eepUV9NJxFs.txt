utt_0000 utt 2.80 15.01 -X MY NAME IS YUMING AND I'M A PHD CANDIDATE AT NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE. TODAY I'M VERY HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORK FAIRNESS ANALYSIS FOR BLOCKCHAIN INCENTIVES. THIS
utt_0002 utt 15.01 20.86 -X IS A JOINT WORK WITH TANG JING, QIAN HAO, ANDREW AND JIAN LIANG FROM HONG KONG BAPTIST UNIVERSITY
utt_0003 utt 22.73 34.64 -X IN THIS PRESENTATION, I WILL FIRST INTRODUCE YOU A ten-YEAR DEBATE IN CRYPTOCURRENCY COMMUNITY ABOUT FAIRNESS OF PROOF-OF-STAKE. THIS QUESTION MOTIVATES OUR STUDY.
utt_0005 utt 34.89 39.76 -X THEN, I WILL SHOW YOU THE UNDERLYING INCENTIVE DESIGNS OF FOUR BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS.
utt_0006 utt 40.62 48.21 -X AFTER THAT, WE ANALYZE THE FAIRNESS OF FOUR DESIGNS AND VERIFY OUR ANALYSIS BY EXPERIMENTS.
utt_0007 utt 48.85 52.72 -X FINALLY, WE CONCLUDE THE NEW KNOWLEDGE WE LEARNED FROM THIS STUDY.
utt_0008 utt 54.54 68.88 -X PERMISSIONLESS BLOCKCHAINS SUCH AS BITCOIN RELY ON DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE. THE MINER COMPETES SOME TYPE OF RESOURCE TO MAINTAIN THE LARGER AND WIN NETWORK INCENTIVES, AS EXAMPLE, THE BITCOIN.
utt_0010 utt 69.13 74.74 -X THIS COMPETITION BRINGS STRIKING ENERGY CONSUMPTION.
utt_0011 utt 75.12 89.27 -X CURRENTLY, ONLY THE BITCOIN NETWORK ITSELF CONSUMES one hundred and twenty-nine TERAWATTS HOUR ELECTRICITY PER YEAR. IT CONSUMES ten TIMES MORE THAN THE TOTAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION OF GOOGLE,
utt_0013 utt 89.27 102.20 -X THE BIGGEST TECHNOLOGY COMPANY ON THE EARTH. IT IS ALSO SURPASSES NORWAY A COUNTRY WITH five MILLION OF POPULATION AND GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE CONSUMPTION OF NEW YORK STATE.
utt_0015 utt 102.90 109.51 -X MORE SERIOUSLY, PREDICTION SAYS, IF BITCOIN PRICE CONTINUES TO GROW TO one
utt_0016 utt 109.65 116.47 -X MILLION US DOLLARS PER COIN. IT MAY BECOME THE SECOND BIGGEST ENERGY USER ON THE EARTH
utt_0017 utt 116.75 122.61 -X AND WOULD GET VERY CLOSE TO CHINA, THE COUNTRY WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION IN THE WORLD.
utt_0018 utt 123.28 128.05 -X THAT MEANS ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND URGENT ISSUE.
utt_0019 utt 130.71 134.71 -X TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE, PROOF OF STAKE WAS INVENTED.
utt_0020 utt 134.77 142.26 -X INSTEAD OF COMPETING COMPUTATIONAL POWER, PROOF OF STAKE MINERS COMPETE THEIR CRYPTOCURRENCY WEALTH.
utt_0021 utt 142.32 149.53 -X THAT MEANS PROOF OF WORK USES COMPUTATIONAL POWER TO MINE COINS BUT PROOF OF STAKE USES
utt_0022 utt 149.81 157.24 -X COINS TO MINE MORE COINS. THEREFORE OF PROOF OF STAKE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT MUCH
utt_0023 utt 157.24 165.17 -X ENERGY. IT IS FUNCTIONING VERY WELL EVEN WITH VERY LIMITED HARDWARES AND ELECTRICITY.
utt_0024 utt 165.30 171.61 -X DESPITE YOUNG AGE OF POS IT IS NOW THE SECOND POPULAR CONSENSUS ALGORITHM.
utt_0025 utt 171.92 175.29 -X MORE THAN three hundred POS COINS ARE NOW TRADING ON THE MARKET.
utt_0026 utt 178.32 192.66 -X HOWEVER CRITICS CLAIM THAT, IN PROOF OF STAKE, THE RICH MINER WOULD HAVE MORE REWARD AND FURTHER INCREASE THEIR POTENTIAL INCOME IN THE FUTURE. AND THEY BELIEVE POS OBEYS THE ORIGINAL IDEA
utt_0028 utt 192.66 207.54 -X OF DECENTRALIZATION. ON THE OTHER SIDE, POS SUPPORTERS ARGUE THAT POS SYSTEMS ARE SIMILAR TO POW BLOCKCHAINS IN DESIGN. THUS, THEY BELIEVE PROOF OF STAKE IS AS FAIR AS OTHER
utt_0030 utt 207.54 214.65 -X BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS SUCH AS BITCOIN. SUCH A DEBATE NEVER STOPPED SINCE THE BIRTH OF PROOF OF STAKE.
utt_0031 utt 217.94 223.90 -X BESIDES POLITICAL CONCERN, FAIRNESS ALSO RELATES TO SECURITY OF LARGER SYSTEMS.
utt_0032 utt 224.12 236.67 -X IF A BLOCKCHAIN INCENTIVE IS UNFAIR BY DESIGN, SOME SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WILL HAPPEN. AS A EXAMPLE, UNFAIR INCENTIVE DESIGN MAY ENCOURAGE MINING POOLS. MINERS MAY
utt_0034 utt 236.67 242.20 -X AGGREGATE THEIR POWER FOR A HIGHER PROFIT SO THE NETWORK WILL GRADUALLY BECOME CENTRALIZED.
utt_0035 utt 243.93 255.87 -X THE CENTRALIZATION MAY FURTHER MAKE THE SYSTEM VULNERABLE TO DOUBLE SPENDING OR TRANSACTION ROLLBACKS. BESIDES LARGE POOLS MAY CONTROL THE VOTING OF ON-CHAIN PROPOSALS
utt_0037 utt 255.87 263.90 -X AND CHOSES THE PROPOSAL FOR THEIR OWN GOOD AND SACRIFICE THE FAIRNESS OF THE WHOLE.
utt_0038 utt 265.11 269.76 -X VERY RECENTLY, IN AUGUST two thousand and twenty, WHICH IS FEW MONTHS BEFORE,
utt_0039 utt 269.76 284.41 -X TRANSACTION IN ETHEREUM CLASSIC WAS ROLL BACKED DUE TO fifty-one ATTACK, RESULTING IN five point six MILLION DOLLARS OF LOSS. IN THIS PAPER, WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE FAIRNESS ANALYSIS OF BLOCKCHAIN INCENTIVES.
utt_0041 utt 284.47 290.78 -X WE'RE TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND FIND SOME PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS.
utt_0042 utt 291.99 299.96 -X TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE FIRST DEFINE TWO TYPES OF FAIRNESS. THE EXPECTATIONAL FAIRNESS MEANS THAT
utt_0043 utt 299.96 308.70 -X THE EXPECTED VALUE OR THE EXPECTED INCOME OF A MINER EQUALS TO THE PROPORTIONAL OF HIS RESOURCE.
utt_0044 utt 309.30 321.92 -X THE EPSILON-DELTA FAIRNESS, OR ROBUST FAIRNESS, SAYS THAT THE INCOME OF A MINER CONCENTRATES TO ITS RESOURCE WITH HIGH PROBABILITY. THE FIRST DEFINITION,
utt_0046 utt 321.92 329.92 -X EXPECTATIONAL FAIRNESS, IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. AS FOR THE SECOND DEFINITION HERE IS AN EXAMPLE.
utt_0047 utt 331.26 338.37 -X LET'S SAY, ALICE AND BOB HAVE TWO KINDS OF INCENTIVE DESIGNS IN THE GAME. FOR ALICE,
utt_0048 utt 339.90 344.06 -X SHE WINS twenty DOLLARS FOR one hundred% PROBABILITY. BUT FOR BOB,
utt_0049 utt 344.31 354.24 -X WE REWARD HIM NOTHING WITH eighty% PROBABILITY OR PROVIDE one hundred INCENTIVES WITH twenty% PROBABILITY.
utt_0050 utt 354.62 369.47 -X OBVIOUSLY, BOTH ALICE AND BOB WILL TAKE twenty DOLLARS IN EXPECTATION, BUT THE REWARD OF BOB IS MORE UNCERTAIN. THAT MEANS ALICE FEELS MORE FAIR THAN BOB IN TERMS OF ROBUSTNESS.
utt_0052 utt 371.20 377.79 -X NOW WE ARE READY TO ANALYZE THE INCENTIVE DESIGN OF REAL BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEMS. WE FOCUSE ON POW AND
utt_0053 utt 377.95 385.38 -X VARIANCE OF POS PROTOCOLS. SPECIFICALLY, WE STUDY ETHEREUM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF POW.
utt_0054 utt 386.43 390.18 -X CONSIDERING THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIANTS OF POS IMPLEMENTATIONS.
utt_0055 utt 390.18 396.77 -X WE SELECT QTUM, ETHEREUM two AND NXT AS REPRESENTATIVES OF POS PROTOCOLS.
utt_0056 utt 400.35 404.96 -X ETHEREUM IS THE FIRST DECENTRALIZED BLOCKCHAIN WITH SMART CONTRACT FUNCTIONALITY.
utt_0057 utt 405.50 410.50 -X CURRENTLY, HE IS THE SECOND BIGGEST CRYPTOCURRENCY IN TERMS OF MARKET-CAP.
utt_0058 utt 411.20 417.03 -X ETHEREUM CHOOSES PROPOSER BY SOLVING CRYPTOGRAPHY PUZZLE LIKE BITCOIN.
utt_0059 utt 417.03 422.88 -X IF A MINER CONTROLS MORE HASH POWER, HE IS MORE LIKELY TO PROPOSE A BLOCK.
utt_0060 utt 422.88 430.56 -X THEREFORE, THE TOTAL PROFIT OF MINER COMES FROM AN INDEPENDENT AND IDENTICAL DISTRIBUTED SAMPLING,
utt_0061 utt 431.01 440.00 -X AND THE PROFIT FOLLOWS A BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION. WE SHOW THAT THE INCENTIVE DESIGN OF ETHEREUM
utt_0062 utt 440.00 448.26 -X SATISFIES BOTH TYPES OF FAIRNESS, AS LONG AS THE MINER CAN PLAY THE GAME FOR A LONG TIME.
utt_0063 utt 449.18 453.60 -X BESIDES, THE RICH MINER MAY FEEL MORE FAIR THAN POOR MINERS,
utt_0064 utt 453.60 458.37 -X SINCE THEY MAY FEEL FAIR FASTER THAN POOR MINERS.
utt_0065 utt 461.57 467.17 -X QTUM BLOCKCHAIN IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR POS PROTOCOLS. IT RANKS AROUND sixty-TH AMONG
utt_0066 utt 467.71 476.04 -X ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES. THE CONSENSUS ALGORITHM OF QTUM SIMULATES THAT OF POW. SPECIFICALLY,
utt_0067 utt 476.04 490.24 -X THE MINER USES TIMESTAMP TO SOLVE A CRYPTOGRAPHY PUZZLE. IF A MINER HAS MORE STAKES, HE IS MORE LIKELY TO SOLVE THIS PUZZLE USING A SINGLE TIMESTAMP. EVERY SECOND, THE MINER CAN CHECK
utt_0069 utt 490.24 496.52 -X THIS PUZZLE USING CURRENT TIMESTAMP AND THE FIRST MINER WHO SOLVES THIS PUZZLE WILL BE REWARDED.
utt_0070 utt 498.50 506.37 -X THE MINING PROCESS OF QTUM IS DIFFERENT TO THAT OF POW SINCE THE PROFIT IS A STOCHASTIC PROCESS.
utt_0071 utt 506.37 519.14 -X AS EXAMPLE, IF MINER A WINS A BLOCK, HE WILL WIN SOME REWARD IN THE BLOCK SO THAT HE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO MINE IN THE FOLLOWING BLOCKS. OPPOSITELY, IF HE LOSES A BLOCK,
utt_0073 utt 519.43 527.53 -X THE NEW COINS WILL DILUTE HIS COMPETITION AND HE WILL BE EVEN LESS LIKELY TO WIN IN THE FUTURE.
utt_0074 utt 528.71 542.21 -X THIS PROCESS IS ACTUALLY A POLYA URN PROCESS. ALTHOUGH, THE INCENTIVE OF QTUM IS FAIR IN EXPECTATION. THE MINING PROFIT OUTCOMES IS MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN.
utt_0076 utt 542.37 546.01 -X WE SHOW THAT A MINER CAN FEEL MORE FAIR, EITHER
utt_0077 utt 546.11 552.74 -X IF HE IS RICHER, OR HE PLAYS THE MINING GAMES LONGER, OR THE REWARD IN EACH BLOCK IS SMALLER.
utt_0078 utt 557.48 562.95 -X ETHEREUM two IS ANOTHER UPCOMING VERSION OF ETHEREUM CLIENT. IN THIS VERSION,
utt_0079 utt 562.95 576.94 -X ETHEREUM ABANDONS POW AND APPLIES POS INSTEAD. SPECIFICALLY, ETHEREUM HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES THAT DIFFERS FROM OTHER POS IMPLEMENTATIONS. FIRST, ETHEREUM two USES SHARDING
utt_0081 utt 577.54 582.86 -X SO THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PROPOSERS IN EACH BLOCK.
utt_0082 utt 582.92 589.13 -X BESIDES, THE NETWORK ALSO PROVIDES INFLATION REWARD FOR EVERYONE WHO POSSESS ETHER IN THEIR
utt_0083 utt 589.13 598.15 -X WALLET. WE SHOW THAT ETHEREUM two IS FAIR IN EXPECTATION LIKE OTHER POS PROTOCOLS,
utt_0084 utt 598.40 603.82 -X AND THE PROFIT OUTCOME MAY NOT CONCENTRATE TO THE EXPECTED VALUE WITH HIGH PROBABILITY.
utt_0085 utt 604.71 617.90 -X BUT IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT ETHEREUM two CAN BE MORE FAIR THAN QTUM PROTOCOL SINCE THE SHARDING AND INFLATION REWARD REDUCE MINING UNCERTAINTY. SPECIFICALLY, IF MORE
utt_0087 utt 617.90 624.27 -X SHARDS IN EACH BLOCK AND THE SYSTEM PROVIDES MORE INFLATION REWARD, THE MINER WILL FEEL MORE FAIR.
utt_0088 utt 628.33 636.59 -X NXT IS THE LAST PROTOCOL WE ANALYZED IN THIS WORK. IT WAS THE MOST POPULAR POS PROTOCOL IN two thousand and thirteen. TO
utt_0089 utt 638.28 645.45 -X PROPOSE A BLOCK, EACH MINER WILL BE ASSIGNED A WAITING TIME USING THE FOLLOWING EQUATION.
utt_0090 utt 645.45 656.68 -X AFTER THAT THE MINER HAVE TO WAIT TIME SECOND UNTIL THE BLOCK BECOMES VALID. THE FIRST ONE WHO SUBMITS A VALID BLOCK WINS THE INCENTIVES.
utt_0092 utt 657.26 664.96 -X WE SHOW THAT THE PROBABILITY THAT A MINER CAN WIN A BLOCK, IN FACT, DOES NOT EQUAL TO THE STAKE HE
utt_0093 utt 664.96 679.24 -X HAS. IN PARTICULAR, IF A MINER CONTROLS MORE THAN HALF OF STAKING POWER, HIS WINNING PROBABILITY IS GREATER THAN HIS POWER OPPOSITELY IF HE IS POOR, HE IS EVEN LESS LIKELY TO WIN.
utt_0095 utt 682.44 689.48 -X AN INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH FOR NXT MINERS.
utt_0096 utt 690.06 698.67 -X WE FIND THAT IF A MINER IS RICH, HIS ADVANTAGES WILL ACCUMULATE AMONG THE MINING PROCESS.
utt_0097 utt 699.05 703.34 -X OPPOSITELY, IF HE IS POOR, HIS DISADVANTAGES WILL ACCUMULATE.
utt_0098 utt 704.49 708.91 -X WE SHOW THAT, IF THE MINERS KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME REPEATEDLY
utt_0099 utt 709.29 717.13 -X WITH UNLIMITED ROUNDS THE WEALTH OF MINER WILL FINALLY CONVERGE TO zero OR one WITH PROBABILITY one.
utt_0100 utt 719.15 727.28 -X AS EXAMPLE, IF A MINER HAS thirty% WEALTH INITIALLY, IN THE MINING GAME, HIS WEALTH WILL GRADUALLY
utt_0101 utt 727.28 735.76 -X DILUTED AND FINALLY HE WILL LOSE HIS SHARE. CONVERSELY, IF A MINER CONTROLS sixty% OR seventy% WEALTH,
utt_0102 utt 736.52 746.35 -X HIS WEALTH WILL INCREASE UNTIL HE CONTROLS EVERYTHING. THEREFORE, NXT PROTOCOL DOES NOT
utt_0103 utt 746.35 752.59 -X SATISFY ANY TYPE OF FAIRNESS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, NO MATTER THE INITIAL WEALTH DISTRIBUTION,
utt_0104 utt 752.75 761.23 -X THE MINER EITHER LOSES HIS ROLES IN THE MINING PROCESS OR HE TAKES ALL OF THE MONEY. WE FEEL
utt_0105 utt 761.23 770.06 -X VERY SURPRISED AND CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED EXPERIMENTS TO PROVE THE THEORY.
utt_0106 utt 770.06 783.46 -X WE CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS AND SIMULATIONS ON AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEMS. THESE FIGURES SHOWS THE PROFIT OF A MINER ALONG WITH THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS. HERE THE BLUE SHADOW REPRESENTS SIMULATIONS AND
utt_0108 utt 783.46 788.75 -X THE GREEN BAR SHOWS SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS. WE CAN SEE THAT, THE SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS,
utt_0109 utt 788.75 794.54 -X IN FACT, OVERLAPS WITH SIMULATIONS. SO THEY VERIFY OUR THEORETICAL ANALYSIS.
utt_0110 utt 797.32 808.53 -X TO COMPARE THE SYSTEM, POW SATISFY BOTH TYPE OF FAIRNESS AND THE VARIANCE OF POS ACHIEVES EXPECTATION OF FAIRNESS BUT NOT ROBUST FAIRNESS IN GENERAL.
utt_0112 utt 808.81 818.58 -X IN PARTICULAR, NXT IS NOT FAIR UNDER ANY TYPE OF DEFINITIONS.
utt_0113 utt 819.02 826.74 -X CURRENTLY, THERE ARE MORE THAN three hundred CRYPTOCURRENCIES USING PROOF OF STAKE AND ITS VARIANCE. SO HOW FAIR ARE THEY?
utt_0115 utt 827.28 835.19 -X WE COMPARE THE POS BLOCKCHAINS INSIDE THE TOP fifty RANKS IN TERMS OF MARKET CAP.
utt_0116 utt 836.85 844.95 -X NEO APPLIES A DUAL TOKEN POS MODEL THAT DIFFERS FROM CLASSICAL POS IMPLEMENTATIONS. MINERS DEPOSIT
utt_0117 utt 844.95 852.66 -X NEO TOKEN AS STAKES AND COMPETES TO WIN ANOTHER TOKEN NAMED NEO GAS. THIS MODEL, IN FACT,
utt_0118 utt 852.66 859.89 -X IS VERY SIMILAR TO POW INCENTIVE. THUS, NEO PROTOCOL ACHIEVES BOTH TYPE OF FAIRNESS LIKE POW.
utt_0119 utt 862.29 877.01 -X ALGORAND CURRENTLY RANKS AT fortyTH AMONG ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES. IT PROVIDES AN INFLATION REWARD AND NO PROPOSER REWARD. THUS, THIS PROTOCOL IS OBVIOUSLY FAIR AND HAVE NO MINING UNCERTAINTY.
utt_0121 utt 877.74 883.92 -X HOWEVER, HIS MECHANISM MAY DISCOURAGE MINERS SINCE NO PROPOSER REWARD PROVIDED.
utt_0122 utt 886.32 894.90 -X EOS WAS THE MOST POPULAR DELEGATED POS CRYPTOCURRENCY IN two thousand and thirteen. IT HAS FAIRNESS ISSUE
utt_0123 utt 895.25 902.33 -X LIKE NXT SINCE THE PROPOSER REWARD IS A CONSTANT FOR EVERY DELEGATES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR WEALTH.
utt_0124 utt 907.41 921.43 -X ANOTHER INTERESTING QUESTION IS HOW TO IMPROVE FAIRNESS OF INCENTIVES. WE FURTHER PROPOSE SOME TREATMENTS ON BOTH NXT AND QTUM, BASED ON OUR THEORETICAL ANALYSIS.
utt_0126 utt 921.43 935.78 -X FIRST, THE MONOPOLIZATION IN NXT IS CAUSED BY AN UNFAIR TIME FUNCTION. THEREFORE, WE REFINE THE TIME FUNCTION USING PROBABILITY AND ENSURE THE PROPOSER SELECTION IS FAIR IN EACH BLOCK. THE
utt_0128 utt 935.78 945.75 -X FIGURE SHOWS THE INCENTIVES OF NXT PROTOCOL AFTER REFINEMENT AND NOW IT CAN BE FAIR IN EXPECTATION.
utt_0129 utt 945.75 955.16 -X IN NEXT STEP, HOW COULD WE REDUCE THE MINING UNCERTAINTY THROUGH MECHANISM DESIGN. WE PROPOSE TWO TREATMENTS THAT HELP REDUCING SUCH UNCERTAINTY,
utt_0131 utt 957.11 971.42 -X ONE OF THE SOLUTION IS ADJUSTING BLOCK REWARD. THE SYSTEM MAY REDUCE THE REWARD IN EACH BLOCK AND AT THE SAME TIME PROPOSE NEW BLOCKS MORE FREQUENTLY. THEN THE SYSTEM IS MORE LIKELY TO BE FAIR.
utt_0133 utt 972.47 977.14 -X THE OTHER SOLUTION IS WITHHOLDING BLOCK PERIODICALLY.
utt_0134 utt 977.14 983.61 -X AS EXAMPLE, THE SYSTEM WITHHOLD THE REWARD OF NEW BLOCKS AND RELEASE THEM EVERY one hundred BLOCKS.
utt_0135 utt 984.60 997.02 -X AS A RESULT, EVERY TIME THE SYSTEM RELEASE BLOCKS, THE REWARD OBTAINED BY MINER APPROXIMATES TO THE POWER OF THEM AND THE SYSTEM IS MORE LIKELY TO BE FAIR.
utt_0137 utt 998.81 1003.48 -X THE FIGURE COMPARES NXT CLIENT WITH EXPECTATION REFINEMENT AND
utt_0138 utt 1003.54 1009.37 -X WITHHOLDING TREATMENT. WE CAN SEE THAT NXT WITHHOLDING PERFORMS MUCH BETTER.
utt_0139 utt 1012.89 1017.50 -X FINALLY, WHAT ELSE WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS WORK?
utt_0140 utt 1017.50 1031.67 -X BESIDES COMPUTATION RESOURCE, IN FACT, POS AND POW DIFFER IN MANY RESPECTS. THE MINING PROCESS OF POW IS I.I.D. SAMPLING. BUT IN POS, THE MINING PROCESS IS A STOCHASTIC PROCESS.
utt_0142 utt 1033.56 1042.97 -X FOR POW, THE MINING PROFIT IS LESS UNCERTAIN BUT THE MORE UNCERTAINTY IN POS MINING.
utt_0143 utt 1042.97 1049.76 -X MORE IMPORTANTLY, IF THE INCENTIVE DESIGN IS NOT FAIR OR THERE EXISTS AN ATTACKER IN THE NETWORK,
utt_0144 utt 1049.85 1058.14 -X THE DISADVANTAGE OR ADVANTAGE IN POW IS INDEPENDENT TO THE MINING PROCESS. AND THUS THE
utt_0145 utt 1058.14 1066.91 -X ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE IS A CONSTANT. HOWEVER SUCH, ADVANTAGES MAY ACCUMULATE IN POS. EVEN
utt_0146 utt 1066.91 1073.34 -X WORSE, THE ATTACKER MAY FINALLY MANIPULATE THE NETWORK IF HE ATTACKS THE NETWORK FOR A LONG TIME.
utt_0147 utt 1077.11 1081.44 -X TO CONCLUDE OUR PAPER, WE MADE THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTIONS.
utt_0148 utt 1081.44 1091.84 -X WE DEFINED TWO TYPES OF FAIRNESS: THE EXPECTATIONAL FAIRNESS AND ROBUST FAIRNESS. BASED ON THESE TWO DEFINITIONS, WE ANALYZED THE FAIRNESS OF POW AND THREE
utt_0150 utt 1093.24 1100.48 -X POS VARIANTS. AFTER THAT, WE DISCUSSED HOW TO IMPROVE FAIRNESS USING PRACTICAL TREATMENTS.
utt_0151 utt 1101.66 1107.33 -X CONSIDERING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF NEW PROTOCOLS ARE INVENTED, WE ANALYZE THE FAIRNESS OF MORE
utt_0152 utt 1107.33 1116.96 -X PROTOCOLS. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS THE PRACTICALITY OF FAIRNESS. WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO DATA RELIABILITY
utt_0153 utt 1116.96 1122.46 -X AND INTEGRITY? HOW IT PREVENTS MINING POOLS AND THE INSPIRATIONS FOR SECURITY.
utt_0154 utt 1123.99 1132.57 -5.1786 THAT'S EVERYTHING IN MY TALK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST.
