utt_0000 utt 0.43 7.12 -X IN THIS TALK, WE PRESENT BALANCING DISCRIMINABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY FOR SOURCE-FREE DOMAIN ADAPTATION.
utt_0002 utt 7.12 13.52 -X WE DEAL WITH DOMAIN ADAPTATION, WHERE KNOWLEDGE HAS TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM A LABELED SOURCE DOMAIN TO AN UNLABELED TARGET DOMAIN.
utt_0004 utt 14.22 16.53 -X WE BEGIN WITH PRELIMINARIES.
utt_0005 utt 16.53 24.02 -X DISCRIMINABILITY IS THE EASE OF SEPARATING DIFFERENT TASK-CATEGORIES WITH A SUPERVISED CLASSIFIER AND TRANSFERABILITY IS DOMAIN-INVARIANCE OF FEATURES.
utt_0007 utt 24.05 28.47 -X FOR EXAMPLE, ASSUME THAT COLOR REPRESENTS DOMAIN AND SHAPE REPRESENTS CLASS.
utt_0008 utt 28.56 33.88 -X HIGH DOMAIN SEPARABILITY YIELDS LOW TRANSFERABILITY AS FEATURES LACK DOMAIN-INVARIANCE.
utt_0009 utt 33.88 40.28 -X WHILE HIGH CLASS CONFUSION YIELDS LOW DISCRIMINABILITY AS CLASSES CANNOT BE SEPARATED BY A SUPERVISED CLASSIFIER.
utt_0011 utt 40.37 43.13 -X BASED ON THIS, WE GET THE OTHER COMBINATIONS.
utt_0012 utt 43.13 46.14 -X THE FINAL CASE WHERE BOTH ARE HIGH, IS DESIRABLE FOR DA.
utt_0013 utt 47.09 49.62 -X NOW, WE DISCUSS THE TRADEOFF.
utt_0014 utt 49.62 54.74 -X REMOVING DOMAIN-SPECIFICITY FOR BETTER TRANSFERABILITY USUALLY REMOVES ENTANGLED TASK-SPECIFICITY,
utt_0015 utt 54.77 56.66 -X WHICH HURTS DISCRIMINABILITY.
utt_0016 utt 56.72 59.19 -X THUS, IMPROVING ONE HURTS THE OTHER.
utt_0017 utt 59.19 69.53 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IN SEGMENTATION DA, CONTOURS BOOST TRANSFERABILITY BUT HURT DISCRIMINABILITY AS TASK-RELEVANT COLOR-TEXTURE ARE LOST, WHICH HURTS ADAPTATION.
utt_0019 utt 70.39 73.44 -X NOW WE ASK, CAN WE STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THEM?
utt_0020 utt 73.50 81.72 -X PRIOR WORKS PROPOSE MODIFIED ADVERSARIAL DA TOWARDS THIS, BUT REQUIRE CONCURRENT ACCESS TO BOTH SOURCE AND TARGET DATA.
utt_0022 utt 81.72 85.66 -X THESE ARE UNSUITABLE FOR A SOURCE-FREE SETTING WHERE DATA-SHARING IS RESTRICTED.
utt_0023 utt 85.72 93.89 -X WE OPERATE IN A VENDOR-CLIENT PARADIGM WHERE VENDOR TRAINS A MODEL WITH LABELED SOURCE DATA, AND SHARES ONLY THE SOURCE-MODEL WITH THE CLIENT FOR ADAPTATION.
utt_0025 utt 94.75 96.99 -X NOW, WE DISCUSS OUR KEY INSIGHTS.
utt_0026 utt 96.99 100.19 -X FIRST, WE ANALYZE PRIOR DG AND SOURCE-FREE DA WORKS.
utt_0027 utt 100.19 105.22 -X MOST SFDA WORKS FOCUS ON PRESERVING DISCRIMINABILITY WITHOUT LABELED SOURCE DATA.
utt_0028 utt 105.22 110.05 -X WHEREAS, MOST DG WORKS FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING TRANSFERABILITY WITHOUT TARGET DATA.
utt_0029 utt 111.01 115.71 -X A NATURAL QUESTION ARISES, WHY IS STRIKING A BALANCE CRUCIAL IN SOURCE-FREE DA?
utt_0030 utt 115.71 120.58 -X UNDER SOURCE-FREE, DISCRIMINABILITY CAN ONLY BE GATHERED WITH LABELED SOURCE DATA.
utt_0031 utt 120.93 127.43 -X THUS, THE TRADEOFF BECOMES MORE SEVERE AS DISCRIMINABILITY CANNOT BE PRESERVED WITH ONLY UNLABELED DATA.
utt_0033 utt 127.43 132.42 -X AN EXPLICIT EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE TRADEOFF, OPERATING IN THE GREEN REGION, CAN BENEFIT SFDA.
utt_0035 utt 133.31 137.41 -X NOW, WHAT ARE THE KEY DESIGN ASPECTS TO IMPROVE THE TRADEOFF IN SFDA?
utt_0036 utt 137.70 144.68 -X A NAIVE SOLUTION IS TO TRANSLATE SOURCE AND TARGET TO A GENERIC DOMAIN WITH HIGH TRANSFERABILITY AND DISCRIMINABILITY.
utt_0038 utt 144.99 148.20 -X BUT SUCH TRANSLATIONS LEAD TO A LOSS OF DISCRIMINABILITY.
utt_0039 utt 148.48 155.14 -X THUS, TO STRIKE A BALANCE, WE PROPOSE MIXUP BETWEEN ORIGINAL AND CORRESPONDING GENERIC-DOMAIN TRANSLATED SAMPLES.
utt_0041 utt 157.44 159.05 -X NOW WE MOVE TO OUR APPROACH.
utt_0042 utt 159.21 163.02 -X AN OBVIOUS QUESTION, HOW TO OBTAIN GENERIC-DOMAIN SAMPLES?
utt_0043 utt 163.02 166.47 -X A REALIZABLE GENERIC-DOMAIN MUST HAVE HIGH TRANSFERABILITY.
utt_0044 utt 166.47 170.35 -X BASED ON THIS, WE PROPOSE TWO GENERIC-DOMAIN TRANSLATION METHODS.
utt_0045 utt 172.20 175.21 -X FIRST, EDGES CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH CONTOUR ESTIMATION.
utt_0046 utt 175.40 181.42 -X INTUITIVELY, THEY PRESERVE THE SHAPE AND REMOVE THE DOMAIN-DEPENDENT COLOR AND TEXTURE.
utt_0047 utt 181.90 189.33 -X SECOND, A FEATURE-SPACE GENERIC REPRESENTATION WHERE TASK-PRESERVING IMAGE AUGMENTATIONS SIMULATE NOVEL SUB-DOMAINS.
utt_0049 utt 189.45 196.59 -X AND THE AUGMENTED FEATURE MEAN DIFFUSES THE DOMAIN-VARIANCE AND IS USED AS THE GENERIC-DOMAIN FEATURE.
utt_0051 utt 198.16 200.11 -X NEXT, HOW TO PERFORM MIXUP?
utt_0052 utt 200.24 204.98 -X AS PER OUR INSIGHTS, WE MIXUP THE ORIGINAL AND CORRESPONDING GENERIC-DOMAIN SAMPLES.
utt_0053 utt 205.00 210.39 -X A SIMPLE CONVEX COMBINATION WITH A FIXED MIXUP RATIO WORKS WELL AND VALIDATES OUR INSIGHTS.
utt_0054 utt 211.25 213.84 -X NOW WE DISCUSS THE TRAINING ALGORITHM.
utt_0055 utt 213.84 217.49 -X OUR APPROACH CAN BE COMBINED WITH ANY EXISTING SFDA WORK.
utt_0056 utt 217.49 226.80 -X ASSUME A VENDOR-SIDE ALGORITHM VS ALGO THAT USES THE ORIGINAL SOURCE DATASET D_S AND A CLIENT-SIDE ALGORITHM CS ALGO THAT USES THE ORIGINAL TARGET DATA D_T.
utt_0058 utt 227.02 232.40 -X FOR TRAINING, WE SIMPLY USE OUR PROPOSED MIXUP DATASETS D_S_M AND D_T_M AS SHOWN.
utt_0059 utt 233.78 236.76 -X NEXT, WE ILLUSTRATE OUR KEY QUANTITATIVE RESULTS.
utt_0060 utt 237.27 242.68 -X WE EVALUATE SINGLE SOURCE DA, ON OFFICEminus thirty-one AND VISDA BENCHMARKS AND OBSERVE CONSISTENT GAINS.
utt_0062 utt 243.57 249.37 -X FOR CLASSIFICATION, FEATURE-MIXUP CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORMS EDGE-MIXUP AND PRODUCES SOTA RESULTS.
utt_0063 utt 250.42 256.06 -X WE ALSO EVALUATE SEGMENTATION DA AND OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT GAINS OVER ALL SETTINGS.
utt_0064 utt 256.18 261.37 -X HERE, EDGE-MIXUP OUTPERFORMS FEATURE-MIXUP AS IT BETTER SUITS DENSE PREDICTION.
utt_0065 utt 263.06 267.23 -X HERE, WE PRESENT QUALITATIVE RESULTS FOR SINGLE SOURCE AND MULTI-SOURCE DA.
utt_0066 utt 267.23 270.81 -X OUR ADAPTED MODEL GENERALIZES BETTER THAN THE PRIOR SOTA.
utt_0067 utt 271.25 279.12 -X IN SUMMARY, WE ANALYZE PRIOR DG AND SOURCE-FREE DA WORKS AND FIND THAT SFDA PRIORITIZES DISCRIMINABILITY
utt_0068 utt 279.38 281.79 -X WHILE DG PRIORITIZES TRANSFERABILITY.
utt_0069 utt 282.20 292.00 -X CONVERSELY, WE SEEK A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO, AND PROPOSE MIXUP OF DISCRIMINABLE ORIGINAL SAMPLES AND CORRESPONDING TRANSFERABLE GENERIC-DOMAIN SAMPLES.
utt_0071 utt 292.67 298.30 -X FINALLY, WE ACHIEVE GAINS OVER THE SOTA WITH FASTER CONVERGENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE SETTINGS AND TASKS.
utt_0073 utt 298.65 302.11 -X PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAPER AND PROJECT PAGE FOR MORE DETAILS.
utt_0074 utt 302.11 303.07 -1.4447 THANK YOU.
