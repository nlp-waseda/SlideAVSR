utt_0000 utt 3.28 8.59 -X HI EVERYBODY AND THANKS FOR JOINING OUR TALK ON SPEED KIT, A POLYGLOT AND GDPR-
utt_0001 utt 8.59 11.86 -X COMPLIANT APPROACH FOR CACHING PERSONALIZED CONTENT
utt_0002 utt 11.98 20.59 -X I'M WOLLE FROM THE GERMAN COMPANY BAQEND AND TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT OUR SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE THAT WE BUILT FOR ACCELERATING ECOMMERCE AND OTHER
utt_0004 utt 20.59 31.35 -X WEBSITES. SO LET'S GET STARTED ... HELLO!? ERRR ... PRESENTATION IS LOADING ... JUST A SECOND ...
utt_0005 utt 31.35 42.42 -X SHOULD BE READY ... LIKE ... AH, THERE YOU GO! OKAY, THAT WAS A PRETTY LAME JOKE I ADMIT IT BUT IT SERVES A PURPOSE NAMELY ILLUSTRATING THAT NOBODY REALLY LIKES
utt_0007 utt 42.42 56.64 -X WAITING AND EVERYBODY SURFS AROUND three point five HOURS EVERY DAY AND WAITS twenty MINUTES OF THOSE THREE AND A HALF HOURS JUST FOR STUFF TO HAPPEN THAT'S ANNOYING AND COSTS AS MUCH AS ONE YEAR OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
utt_0010 utt 62.48 67.23 -X NOT ONLY ANNOYING IT'S ALSO A REAL BUSINESS PROBLEM SO AMAZON FAMOUSLY SAID
utt_0011 utt 67.25 76.56 -X THAT one hundred MILLISECONDS OF LOST PAGE LOAD TIME COST THEM ABOUT one% OF CONVERSION RATE SO AT THEIR SIZE THAT'S ABOUT one BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR
utt_0013 utt 77.04 91.92 -X CONVERSELY ZALANDO THE GERMAN AMAZON FOR SHOES FOUND THAT ACCELERATING THEIR WEBSITE BY one hundred MILLISECONDS BROUGHT ABOUT zero point seven% OF REVENUE PER SESSION AND WALMART SIMILARLY FOUND THAT one hundred MILLISECONDS OF FASTER PAGE LOADS BRING
utt_0016 utt 91.92 102.45 -X THEM ONE PERCENT IN OVERALL REVENUE AND THE REASON WHY PAGE SPEED PLAYS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR REVENUE IS THAT IT ALSO IS AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF USER
utt_0018 utt 102.45 113.46 -X SATISFACTION SO STUDIES FOUND THAT EVERYTHING REGARDING THE USER INTERFACE DELAY UP UNTIL one hundred MILLISECONDS IS PERCEIVED AS INSTANT AND EVERYTHING UP
utt_0020 utt 113.62 118.98 -X UNTIL three hundred MILLISECONDS IS STILL VERY GOOD EVERYTHING UNTIL ONE SECOND IS
utt_0021 utt 119.02 131.75 -X QUITE OK BUT IF YOU GO BEYOND THAT PEOPLE JUST START THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE YOU KNOW THERE'S A MENTAL CONTEXT SWITCH AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE JUST DROP OUT OF WHAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING SO IF YOU HAVE AN ONLINE BUSINESS
utt_0024 utt 131.75 141.59 -X YOUR GOAL SHOULD BE STAY UNDER one thousand MILLISECONDS TO KEEP THE USERS ATTENTION AND IT ALSO MEANS THAT PAGE SPEED IS MONEY IF YOUR BUSINESS IS IN THE
utt_0026 utt 141.59 152.41 -X INTERNET THIS PROBLEM IS MORE RELEVANT TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE DUE TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC CURRENTLY LIFE IS BASICALLY TAKING PLACE ONLINE AND
utt_0028 utt 152.41 160.37 -X OVERALL TRAFFIC INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE EXPERIENCING SEVERE DROPS IN WEB SPEED ALL OVER THE WORLD
utt_0030 utt 161.81 171.99 -X BUT EVEN THOUGH COVIDminus nineteen MAY MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE THE BASIC PROBLEMS ARE THE SAME AS ALWAYS SO FIRST WE HAVE BACK-END PROCESSING FOR ASSEMBLING DATA
utt_0032 utt 171.99 186.87 -X AND RENDERING AN HTML IN THE SERVER AND THEN TRANSFERRING THAT TO THE CLIENT THAT MAY TAKE A WHILE IF THE SERVER AND THE CLIENT ARE FAR APART AND EVEN IF THE DATA ARRIVES FAST THE CLIENT STILL HAS TO RENDER EVERYTHING WHICH MAY ALSO TAKE
utt_0035 utt 186.87 200.44 -X ITS SWEET TIME WE AT BAQEND HAVE MADE IT OUR MISSION TO RESOLVE THESE BOTTLENECKS WE'RE A RESEARCH-BASED SPIN-UP FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF HAMBURG THAT IS CENTERED AROUND CACHING UNCACHEABLE DATA AND WE CARRY OUR RESEARCH INTO
utt_0038 utt 200.44 215.18 -X PRACTICE THROUGH SPEED KIT A SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE FOR ACCELERATING ECOMMERCE WEBSITES SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW SPEED KIT WORKS IN DETAIL WHEN A WEB SITE LOADS NORMALLY THE BROWSER JUST REQUEST SOMETHING FROM THE ORIGIN SERVER AND
utt_0041 utt 215.18 225.11 -X THEN WAITS FOR THE RESPONSE WITH SPEED KID THIS IS ACCELERATED BY A CACHING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NOT ONLY EXPLOITS CDNS BUT ALSO THE LOCAL CACHES IN THE
utt_0043 utt 225.11 234.97 -X BROWSER SO IN THE USER DEVICE AND IT'S DIFFERENT FROM CDN CACHING BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE A SMART CLIENT PROXYING WITHIN THE BROWSER SO A SERVICEWORKER PROCESS
utt_0045 utt 235.00 244.94 -X THAT CAN DECIDE WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO ASK THE ORIGIN OR WHETHER THE SAME DATA CAN BE DELIVERED FASTER FROM OUR CACHING INFRASTRUCTURE IN DOING
utt_0047 utt 244.94 254.47 -X SO WE OF COURSE EXCLUDE RESOURCES THAT WE CANNOT POSSIBLY CACHE FOR EXAMPLE TRACKING OR ADD SERVICES AND WE ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IN OUR CACHES IS
utt_0049 utt 254.71 269.69 -X SYNCHRONIZED WITH THE ORIGINAL CONTENT AND THESE THIS IS BASICALLY THE MAIN CHALLENGE HERE AND YOU COULD BREAK IT DOWN TO TWO PROBLEMS SO FIRST WE HAVE TO DETECT CONTENT UPDATES AND THEN WE HAVE TO PROPAGATE THESE CONTENT CHANGES TO
utt_0052 utt 269.69 280.03 -X THE CLIENTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT ON THE NEXT SLIDES SO THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS DETECTING CONTENT CHANGES AND WE DO THAT VIA
utt_0054 utt 280.03 290.25 -X REVALIDATION JOBS AND A REVALIDATION JOB SPECIFIES WHAT KIND OF CONTENT SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR CHANGES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD SAY TAKE ALL THE HTML FILES AND
utt_0056 utt 290.25 301.02 -X THEN YOU CAN TRIGGER THAT EITHER MANUALLY OR VIA CRON JOBS AND WHAT THIS REVALIDATION JOB HERE DOES IS IT QUERIES ALL THE HTML FILES THAT ARE CURRENTLY
utt_0058 utt 301.02 311.26 -X CACHED AND COMPARES THEM WITH THE CACHED VERSION SO YOU HOLD THE ORIGINAL VERSION FROM THE WEBSITE AGAINST THE ONE WE HAVE CACHED AND ONLY THOSE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY
utt_0060 utt 311.26 324.81 -X CHANGED ARE INVALIDATED IN THE CDN AND WE ALSO TRANSPORT THAT INFORMATION AND THAT'S THE NEXT CHALLENGE ON THE NEXT SLIDE TO THE CLIENT SO THAT EXPLORATION BASED CACHES SUCH AS THE BROWSER CACHE ARE ALSO AVOIDED WHENEVER
utt_0063 utt 324.81 335.21 -X RESOURCE HAS CHANGED TO ILLUSTRATE THE SECOND CHALLENGE LET'S LOOK AT A SIMPLE EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A USER VISITING A PRODUCT PAGE AND THEN THE HTML IS LOADED
utt_0065 utt 335.21 347.26 -X AND DELIVERED THROUGH A HIERARCHY OF CACHES SO NOW THE USER SEES THE HTML AND ITS LOCAL BROWSER CACHE AND THE INVALIDATION BASE CACHE SO THE CN HAVE
utt_0067 utt 347.80 358.96 -X THE HTML WITH A FIXED TIME TO LIVE SAY A DAY OR SO BUT NOW AN HOUR LATER SO STILL WITHIN THE TTL A DIFFERENT USER BUYS THE PRODUCT AND THEREBY INVALIDATES THE HTML
utt_0069 utt 358.96 369.81 -X SO NOW ALL THE DATA THAT THE OTHER USER SAW BEFORE HAS BECOME STALE BUT WE I MEAN WE CAN BY REVALIDATION DETECT THIS UPDATE BUT WE CAN ONLY INVALIDATE THE
utt_0071 utt 369.81 374.46 -X CDN AND THE EXPIRATION BASED BROWSER CACHE WOULD STILL RETURN THE STALE
utt_0072 utt 374.75 381.74 -X RESOURCE HERE TO TELL THE USER SO THE THE SPEED KIT CLIENT PROXY BASICALLY
utt_0073 utt 381.76 394.00 -X THAT THE EXPLORATION BASED CACHE HAS TO BE AVOIDED WE APPLY A TRICK AND THE TRICK IS THAT WE STORE THE UPDATED THE UPDATED HTML FILE IN A SERVER DATA
utt_0075 utt 394.00 407.84 -X STRUCTURE CALLED THE CACHE SKETCH SO THAT'S IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND THEN WE TRANSPORT THAT EVERY thirty SECONDS BY DEFAULT TO ALL CLIENTS SO THAT BEFORE LOADING A PAGE THE THE SPEED CLIENT PROXY CAN MAKE A LOOKUP WEATHER
utt_0078 utt 407.84 422.59 -X THE RESOURCE THAT IS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE BROWSER CACHE IS ACTUALLY FRESH OR NOT AND IF THIS TEST DETERMINES THAT THE RESOURCE SHOULD OR COULD BE STALE THEN IT'S JUST AVOIDED AND THE BROWSER CACHE IS NOT USED BUT INSTEAD THE CDN IS USED
utt_0081 utt 422.59 433.06 -X AND THIS GIVES US DATA AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE NEVER DELIVER DATA THAT IS OLDER THAN thirty SECONDS SO THIS SHOWS HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE
utt_0083 utt 433.06 442.85 -X NEVER DELIVER STALE CONTENT FROM OUR CACHES BUT ACCELERATING WEBSITES IS STILL CHALLENGING BECAUSE THE HTML FILE WHICH IS PIVOTAL FOR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE
utt_0085 utt 442.85 453.19 -X EVERY OTHER RESOURCE IS LINKED IN THERE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCELERATE SINCE IT'S PERSONALIZED TYPICALLY SO WHAT WE DO IS WE CONFIGURE SPEED KIT IN SUCH A
utt_0087 utt 453.19 463.86 -X WAY THAT IT KNOWS WHICH PORTIONS OF THE WEBSITE ARE PERSONALIZED FOR EXAMPLE THE THE HELLO CUSTOMER BADGE OR THE NUMBER OF ITEMS IN YOUR SHOPPING CART AND THEN
utt_0089 utt 463.86 472.90 -X SPEAK IT DELIVERS AN ANONYMOUS VERSION OF THE WEBSITE IMMEDIATELY FROM THE FROM THE CACHES SO VERY FAST AND IN THE BACKGROUND LOADS THE PERSONALIZED
utt_0091 utt 472.90 483.81 -X VERSION OF THE WEBSITE SO FOR THE LOGGED IN USER SO THAT WE CAN PATCH IN THE PERSONALIZED PORTIONS LATER SO IF YOU HOLD THAT SIDE BY SIDE YOU SEE THAT THE
utt_0093 utt 483.81 488.18 -X ANONYMOUS VERSION AND THE PERSONALIZED VERSION OF THE SAME WEBSITE TYPICALLY
utt_0094 utt 488.45 498.24 -X LOOK VERY SIMILAR SO THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH DISRUPTION IN YOUR USER EXPERIENCE IF YOU JUST SAY SEE THE ANONYMOUS VERSION FIRST AND THE PERSONALIZED
utt_0096 utt 498.24 508.42 -X VERSION LATER BUT IT'S REALLY RELEVANT FOR ACCELERATION SO IN A NUTSHELL WE LOAD THE ANONYMOUS AND FAST VERSION OF A WEBSITE FROM THE VERY FAST SPEED KEED
utt_0098 utt 508.42 523.25 -X CACHES AND JUST FETCH THE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION FROM THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM AND PATCH IT IN LATER GDPR WISE THIS IS AN AWESOME CONCEPT BECAUSE WE DO NOT PROCESS ANY KIND OF SENSITIVE USER INFORMATION
utt_0101 utt 523.25 533.64 -X YOU KNOW THE PATCHING TOGETHER IS DONE WITHIN THE BROWSER SO ON THE USER DEVICE AND ALL THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL OR OR PRIVATE IN ANY WAY IS STORED ARE THE
utt_0103 utt 533.64 548.60 -X ORIGINAL SHOP SYSTEM AND STILL WE CAN ACCELERATE CONTENT DELIVERY AND THE KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY HERE IS SERVED WORKERS SO WITH THE NORMAL WEBSITE THE BROWSER TAB JUST FIRES UP A REQUEST AGAINST NETWORK AND THEN WAIT FOR THE
utt_0106 utt 548.60 559.14 -X RESPONSE AND WITH SPEED KIT WE HAVE THE SMART CLIENT PROXY SITTING IN THE MIDDLE SO THAT'S A SERVICE WORKER PROCESS THAT INTERCEPTS ALL HTTP REQUESTS THAT ARE
utt_0108 utt 559.14 570.21 -X GOING OUT AND THEN CAN DECIDE WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY SERVED SO THAT WHETHER THE RESPONSE IS ACTUALLY SERVED BY THE BY THE REQUESTED ORIGIN OR FOR EXAMPLE BY
utt_0110 utt 570.21 581.22 -X THE CACHE AND THAT AS I JUST EXPLAINED SERVES AS A MECHANISM FOR ACCELERATION BUT ALSO CAN BE USED TO IMPLEMENT OFFLINE CAPABILITY SO IT ESSENTIALLY
utt_0112 utt 581.22 595.27 -X TURNS YOUR OFF-THE-SHELF WEBSITE INTO A PROGRESSIVE WEB APP AND ONE THING THAT IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL HERE IS THAT SPEED KIT CAN REROUTE REQUESTS TO
utt_0114 utt 595.30 606.41 -X DIFFERENT ORIGINS SO USUALLY FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY LIBRARIES IN YOUR WEBSITE LIKE THE GOOGLE ANALYTICS OR THE FACEBOOK SDKS THEN THESE
utt_0116 utt 606.41 620.49 -X RESOURCES ARE SERVED OVER COLD AND SLOW CONNECTIONS AND THAT REALLY SLOWS DOWN YOUR WEBSITE AS WELL BUT WITH SPEED KICK YOU CAN JUST SERVE THESE RESOURCES OVER THE SPEED KEED CDN YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH ANY OTHER CDN BECAUSE THEY DO NOT
utt_0119 utt 620.49 624.49 -X HOOK INTO THE REQUEST WEEDING IN TO INSIDE THE BROWSER
utt_0120 utt 626.34 630.86 -X ADD ANOTHER THING THAT JUST COMES BY DEFAULT HERE IS THAT WE CAN APPLY
utt_0121 utt 630.98 641.80 -X ON-THE-FLY OPTIMIZATIONS TO RESOURCES SUCH AS IMAGES SO FOR EXAMPLE WE OPTIMIZE JPEGS TO WEBP II WHENEVER THE BROWSER SUPPORTS THAT AND THAT BY JUST
utt_0123 utt 641.80 648.01 -X REDUCED THE PAYLOAD OF SERVED IMAGE IMAGES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE QUALITY
utt_0124 utt 649.73 664.30 -X AND THIS IS VERY RELIABLE BECAUSE MORE THAN ninety% OF ALL USERS USE BROWSERS THAT SUPPORT SERVICE WORKERS AND EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN OLD BROWSER THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT SERVICE WORKERS THEN THE WEBSITE IS SERVED AS USUAL SO YOU DON'T REALLY
utt_0127 utt 664.49 675.26 -X HAVE DEGRADING EFFECTS THERE IT'S JUST BETTER WHEN YOU HAVE A SERVICEWORKER BROWSER AND IT'S JUST THE VANILLA WEBSITE EXPERIENCE ELSE TO REALLY GET
utt_0129 utt 675.26 684.84 -X THE BEST POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WE INTEGRATED A REAL USER MONITORING INTO SPEED KIT SO THAT WE CAN TRACK AND MONITOR PERFORMANCE METRICS
utt_0131 utt 684.84 699.32 -X LIKE THE TIME TO RESPITE OR VARIOUS BROWSER TIMINGS BUT ALSO USER ENGAGEMENT METRICS AND BUSINESS KPIS SO IF WE HAVE AN ONLINE SHOP FOR EXAMPLE WE CONFIGURE SPEED KIT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY A CONVERSION IS AND THEN WE CAN
utt_0134 utt 699.32 708.24 -X TELL YOU WHETHER YOUR USER SETTING CONVERSION RATE IS GOING UP OR NOT AND WE CAN ALSO YEAH MONITOR ALL KINDS OF MISTAKES AND ERRORS THAT HAPPEN SO WE
utt_0136 utt 708.26 713.68 -X CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE WEBSITE BECAUSE WE HAVE BUILT-IN QA AS
utt_0137 utt 713.70 723.88 -X WELL THERE AND WHAT WE DO HERE IS ESSENTIALLY WE DO SPLIT TESTING FOR WEB PERFORMANCE AND THIS IS VERY NEAT FEATURE BECAUSE NO
utt_0139 utt 723.88 733.12 -X OTHER CDN SOLUTION CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT BECAUSE CD ENDS ARE ALWAYS ONLY ON OR OFF SO YOU CAN ONLY COMPARE PERFORMANCE IN A BEFORE AFTER A FASHION
utt_0141 utt 733.12 747.73 -X BUT WITH SPEED KIT YOU CAN ENABLE SPEED KIT SINCE IT'S JAVASCRIPT BASED FOR ONLY A PORTION OF ALL USERS AND THEN YOU CAN SAY OKAY LET'S COMPARE SPEED KEED USERS AND NORMAL USERS AT THE SAME TIME ON THE WEBSITE AND COLLECT TRACKING DATA FOR
utt_0144 utt 747.73 756.88 -X BOTH OF THESE USER GROUPS AND THEN COMPUTE THE UPLIFT PERFORMANCE WISE BUT ALSO IN SESSION LENGTHS AND OTHER USER ENGAGEMENT METRICS BUSINESS SUCCESS AND
utt_0146 utt 756.88 771.57 -X ULTIMATELY THE MONEY THAT YOU ARE MAKING BY USING SPEED KIT TO ILLUSTRATE THE GAINS OF OUR APPROACH LET'S LOOK AT A FEW CUSTOMER EXAMPLES ON THE LEFT YOU ALWAYS SEE THE VANILLA WEBSITE EXPERIENCE AND ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE
utt_0149 utt 771.57 782.32 -X SPEED KIT ENHANCED VERSION AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE FOR BOWERY WHICH IS A LARGE GERMAN ECOMMERCE RETAILER IT'S A PRETTY CLEAR WIN FOR SPEED KIT THERE IF YOU
utt_0151 utt 782.32 792.40 -X LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT SPEED KIT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT UPLIFT MOVING THE MEDIAN TIME UNTIL THE FIRST CONTENTFUL PAINT FROM ABOVE TWO SECONDS
utt_0153 utt 793.32 805.17 -X TO one point three SECONDS AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE'S THE GERMAN VERSION OF DECATHLON WHICH IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST SPORTS ONLINE RETAILER AND WE ALSO PROVIDE A
utt_0155 utt 805.17 815.09 -X SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE UPLIFT THERE HERE WE VISUALIZED THE FIRST PAINT PERFORMANCE IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND NAMELY THE WAY THAT GOOGLE USES IN THE
utt_0157 utt 815.09 827.34 -X CHROME USER EXPERIENCE REPORT AND YOU ALSO SEE THAT THE FAST EXPERIENCE SO BELOW ONE SECOND IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OFTEN ACHIEVED WITH SPEED KIT THAN WITH
utt_0159 utt 827.34 838.37 -X THE VANILLA WEBSITE AND LASTLY HERE IS ANOTHER CUSTOM OF OUR STYLE FILE AND AS YOU CAN SEE IF YOU HOLD SPEED KIT AND THE NORMAL VERSION OF THE WEBSITE SIDE
utt_0161 utt 838.37 851.04 -X BY SIDE IS ALSO CLEAR WHICH IS FASTER AND HERE WE COMPARED THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF SPEAK ABUSERS AGAINST THE NORMAL USERS WITHOUT SPEAK IT AND WE
utt_0163 utt 851.04 861.71 -X ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT UPLIFT IN BOTH THE USER BASED CONVERSION RATE AND THE AVERAGE ORDER VALUE OKAY IT'S TIME TO SUM EVERYTHING UP SPEAK IT OFF LOAD
utt_0165 utt 861.71 874.03 -X SERVICE BECAUSE IT SERVES RESOURCES FROM THE CDN THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE REQUESTED FROM THE ORIGIN SERVER THEREBY IT REDUCES LATENCY AND IMPROVES THE OVERALL
utt_0167 utt 874.03 884.13 -X CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR TALK THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION AS A CLOSING THOUGHT WE ARE PUBLISHING ONGOING
utt_0169 utt 884.13 895.22 -X RESULTS ON THE IMPACT OF WEB PERFORMANCE ON BUSINESS SUCCESS AT SPEED STUDIED INFO SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT WE DO CHECK THAT OUT YEAH OTHERWISE DROP ME
