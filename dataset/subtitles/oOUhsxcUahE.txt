utt_0000 utt 0.97 3.73 -X IN THIS TALK, I WILL PRESENT OUR RESEARCH
utt_0001 utt 4.59 9.78 -X “BSLminus oneK: SCALING UP CO-ARTICULATED SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION USING MOUTHING CUES”.
utt_0002 utt 10.44 24.02 -X MY NAME IS SAMUEL, AND THIS WORK WAS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH GÜL VAROL, LILI MOMENI, DAFFY AFOURAS, JOON SON CHUNG, NEIL FOX AND ANDREW ZISSERMAN.
utt_0004 utt 24.02 27.86 -X LET’S BEGIN WITH MOTIVATION, PRIOR WORK AND CHALLENGES.
utt_0005 utt 29.36 33.43 -X OUR GOAL IS TO AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNISE SIGNS IN SIGN LANGUAGE.
utt_0006 utt 33.90 38.64 -X THIS ABILITY HAS APPLICATIONS FOR BUILDING TOOLS AND DICTIONARIES TO SUPPORT LEARNING,
utt_0007 utt 38.89 45.87 -X PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ANALYSIS FOR SIGN LINGUISTS AND MAKING ONLINE SIGNING VIDEOS SEARCHABLE.
utt_0008 utt 46.70 51.99 -X SIGN LANGUAGE RESEARCH HAS A LONG HISTORY IN COMPUTER VISION, STRETCHING BACK OVER thirty YEARS.
utt_0009 utt 53.29 66.15 -X EARLY WORK BY TAMURA AND KAWASAKI INVESTIGATED HAND SHAPE AND TRAJECTORIES, WITH LATER EFFORTS EXPLORING MOTION WITH TIME DELAY NEURAL NETWORKS, TRANSFER LEARNING AND LEARNING BY WATCHING TV
utt_0011 utt 66.15 68.72 -X WITH MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING.
utt_0012 utt 68.72 77.68 -X MORE RECENTLY, THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN A NUMBER OF CREATIVE WORKS TACKLING THIS PROBLEM FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES – A FEW ARE LISTED HERE.
utt_0014 utt 77.74 83.64 -X IT’S WORTH STOPPING TO CONSIDER WHAT THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES ARE FOR SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION.
utt_0015 utt 83.64 94.80 -X FIRST, SIGNS ARE MULTI-CHANNEL – SIGNERS COMMUNICATE THROUGH THEIR HANDS, FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND HEAD MOVEMENTS, AS WE SEE HERE.
utt_0017 utt 94.80 98.71 -X A RECOGNITION MODEL MUST COMBINE THESE CUES SIMULTANEOUSLY.
utt_0018 utt 100.08 105.91 -X SECOND, MANY OF THE EXAMPLES WE HAVE OF PARTICULAR SIGNS ARE RECORDED IN ISOLATION.
utt_0019 utt 106.29 118.07 -X BUT TO WORK IN THE WILD, SIGNS MUST BE RECOGNISED IN CONTINUOUS SIGNING, WHERE THEY EXHIBIT CO-ARTICULATION IN WHICH THE APPEARANCE OF EACH SIGN IS INFLUENCED BY THE PREVIOUS OR NEXT SIGN.
utt_0021 utt 118.86 124.79 -X ON THE LEFT HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ISOLATED SIGNING, AND ON THE RIGHT, THE SIGNING IS CONTINUOUS -
utt_0022 utt 129.14 133.91 -X YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS ALTERS THE APPEARANCE OF THE SIGNS.
utt_0023 utt 134.51 144.50 -X NEXT, THERE CAN BE A NUMBER OF SIGNS THAT CORRESPOND TO THE SAME WORD, HERE WE SHOW BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE EXAMPLES CORRESPONDING TO THE ENGLISH WORD “BEFORE”
utt_0025 utt 144.79 147.41 -X WHICH DIFFER CONSIDERABLY IN APPEARANCE.
utt_0026 utt 152.88 159.00 -X FINALLY, AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE FOR THIS DOMAIN IS THAT THERE IS LIMITED TRAINING DATA AVAILABLE.
utt_0027 utt 159.19 167.54 -X ONE OF THE KEY DIFFICULTIES IN COLLECTING SIGN LANGUAGE DATASETS IS THAT IT REQUIRES A TREMENDOUSLY SKILLED TEAM OF ANNOTATORS WHO ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.
utt_0029 utt 168.27 175.54 -X A NUMBER OF EXCELLENT DATASETS EXIST, BUT WITH SOME LIMITATIONS: SOME CONTAIN ISOLATED SIGNING,
utt_0030 utt 175.76 181.27 -X OTHERS ARE FILMED IN LAB CONDITIONS OR HAVE LIMITED VOCABULARY.
utt_0031 utt 181.59 185.88 -X IN THIS WORK, WE TURN TO AN ABUNDANT SOURCE OF SIGNING.
utt_0032 utt 185.88 191.48 -X THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF INTERPRETED TV DATA ARE BROADCAST AROUND THE WORLD IN MANY LANGUAGES,
utt_0033 utt 191.76 193.69 -X HERE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES.
utt_0034 utt 194.55 204.06 -X WE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE AND COLLECT VIDEOS FOR WHICH WE HAVE BOTH CONTINUOUS SIGNING AND AN ACCOMPANYING SET OF SUBTITLES.
utt_0036 utt 205.88 208.28 -X USING THIS DATA COMES WITH CHALLENGES.
utt_0037 utt 208.63 217.18 -X THE FIRST IS THAT SUBTITLES ARE ONLY WEAKLY ALIGNED WITH THE SIGNING: WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE SIGNS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS START AND STOP.
utt_0039 utt 218.71 223.48 -X THE SECOND CHALLENGE IS THAT NOT ALL SUBTITLES ARE SIGNED, AND IN FACT,
utt_0040 utt 223.48 228.99 -X THERE IS A MANY TO MANY MAPPING BETWEEN SIGNS AND SUBTITLES.
utt_0041 utt 228.99 237.56 -X THIRDLY, DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN GRAMMAR STRUCTURE, ORDER MAY NOT BE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE WORDS IN THE SUBTITLES AND CORRESPONDING SIGNS.
utt_0043 utt 239.57 249.40 -X NOW I'LL DESCRIBE OUR METHODOLOGY FOR ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES, WHICH AIMS TO LABEL SIGNING DATA WITH VISUAL KEYWORD SPOTTING.
utt_0045 utt 249.40 255.39 -X THE KEY ENABLING FACTOR BEHIND OUR WORK IS THAT SIGNERS SOMETIMES MOUTH THE WORDS THEY ARE SIGNING.
utt_0046 utt 255.39 260.63 -X HERE'S IS A SHORT CLIP OF AN INTERPRETER AND A CLOSE-UP OF THEIR MOUTHING DURING SIGNING.
utt_0047 utt 265.53 274.43 -X MOUTHING ALLOWS US TO LEVERAGE SUBTITLES TO PERFORM VISUAL KEYWORD SPOTTING, IN WHICH WE SEARCH FOR THE TIMING WHEN A PARTICULAR KEYWORD IS MOUTHED.
utt_0049 utt 274.87 282.97 -X FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIND INSTANCES OF THE SIGN HAPPY, WE FIRST FIND A CLIP WHICH INCLUDES HAPPY AS A TERM IN THE SUBTITLES.
utt_0051 utt 283.29 290.40 -X THEN WE LOCALISE THE SIGN USING A VISUAL KEYWORD SPOTTER MODEL, WHOSE CONFIDENCE SHOULD PEAK WHEN THE MOUTHING APPEARS.
utt_0053 utt 297.30 304.76 -X FINALLY, WE CAN USE THE PEAK TO CROP A FIXED TEMPORAL WINDOW AROUND THE OCCURRENCE OF THE SIGN FOR HAPPY, SHOWN HERE.
utt_0055 utt 310.65 317.44 -X WE APPLIED THIS METHODOLOGY TO COLLECT BSLminus oneK, A LARGE-SCALE DATASET OF CONTINUOUS SIGN LANGUAGE.
utt_0056 utt 318.33 325.82 -X HERE WE ARE VISUALISING EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET FOUND USING HIGH CONFIDENCE MOUTHINGS FOR THE WORD HAPPY, PLAYED AT HALF SPEED.
utt_0058 utt 329.79 334.40 -X HERE ARE MORE EXAMPLES, PLAYED AT THEIR NATURAL SPEED FOR THE SIGN FAMILY,
utt_0059 utt 335.93 336.70 -X PROBLEM,
utt_0060 utt 339.23 340.16 -X CHRISTMAS,
utt_0061 utt 342.27 343.33 -X IMPORTANT
utt_0062 utt 344.99 345.95 -X BEFORE,
utt_0063 utt 347.55 348.48 -X PERFECT,
utt_0064 utt 351.26 352.35 -X MORE PERFECT
utt_0065 utt 355.03 356.93 -X AND EVEN MORE PERFECT”.
utt_0066 utt 357.69 362.21 -X USING THIS TECHNIQUE MORE THAN two hundred THOUSAND SIGNS ARE AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATED.
utt_0067 utt 363.39 368.77 -X TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE, WE INCLUDE BOTH AN AUTOMATIC TEST SET, GATHERED USING THIS TECHNIQUE,
utt_0068 utt 368.77 373.50 -X AND A MANUALLY VERIFIED SUBSET TO ENSURE HIGH-QUALITY GROUND TRUTH FOR TESTING.
utt_0069 utt 374.20 378.94 -X TO VALIDATE THE CORE HYPOTHESIS THAT MOUTHINGS CAN ACCURATELY LOCATE SIGNS,
utt_0070 utt 379.29 383.65 -X A NATIVE BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE SIGNER ASSESSED PREDICTIONS THROUGH A VERIFICATION TOOL.
utt_0071 utt 384.12 387.90 -X WE FOUND THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF HIGH CONFIDENCE MOUTHING DETECTIONS WERE CORRECT,
utt_0072 utt 388.09 392.35 -X VERIFYING ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS A LABELLING TECHNIQUE.
utt_0073 utt 392.35 396.54 -X LAST, I WILL TALK ABOUT EXPERIMENTS THAT WE PERFORMED WITH THE BSLminus oneK DATASET.
utt_0074 utt 397.69 402.94 -X WE INVESTIGATED SIGN RECOGNITION WITH A STANDARD IthreeD ACTION RECOGNITION ARCHITECTURE.
utt_0075 utt 403.26 409.22 -X TO PRIME IT FOR SIGN RECOGNITION, WE PRETRAINED IT FOR THE TASK OF VIDEO POSE DISTILLATION,
utt_0076 utt 409.22 409.95 -X SHOWN ON THE RIGHT.
utt_0077 utt 410.40 423.74 -X FOR THIS, WE APPEND AN ADDITIONAL POSE REGRESSOR TO THE IthreeD BACKBONE AND TASK IT WITH REGRESSING OPENPOSE KEYPOINTS OVER A SEQUENCE OF FRAMES TO ENCOURAGE THE MODEL TO BECOME SENSITIVE TO POSE AND RELEVANT MOTION.
utt_0080 utt 424.38 431.55 -X THE POSE REGRESSOR IS THEN DISCARDED, AND THE WEIGHTS FROM THE BACKBONE ARE RETAINED FOR SIGN RECOGNITION.
utt_0082 utt 431.55 442.47 -X WE FIND THAT THIS DISTILLATION, SHOWN ON THE RIGHT, GIVES A SMALL BOOST IN PERFORMANCE OVER RANDOM INITIALISATION OR PRETRAINING ON GESTURE RECOGNITION, SIGN RECOGNITION OR ACTION RECOGNITION.
utt_0085 utt 443.52 448.51 -X WE NEXT INVESTIGATED WHICH REGIONS OF THE SIGNER WERE IMPORTANT FOR CLASSIFICATION PERFORMANCE.
utt_0086 utt 448.51 457.95 -X THIS WAS STUDIED, BOTH FOR OUR PRIMARY IthreeD MODEL AND FOR AN ADDITIONAL SIMPLE POSE-BASED BASELINE BY MASKING REGIONS OF INPUT FOR THE MODELS.
utt_0088 utt 458.69 465.06 -X WE FOUND THAT BODY, HANDS AND FACE WERE ALL REQUIRED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO ACHIEVE GOOD RECOGNITION PERFORMANCE.
utt_0090 utt 465.69 473.41 -X BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE DATA WAS COLLECTED, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SANITY CHECK BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT THE MODEL IS NOT SIMPLY LEARNING TO RECOGNISE SIGNS FROM MOUTHINGS
utt_0092 utt 473.44 475.43 -X AND IS INSTEAD USING THE FULL INPUT.
utt_0093 utt 475.58 479.49 -X HERE ARE SOME QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF PREDICTIONS WITH OUR STRONGEST MODEL.
utt_0094 utt 480.19 488.87 -X IT SUCCESSFULLY RECOGNISES SIGNS FOR ORANGE, FANTASTIC, COMPETITION AND BEFORE.
utt_0095 utt 490.14 498.53 -X EXAMINING FAILURE CASES, WE FOUND MISTAKES FOR SIGNS WITH SIMILAR MANUAL FEATURES, LIKE SAUSAGE AND CHIPS AND WEST AND WEDNESDAY.
utt_0097 utt 499.33 513.28 -X WE ALSO FOUND MISTAKES WHERE MODEL PREDICTIONS ARE LIKELY BEST EXPLAINED BY THE SIMILAR MOUTHING PATTERNS OF THE SIGNERS, FOR EXAMPLE PREDICTING HAPPY FOR HAPPEN AND PREDICTING THREE FOR TREE.
utt_0099 utt 514.08 520.07 -X ONE USEFUL PROPERTY OF THE BSLminus oneK DATASET IS THAT ITS SCALE MAKES IT A GOOD CHOICE FOR PRETRAINING.
utt_0100 utt 520.51 529.00 -X DESPITE CONTAINING BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE, WE FOUND THAT USING IT FOR PRETRAINING BOOSTS THE DOWNSTREAM TASK PERFORMANCE OF AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE CLASSIFICATION
utt_0102 utt 529.31 532.77 -X ON THE WLASL AND MSASL BENCHMARKS.
utt_0103 utt 533.83 539.88 -X I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY MENTIONING A FEW LIMITATIONS OF OUR APPROACH: MOUTHING IS A STRONG SIGNAL,
utt_0104 utt 539.88 544.01 -X BUT IT CANNOT ANNOTATE ALL DATA BECAUSE SIGNERS DO NOT MOUTH CONTINUOUSLY.
utt_0105 utt 544.77 549.67 -X IN ADDITION, ANNOTATIONS ARE BIASED TOWARDS SIGNS WITH EASIER MOUTHINGS.
utt_0106 utt 550.21 555.59 -X IN FUTURE WORK, WE PLAN TO EXPLORE METHODS TO EXPAND ANNOTATION TO COVER NON-MOUTHED WORDS
utt_0107 utt 555.71 559.11 -X AND SCALE UP OUR EFFORTS TO FULL SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATION.
utt_0108 utt 560.23 564.97 -3.5438 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION!
