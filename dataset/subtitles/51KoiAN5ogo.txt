utt_0000 utt 1.58 7.86 -X HELLO EVERY ONE. I AM XIAO ZHOU FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF CHINA.
utt_0002 utt 7.86 9.79 -X THE TITLE OF MY PAPER IS
utt_0003 utt 9.90 17.46 -X EXTRACTING UNIT EMBEDDINGS USING SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE ACOUSTIC MODELS FOR UNIT SELECTION SPEECH SYNTHESIS.
utt_0004 utt 17.46 21.07 -X FIRST, LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE PAPER.
utt_0005 utt 22.32 35.47 -X RECENTLY, THE IDEA OF DERIVING UNIT EMBEDDING FOR UNIT SELECTION SPEECH SYNTHESIS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED VERY RECENTLY. THE UNIT EMBEDDING IS DEFINED AS A FIXED-LENGTH
utt_0007 utt 35.76 40.95 -X VECTOR FOR A PHONE-SIZED UNIT WITH VARIABLE-LENGTH IN A CORPUS.
utt_0008 utt 41.04 46.55 -X ITS PURPOSE IS TO MODEL THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE UNITS FOR CALCULATING COST FUNCTIONS.
utt_0009 utt 47.28 58.39 -X SOME METHODS EXTRACTED THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS FROM THE INTERMEDIATE LAYER IN BILSTM OR AS THE SWITCH-CONTROLLED INPUT FEATURES SHARED BETWEEN ACOUSTIC AND CONTEXT PREDICTION BRANCHES,
utt_0011 utt 58.39 69.20 -X OR USING A SIMPLE SPSS MODEL. OUR PREVIOUS WORK PROPOSED AN UNITtwoVEC MODEL TO LEARN THE PHONE-LEVEL ACOUSTIC UNIT EMBEDDINGS FROM SCRATCH.
utt_0013 utt 69.20 77.17 -X AFTER TRAINING, UNITtwoVEC LEARNS A REPRESENTATIONAL MATRIX OF R × D OF ALL UNITS IN A CORPUS,
utt_0014 utt 77.17 84.08 -X WHERE R IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF UNIT CANDIDATES IN THE CORPUS, AND D IS THE LENGTH OF THE UNIT EMBEDDING.
utt_0015 utt 85.87 90.90 -X THEN, THE REPRESENTATIONAL MATRIX WAS USED TO TRAIN COST CALCULATION FUNCTIONS.
utt_0016 utt 91.28 96.85 -X THE FT AND FC ARE OTHER TWO PHONE-LEVEL DNN MODELS WHICH MODELING COST FUNCTIONS.
utt_0017 utt 96.85 100.37 -X THE FT MODEL SIMPLY MAP THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES TO UNIT EMBEDDING.
utt_0018 utt 100.56 111.73 -X THUS CTARG FUNCTION MEASURES THE OVERALL ACOUSTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANDIDATE UNIT AND A TARGET UNIT, WHICH CAN BE USED AS A PART OF THE TARGET COST FOR UNIT SELECTION.
utt_0020 utt 111.73 117.14 -X THE FC MODEL MAP THE LINGUISTIC FEATURES AND PRECEDING UNIT EMBEDDING TO UNIT EMBEDDING.
utt_0021 utt 117.42 123.67 -X THUS CCON IS CALCULATED TO MEASURE THE LONG-TERM DEPENDENCIES AMONG CONSECUTIVE PHONE CANDIDATES.
utt_0022 utt 124.43 137.30 -X HOWEVER, THE METHOD STILL HAS TWO DEFICIENCIES. FIRST, THE EMBEDDING VECTORS ARE ONLY LEARNED FROM FRAME-LEVEL ACOUSTIC FEATURES, THE DURATION AND CONTEXT CHARACTERISTICS OF UNITS ARE IGNORED.
utt_0024 utt 137.49 144.41 -X SECOND, SEPARATE DNN MODEL IS REQUIRED TO MODEL THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS FOR TARGET COST CALCULATION.
utt_0025 utt 145.94 151.32 -X WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEURAL NETWORK-BASED STATISTICAL PARAMETRIC SPEECH SYNTHESIS
utt_0026 utt 151.38 164.28 -X END-TO-END MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, SUCH AS TACOTRON ON THE RIGHT, WHICH ADOPTS THE SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE FRAMEWORK TO COMBINE FRONT-END TEXT ANALYSIS, DURATION MODELING AND ACOUSTIC MODELING.
utt_0028 utt 165.04 170.58 -X ITS ENCODER MAPS INPUT PHONE SEQUENCE INTO FIXED-LENGTH HIDDEN REPRESENTATIONS,
utt_0029 utt 170.58 176.31 -X WHICH ARE THEN SENT INTO AN ATTENTION-BASED DECODER TO PREDICT ACOUSTIC FEATURES FRAME-BY-FRAME.
utt_0030 utt 176.31 184.82 -X THEREFORE, THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO UTILIZE THE OUTPUT VECTORS OF TACOTRON ENCODER AS UNIT EMBEDDINGS FOR UNIT SELECTION SPEECH SYNTHESIS.
utt_0032 utt 185.08 196.79 -X THIS PROPOSED METHOD HAS THREE ADVANTAGES. FIRST, THE OUTPUT VECTORS OF TACOTRON ENCODER CONTAIN NOT ONLY ACOUSTIC, BUT ALSO DURATION AND CONTEXT INFORMATION OF PHONE UNITS.
utt_0034 utt 196.79 208.70 -X SECOND, THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS ARE DERIVED IN A CONTEXT-DEPENDENT WAY, ACCORDING TO THE MAPPING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHOLE LINGUISTIC FEATURE SEQUENCES AND WHOLE ACOUSTIC FEATURE SEQUENCES.
utt_0036 utt 208.88 219.99 -X THIRD, THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS ARE DERIVED FROM LINGUISTIC FEATURES USING THE ENCODER, WHICH MEANS THAT TACOTRON IS CAPABLE TO DIRECTLY MAP THE TEXT INTO UNIT EMBEDDINGS AS FT DOING
utt_0039 utt 220.85 224.19 -X THEN, WE TALK ABOUT OUR PROPOSED METHODS.
utt_0040 utt 225.21 231.03 -X THE FLOWCHART SHOWS THE UNIT SELECTION METHOD WITH UNIT EMBEDDINGS EXTRACTED BY TACOTRON.
utt_0041 utt 231.64 237.02 -X FIRST, WE USE PAIR OF SPEECH AND LABELS TO TRAIN TACOTRON.
utt_0042 utt 237.02 244.47 -X THEN, GIVEN LABELS FOR TACOTRON, EACH CANDIDATE UNIT IN THE CORPUS IS REPRESENTED BY A UNIT EMBEDDING
utt_0043 utt 245.01 254.59 -X THEREFORE, THE REPRESENTATIONAL MATRIX WAS USED TO TRAIN GC MODEL TO MEASURE THE LONG-TERM DEPENDENCIES AMONG CONSECUTIVE PHONE CANDIDATES.
utt_0045 utt 254.71 260.60 -X FINALLY, THE TACOTRON MODEL AND GC ARE UTILIZED IN UNIT SELECTION.
utt_0046 utt 260.60 272.00 -X IN TACOTRONtwo ENCODER, THE PHONE SEQUENCES ARE REPRESENTED BY THE EMBEDDING VECTORS AND THEN ARE PASSED THROUGH A STACK OF three CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS, THEN PASSED INTO A SINGLE BILSTM.
utt_0048 utt 272.50 285.05 -X THE TWO DIRECTIONAL HIDDEN STATE VECTORS OF THE BILSTM ARE CONCATENATED TO OBTAIN THE HIDDEN VECTOR HT AT THE T-TH PHONE. INVESTIGATING THE CALCULATION FORMULA OF LSTM,
utt_0050 utt 285.24 287.71 -X THE RANGE OF HT IS minus one TO one.
utt_0051 utt 289.02 301.63 -X AFTER A TACOTRON MODEL IS ESTIMATED, EACH PHONE-SIZED CANDIDATE UNIT IN THE CORPUS IS REPRESENTED BY A FIXED-LENGTH UNIT EMBEDDING. SIMILARLY, EACH TARGET UNIT TO BE SYNTHESIZED
utt_0053 utt 301.63 309.40 -X IS ALSO CONVERTED INTO A UNIT EMBEDDING OF THE SAME DIMENSION BY ENCODING THE INPUT PHONE SEQUENCES.
utt_0054 utt 309.88 314.81 -X COMPARE WITH OUR PREVIOUS WORK, FT IS NOT NEEDED ANY MORE.
utt_0055 utt 315.48 326.27 -X IN ADDITION TO LEARN AND MODEL THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS, PHONE-LEVEL DNN MODEL GC IS ALSO NEEDED TO MEASURE THE LONG-TERM DEPENDENCIES AMONG CONSECUTIVE PHONE CANDIDATES.
utt_0057 utt 326.71 332.00 -X ITS ARCHITECTURE IS THE SAME AS FC SHOWN IN PRECEDING SLIDE.
utt_0058 utt 332.00 341.50 -X GC MODEL PREDICTS THE UNIT EMBEDDING OF CURRENT PHONE GIVEN THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS OF PRECEDING PHONES AND THE CONTEXT FEATURES OF CURRENT TARGET.
utt_0060 utt 341.50 347.45 -X THIS IS HOW TO CALCULATE THE TARGET COST AND CONCATENATION COST USING TACOTRON ENCODER OUTPUT.
utt_0061 utt 347.55 357.82 -X LET TN DENOTE THE UNIT EMBEDDING OF THE N-TH UNIT IN THE TARGET SENTENCE TO BE SYNTHESIZED, AND DN DENOTE THE UNIT EMBEDDING OF N-TH CANDIDATE UNITS.
utt_0063 utt 358.14 363.65 -X THE FUNCTION DTARG IS ADOPTED TO GET THE CANDIDATE UNITS FOR DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING SEARCH.
utt_0064 utt 363.65 376.74 -X THE FINAL TARGET COST FUNCTION FOR UNIT SELECTION INCLUDE DTARG, THE NEGATIVE LOG-LIKELIHOOD OF PHONE DURATION, AND THE KULLBACK-LEIBLER DIVERGENCES (KLDS) OF THE CONTEXT-DEPENDENT
utt_0066 utt 376.74 383.17 -X DISTRIBUTIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE MEL-CEPSTRAL COEFFICIENTS (MCCS), FzeroS AND THE PHONE DURATIONS.
utt_0067 utt 383.17 392.48 -X THE FINAL CONCATENATION COST FUNCTION IS THE WEIGHTED SUM OF DCON AND THE NEGATIVE LOG-LIKELIHOODS OF THE DIFFERENTIALS OF MCCS AND FzeroS.
utt_0069 utt 394.97 398.14 -X WE LOOK AT THE EXPERIMENTS OF OUR PAPER
utt_0070 utt 400.76 403.46 -X OUR DATASET IS ABOUT seventeen point five one HOURS MANDARIN SPEECH.
utt_0071 utt 404.83 410.66 -X IT WERE SPLIT INTO A TRAINING SET OF eleven,six hundred and eight UTTERANCES, A VALIDATION SET OF 6eleven UTTERANCES
utt_0072 utt 413.92 426.91 -X AND A TEST SET OF one hundred UTTERANCES. THE TRAINING SET WAS USED TO TRAIN TACOTRON AND GC FOR COST FUNCTION CALCULATION. THE TRAINING SET AND THE VALIDATION SET WERE MERGED TOGETHER TO PROVIDE
utt_0074 utt 426.91 433.28 -X CANDIDATE UNITS FOR UNIT SELECTION, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PHONE INSTANCES WAS four hundred and fifty-nine thousand, seven hundred and fifty.
utt_0075 utt 435.84 439.75 -X WHEN TRAINING THE TACOTRONtwo MODEL IN OUR PROPOSED METHODS.
utt_0076 utt 439.75 446.69 -X INSTEAD OF USING CHINESE CHARACTER SEQUENCES DIRECTLY, PHONEME SEQUENCES WERE ADOPTED AS INPUT.
utt_0077 utt 446.69 457.35 -X A PHONEME EMBEDDING VECTOR, A TONE EMBEDDING VECTOR AND A PROSODIC POSITION EMBEDDING VECTOR WERE CONCATENATED TO REPRESENT EACH PHONEME.
utt_0079 utt 457.35 460.45 -X THE DIMENSION OF UNIT EMBEDDING WAS two hundred and fifty-six
utt_0080 utt 462.69 468.77 -X FINALLY, THREE SYSTEMS USING OUR PURPOSED METHODS WERE BUILT AS FOLLOWS.
utt_0081 utt 468.77 472.90 -X PROP_ALL THIS SYSTEM WAS INTRODUCED IN THE PRECEDING SLIDE.
utt_0082 utt 473.57 480.26 -X PROP_TC THE UNIT PRE-SELECTION, AND THE TARGET COST CALCULATION WERE THE SAME AS PROP_ALL,
utt_0083 utt 480.26 485.38 -X AND THE CONCATENATION COST CALCULATION WAS THE SAME AS THE BASELINE SYSTEM.
utt_0084 utt 485.38 495.68 -X PROP_PS THE UNIT PRE-SELECTION WAS THE SAME AS PROP_ALL, WHILE THE TARGET COST AND CONCATENATION COST CALCULATIONS WERE THE SAME AS THE BASELINE SYSTEM.
utt_0086 utt 497.34 511.46 -X THIS FIGURE SHOWS THE PHONE-DEPENDENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS EXTRACTED FROM TACOTRON ENCODER AND UNITtwoVEC USING T-SNE. FROM THIS FIGURE, WE CAN SEE THE TACOTRON ENCODER GENERATED
utt_0088 utt 511.55 524.66 -X MORE UNIT EMBEDDING CLUSTERS FOR EACH PHONE TYPE THAN THE UNITtwoVEC MODEL. ONE POSSIBLE REASON IS THAT THE TACOTRON MODEL WAS ESTIMATED USING NOT ONLY FRAME-LEVEL ACOUSTIC FEATURES
utt_0090 utt 524.66 536.55 -X BUT ALSO LINGUISTIC FEATURES IN A SEQUENCE-TO-SEQUENCE MANNER. THUS, THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS EXTRACTED FROM THE TACOTRON ENCODER HAVE STRONGER CONTEXT-DEPENDENCY THAN THE ONES FROM UNITtwoVEC.
utt_0092 utt 536.87 548.97 -X IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNED UNIT EMBEDDINGS ON CARRYING DURATION INFORMATION, A DURATION PREDICTION EXPERIMENT WAS CONDUCTED. THREE DNN MODELS WERE CONSTRUCTED,
utt_0094 utt 548.97 553.70 -X WHICH ADOPTED THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED BY UNITtwoVEC, THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED BY
utt_0095 utt 554.31 560.33 -X TACOTRON, AND THE PHONE-LEVEL nine hundred and thirteen-DIMENSION LINGUISTIC FEATURES AS INPUT RESPECTIVELY.
utt_0096 utt 560.74 572.10 -X THE OUTPUT OF THESE MODELS WAS REPRESENTED BY A six-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR, WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF THE DURATIONS OF ONE PHONE AND ITS five HMM STATES.
utt_0098 utt 572.10 586.09 -X WE CAN SEE THAT THE PHONE DURATION RMSE OF USING THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED FROM TACOTRON WAS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE ONE USING UNITtwoVEC, WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE ACCURACY OF PREDICTING DURATIONS FROM LINGUISTIC FEATURES.
utt_0101 utt 586.09 592.71 -X IN TERMS OF PREDICTING STATE DURATIONS, THESE TWO UNIT EMBEDDINGS ACHIEVED SIMILAR ACCURACY.
utt_0102 utt 592.71 603.30 -X ONE POSSIBLE REASON IS THAT STATES ARE HIDDEN UNITS AND THE TACOTRON MODEL PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN PHONEMES THAN BETWEEN STATES.
utt_0104 utt 603.81 616.57 -X IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE LEARNED UNIT EMBEDDINGS ON CARRYING ACOUSTIC INFORMATION, WE RANDOMLY SELECTED three hundred PAIRS OF CANDIDATE UNITS FOR EACH PHONE TYPE AND
utt_0106 utt 616.57 623.24 -X CALCULATED THE ACOUSTIC DISTANCE TOGETHER WITH THE UNIT EMBEDDING DISTANCE FOR EACH PAIR.
utt_0107 utt 623.78 633.35 -X HERE, THE ACOUSTIC DISTANCE WAS CALCULATED AS THE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE BETWEEN THE AVERAGED MEL-SPECTROGRAMS OF A PAIR OF UNITS.
utt_0109 utt 633.38 647.43 -X FROM THIS FIGURE, WE CAN SEE THAT THE DISTANCES AMONG THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED FROM TACOTRON DEMONSTRATED A BETTER CORRELATION WITH ACOUSTIC DISTANCES THAN THE ONES LEARNED FROM UNITtwoVEC.
utt_0111 utt 648.42 662.09 -X IN THE SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION, WE CAN SEE THAT THE PROP_ALL SYSTEM OUTPERFORMED THE BASELINE SYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE AMONG THE TWO SYSTEMS
utt_0113 utt 662.09 675.31 -X IN OTHER THREE TESTS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MODIFYING SINGLE MODULE AMONG UNIT PRE-SELECTION AND COST CALCULATIONS USING THE UNIT EMBEDDINGS LEARNED FROM TACOTRON MAY NOT IMPROVE THE
utt_0115 utt 675.31 688.59 -X NATURALNESS OF SYNTHETIC SPEECH. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED IF THE THREE MODULES ARE MODIFIED USING THE PROPOSED UNIT EMBEDDINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY.
utt_0117 utt 688.94 695.63 -X THE DEMOS CAN FIND IN WEBSITE SHOWN IN QR CODE.
utt_0118 utt 695.66 708.24 -X SO THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO UTILIZE THE OUTPUT VECTORS OF TACOTRON ENCODER AS UNIT EMBEDDINGS FOR UNIT SELECTION SPEECH SYNTHESIS. THE LEARNED UNIT EMBEDDINGS ARE FURTHER APPLIED TO UNIT
utt_0120 utt 708.24 713.39 -X PRE-SELECTION, TARGET COST CALCULATION AND CONCATENATION COST CALCULATION.
utt_0121 utt 713.64 721.17 -X SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROPOSED METHODS AND SHOW THAT THE
utt_0122 utt 721.17 728.91 -3.6255 UNIT EMBEDDINGS EXTRACTED FROM TACOTRON CONTAIN ACOUSTIC, DURATION AND CONTEXT INFORMATION OF PHONE UNITS.
