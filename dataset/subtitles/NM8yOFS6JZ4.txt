utt_0000 utt 0.03 2.03 -X THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THIS VIDEO PRESENTATION.
utt_0001 utt 2.16 5.58 -X MY NAME IS DANIEL LANGE AND I AM PLEASED TO INTRODUCE HIVEFIVE TO YOU.
utt_0002 utt 5.58 15.60 -X AN IMMERSION-PRESERVING ATTENTION-GUIDANCE TECHNIQUE IN VIRTUAL REALITY, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED BY MY CO-AUTHORS TIM CLAUDIUS STRATMANN, UWE GRUENEFELD, PROF. SUSANNE BOLL AND ME.
utt_0004 utt 15.60 18.29 -X VR ALLOWS US TO HAVE IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES.
utt_0005 utt 18.29 32.11 -X IT IS DESCRIBED BY PIMENTEL AND TEIXEIRA AS “AN INTERACTIVE, IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCE GENERATED BY A COMPUTER, IN WHICH IMMERSION IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE USED TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A LIVING ILLUSION OF REALITY FOR THE HUMAN SENSES.“
utt_0008 utt 32.59 41.07 -X WITH RECENT ADVANCES, SUCH AS IMPROVED TRACKING, HIGHER SCREEN RESOLUTIONS AND WIDER FIELDS OF VIEW, VR TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMMERSIVE.
utt_0010 utt 41.07 48.37 -X DUE TO THE FREEDOMS THAT THE USER HAS IN A VR WORLD, THE PROBLEM THAT THE USER MIGHT MISS RELEVANT CONTENT THAT IS PRESENTED TO HIM INCREASES.
utt_0012 utt 48.37 55.19 -X TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM MANY CREATIVE AND INTERESTING TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, WHICH CAN BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO THREE CATEGORIES.
utt_0014 utt 55.19 58.00 -X TECHNIQUES THAT ROTATE THE USER OR THE VIRTUAL WORLD
utt_0015 utt 58.19 67.03 -X TECHNIQUES THAT MANIPULATE THE ENVIRONMENT BY SALIENCY CHANGES OR BLURRING OF CERTAIN AREAS AND TECHNIQUES THAT AUGMENT RELEVANT CONTENT BY ARTIFICIAL EFFECTS.
utt_0018 utt 67.03 77.17 -X HOWEVER, ALL THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON, THEY AFFECT THE USER'S EXPERIENCE BY MODIFYING PROPERTIES OF THE PRESENTED WORLD, WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE PERCEIVED IMMERSION.
utt_0021 utt 77.17 85.97 -X IN THE FIELD OF CINEMATIC VIRTUAL REALITY, A FOURTH CATEGORY OF ATTENTION GUIDANCE WAS INVESTIGATED, WHICH IS COMMON IN FILM AND THEATRE: DIEGETIC CUES.
utt_0023 utt 86.13 90.00 -X THESE ARE VISUAL OR ACOUSTIC CUES THAT ARE PART OF THE PRESENTED WORLD.
utt_0024 utt 90.32 101.59 -X NIELSEN ET AL. INVESTIGATED IF A FIREFLY CAN BE USED AS A DIEGETIC STIMULUS TO MAKE AN PLOT MORE COMPREHENSIBLE AND ROTHE ET AL. INVESTIGATED MOVING OBJECTS IN A CVR ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0026 utt 101.59 105.91 -X THEY FOUND THAT MOVING OBJECTS CAN ATTRACT ATTENTION EVEN WITHOUT SOUNDS.
utt_0027 utt 105.91 112.28 -X HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GENERIC DIEGETIC VISUAL CUE THAT IS APPLICABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF SETTINGS AND ENVIRONMENTS.
utt_0029 utt 112.28 119.35 -X THIS INSPIRED US TO CREATE A CUE THAT DIRECTS ATTENTION AND CAN BE PERCEIVED AS PART OF THE WORLD HOWEVER, THIS CREATES A PROBLEM.
utt_0031 utt 119.35 123.73 -X SINCE THE CUE IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE RESPECTIVE ENVIRONMENT,
utt_0032 utt 123.73 127.35 -X IT MUST HAVE GENERIC PROPERTIES THAT ALLOW THE CUE TO BE ADAPTED.
utt_0033 utt 127.35 134.13 -X SO IT HAD TO BE A CUE THAT WORKS IN DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, THAT IS DIEGETIC AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE IMMERSION IN A NEGATIVE WAY.
utt_0035 utt 134.35 138.45 -X THIS GAVE US THE IDEA TO USE A VISUALIZATION BASED ON SWARM MOTION.
utt_0036 utt 138.45 143.70 -X AS YOU MIGHT KNOW, A SWARM IS A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THAT MOVES AS A COLLECTIVE.
utt_0037 utt 143.70 151.77 -X IN NATURE, DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF SUCH SWARMS EXIST (LIKE FLOCKS OF BIRDS, SCHOOLS OF FISH OR INSECT SWARMS).
utt_0039 utt 151.77 165.00 -X THE ADVANTAGE OF SWARMS AS VISUALIZATION IS THAT SWARMS EXIST IN NATURE AND THEY CREATE A CONSTANT FIELD OF MOTION, WHICH IS A STRONG CUE IN PERIPHERAL VISION BUT WHEN WE SPEAK ABOUT MOTION, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN HUMAN
utt_0042 utt 165.00 167.51 -X PERCEPTION OF BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION.
utt_0043 utt 167.51 172.02 -X BIOLOGICAL MOTION REFERS TO MOTION PATTERNS EMANATING FROM LIVING ORGANISMS.
utt_0044 utt 172.02 185.24 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF POINTS OF LIGHT ARE GLUED TO THE MAIN JOINTS OF A PERSON AND THE PERSON MOVES WHEN THE LIGHT IS SWITCHED OFF, WE ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A PERSON IN IT, WHICH IS VISIBLE ON THIS SLIDE THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT BIOLOGICAL MOTION
utt_0047 utt 185.24 193.59 -X IS EASIER TO DETECT THAN UNSTRUCTURED NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION AND THAT BIOLOGICAL MOTION IS PERCEIVED INCREDIBLE FAST, COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF MOTION.
utt_0049 utt 193.59 202.46 -X FOR THIS REASON, WE WANTED TO FIND OUT NOT ONLY IF A SWARM-BASED VISUALIZATION IS SUITABLE FOR GUIDING ATTENTION, BUT ALSO IF BIOLOGICAL MOTION CAN BE PERCEIVED MORE QUICKLY IN VR
utt_0051 utt 202.71 204.51 -X THAN NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION.
utt_0052 utt 204.51 206.39 -X BUT HOW DO YOU IMPLEMENT SUCH A SWARM?
utt_0053 utt 206.39 209.37 -X AND DOES THE TYPE OF MOTION INFLUENCE THE PERCEPTION?
utt_0054 utt 209.43 218.11 -X TO ANSWER THIS QUESTIONS, WE FIRST DESIGNED THE BASIC SYSTEM AND DEFINED ALL THE BASIC PARAMETERS, THAT SHOULD APPLY TO THE SWARM AND BOTH MOTION TYPES
utt_0056 utt 218.20 227.42 -X LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE PARAMETERS FIRST OF ALL, WE DECIDED TO TAKE A LOT OF INSPIRATION FROM BEES, AS BEES APPEAR IN SWARMS AND WOULD FIT WELL WITHIN ANY OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0059 utt 227.45 234.04 -X BUT HOW DO WE GET THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRAJECTORIES OF FLYING BEES TO TRANSFER THEM INTO A VR ENVIRONMENT?
utt_0061 utt 234.23 238.46 -X WE HAVE RESEARCHED THE LITERATURE TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS ALREADY MADE THE EFFORT.
utt_0062 utt 238.61 241.31 -X UNFORTUNATELY, WE COULDN'T FIND ANY DATA ON BEES.
utt_0063 utt 241.43 242.43 -X BUT ON MIDGES!
utt_0064 utt 242.90 251.68 -X SINHUBER ET AL. TRACKED MIDGES UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS IN A GLASS BOX AND RECORDED THEIR POSITIONS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPACE WITH A RESOLUTION OF tenMS.
utt_0066 utt 252.63 256.48 -X WE USED THIS DATASET TO REPRODUCE BIOLOGICAL MOTION IN OUR SYSTEM.
utt_0067 utt 257.18 262.49 -X TO CREATE THE NON-BIOLOGICAL SWARM, WE DECIDED TO USE THE FLOCKING ALGORITHM BY REYNOLDS.
utt_0068 utt 262.49 265.98 -X WHICH, DESPITE ITS SIMPLICITY, PRODUCES VERY GOOD RESULTS.
utt_0069 utt 266.36 275.39 -X THEN WE DEFINED THE BASIC PARAMETERS BOTH SWARM-VARIANTS HAVE TO SHARE WE DECIDED TO USE THE COLOR YELLOW, SINCE SOME BEE SPECIES ARE YELLOW, AND IT IS ALSO
utt_0071 utt 275.39 281.40 -X THE BEST PERCEIVED COLOR IN PERIPHERAL VISION OUR BEES CONSIST OF A SPHERE-SHAPE WITH A
utt_0072 utt 282.36 286.80 -X DIAMETER OF fiveMM BECAUSE THE AVERAGE WORKER BEE IS ABOUT fiveminus sevenMM IN SIZE
utt_0073 utt 287.83 294.72 -X IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BEES AND SPREAD FOR THE ENTIRE SWARM, WE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY WITH THREE PEOPLE.
utt_0075 utt 295.29 298.75 -X WE CHOSE ten BEES TO AVOID CLUTTERING THE BACKGROUND TOO MUCH.
utt_0076 utt 299.03 305.05 -X DERIVED FROM THE SPEED AT WHICH THE RECORDED MIDGES MOVED, WE FOUND A VELOCITY OF zero point three fiveM/SECOND
utt_0077 utt 307.64 316.48 -X WITH A SPREAD OF five° VISUAL ANGLE IN EACH DIRECTION WORKS BEST SINCE OUR TECHNIQUE IS INSPIRED BY BEES, WHICH ARE LIVING IN A BEEHIVE, AND HAS A SPREAD
utt_0079 utt 317.15 319.93 -X OF five° IN EACH DIRECTION, WE CALL IT HIVEFIVE.
utt_0080 utt 319.93 326.75 -X TO AVOID FURTHER GRAPHICAL INFLUENCES, WE USED A UNICOLOR SHADER WITHOUT REFLECTIONS AND SWITCHED OFF SHADOWS FOR THE BEES.
utt_0082 utt 327.10 332.03 -X WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF SWARMS, THE TWO KINDS OF MOTION ARE VISUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE.
utt_0083 utt 332.03 335.12 -X WE IMPLEMENTED THE SWARM IN UNITY AND THEY ARE LOOKING LIKE THIS
utt_0084 utt 340.32 351.90 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, THE BIOLOGICAL SWARM IS RATHER CHAOTIC AND THE INDIVIDUAL MIDGES ARE MOVING WITHOUT AN OBVIOUS PATTERN WHILE THE NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION IS A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER AND MORE UNIFORM.
utt_0087 utt 352.09 355.62 -X BUT WHICH OF THESE TWO TYPES OF MOTION IS PERCEIVED FASTER IN VR?
utt_0088 utt 355.93 359.17 -X THAT IS WHAT WE WANTED TO FIND OUT WITH THE FIRST STUDY.
utt_0089 utt 359.20 371.33 -X FOR THIS STUDY, WE ASKED: WHAT EFFECT DO BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL SWARM MOTIONS HAVE ON THE RESPONSE TIMES FOR ATTENTION GUIDANCE AND IN HOW FAR DOES MOTION IN THE SCENE INFLUENCE THESE TIMES?
utt_0092 utt 371.33 375.17 -X IN Hone WE ASSUMED THAT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTION SWARM IS PERCEIVED FASTER.
utt_0093 utt 375.64 380.67 -X IN Htwo WE ASSUMED, THAT ADDITIONAL MOTION IN THE SCENE MASKS THE MOTION OF THE NON-BIOLOGICAL SWARM.
utt_0095 utt 380.67 384.19 -X NOW LETS TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDY DESIGN FOR THE FIRST STUDY
utt_0096 utt 384.99 388.93 -X WE CONDUCTED A WITHIN-SUBJECTS CONTROLLED LABORATORY STUDY IN VR.
utt_0097 utt 389.34 401.70 -X WE IMPLEMENTED HIVEFIVE IN UNITY UND USED THE HTC VIVE WITH AN EYETRACKER TO MEASURE THE USER PERFORMANCE AS THE TIME TO FIRST FIXATION, WHICH IS THE TIME BETWEEN THE SWARM APPEARS AND THE FIRST EYE FIXATION.
utt_0100 utt 402.40 413.44 -X TO ADD MOTION TO THE SCENE WE HAVE USED TWO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, CREATED FROM UNITY ASSETS: AN ARTIFICIAL CITY ENVIRONMENT WITH MOTION AND A NATURAL FOREST ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0102 utt 413.44 420.77 -X IN ORDER TO CREATE EYE MOVEMENT, WE LET THE USER LOOK AT A SPHERE THAT MOVES IN THE FIELD OF VISION ON THE PATH OF A LEMNISCATE.
utt_0104 utt 422.27 431.65 -X AFTER A RANDOM TIME INTERVAL OF twenty-five+minus five SECONDS, THE SWARM APPEARED AND PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO LOOK AT THE SWARM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TO PRESS A BUTTON
utt_0106 utt 431.90 434.12 -X THE ENVIRONMENTS LOOKED LIKE THIS.
utt_0107 utt 434.12 440.90 -X IN THE CITY ENVIRONMENT, THE PARTICIPANT STOOD AT A BUSY ROAD, SO THAT PERMANENT MOTION WAS CREATED BY PASSING CARS IN THE FIELD OF VISION.
utt_0109 utt 441.15 444.90 -X THE FOREST ENVIRONMENT WAS COMPLETELY WITHOUT MOTION INSIDE OF THE SCENE.
utt_0110 utt 445.12 450.02 -X TO CARRY OUT THE STUDY WE RECRUITED twenty VOLUNTEER PARTICIPANTS AGED BETWEEN twenty-three AND sixty YEARS
utt_0111 utt 452.19 454.56 -X WITH CORRECTED OR CORRECTED TO NORMAL VISION.
utt_0112 utt 455.17 457.76 -X NO PARTICIPANT HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH VR.
utt_0113 utt 458.24 463.36 -X WE HAVE MEASURED THE INFLUENCE OF MOTION THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE USER WITH THE VRSQ
utt_0114 utt 464.96 474.44 -X AND WERE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT THERE IS AN EFFECT BECAUSE THE VRSQ IS LOWER IN THE FOREST SETTING.
utt_0116 utt 474.44 484.26 -X AS THE RESULTS SHOW, IN THE CITY SETTING, THE SWARM WITH NONBIOLOGICAL MOTION LED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TTFF THAN THE SWARM WITH BIOLOGICAL MOTION.
utt_0118 utt 484.71 489.41 -X IN THE FOREST SETTING, WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTAL MOTION, THE EFFECT WAS EVEN STRONGER.
utt_0119 utt 490.27 495.06 -X IN TOTAL, THE SWARM WITH NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION LED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TTFF THAN THE
utt_0120 utt 495.84 499.88 -X SWARM WITH BIOLOGICAL SWARM MOTION AVERAGED OVER BOTH SETTINGS.
utt_0121 utt 500.67 507.21 -X THE RESPONSE TIMES FOR SWARMS WITH BIOLOGICAL MOTION WERE SLOWER THAN FOR SWARMS WITH NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION.
utt_0123 utt 507.21 508.87 -X THEREFORE, WE CANNOT ACCEPT Hone.
utt_0124 utt 510.27 519.49 -X FURTHERMORE, IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE ADDITIONAL MOTION IN THE CITY ENVIRONMENT CAUSED WORSE REACTION TIMES, BUT ONLY FOR THE NON-BIOLOGICAL SWARM.
utt_0126 utt 519.65 525.42 -X THIS COULD MEAN THAT BIOLOGICAL MOTION CANNOT BE MASKED BY OTHER MOTION AS EASILY AS NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION.
utt_0128 utt 525.51 527.66 -X SO WE CAN ACCEPT OUR HYPOTHESIS Htwo.
utt_0129 utt 528.74 533.58 -X IN A FURTHER STUDY WE WANTED TO FIND OUT WHETHER HIVEFIVE COMPETE AGAINST KNOWN TECHNIQUES.
utt_0130 utt 534.12 542.28 -X SO FOR THE SECOND STUDY, WE ASKED: (RQtwo) WHICH TECHNIQUE GUIDES USERS ATTENTION THE FASTEST WHILE PRESERVING THE PERCEIVED IMMERSION IN VIRTUAL REALITY?
utt_0132 utt 543.24 548.07 -X IN Hthree WE ASSUMED THAT HIVEFIVE PERFORMS BEST WITH REGARDS TO RESPONSE TIME.
utt_0133 utt 548.96 552.81 -X IN Hfour WE EXPECT HIVEFIVE TO HAVE THE LEAST NEGATIVE IMPACT ON IMMERSION.
utt_0134 utt 553.25 559.78 -X IN OUR STUDY, AGAIN, WE CONDUCTED A WITHIN-SUBJECTS CONTROLLED LABORATORY STUDY IN VR USING THE HTC VIVE AND AN EYETRACKER.
utt_0136 utt 559.94 565.42 -X WE COMPARED HIVEFIVE TO IMPLEMENTATIONS OF ARROW, BLURRING, DEADEYE, AND SUBTLE GAZE DIRECTION.
utt_0138 utt 565.54 572.43 -X THE STUDY WAS SLIGHTLY MODIFIED AND NOW CONSISTED OF A SEARCH TASK THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE VIRTUAL FOREST SETTING FROM THE FIRST STUDY.
utt_0140 utt 573.48 582.79 -X AN APPLE TREE WAS FILLED WITH APPLES AND ONE RANDOM TARGET APPLE WHICH COULD ONLY BE FOUND WITH THE HELP OF THE TECHNIQUES BECAUSE IT HAD NO UNIQUE VISIBLE FEATURES.
utt_0142 utt 583.21 585.58 -X OTHERWISE, THE STUDY CONDITIONS WERE SIMILAR.
utt_0143 utt 585.73 592.14 -X AFTER THE TECHNIQUE WAS DETECTED, THE PARTICIPANTS PRESSED A BUTTON AND THE TARGET APPLE COULD BE SELECTED WITH A STEAMVR LASER.
utt_0145 utt 592.81 603.05 -X WE HAVE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEASURED THE TTFF WITH UNITY AND THE PERCEIVED PRESENCE WITH THE IGROUP PRESENCE QUESTIONNAIRE TO GET A FEELING FOR THE EXPERIENCED IMMERSION.
utt_0147 utt 603.05 605.32 -X NOW LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTED TECHNIQUES.
utt_0148 utt 605.32 611.56 -X WE IMPLEMENTED ARROW AS A THREE DIMENSIONAL ARROW WITH A LENGTH OF five° VISUAL ANGLE AND A YELLOW COLOR.
utt_0150 utt 611.56 618.41 -X THE TIP OF THE ARROW IS LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE APPLE AND CIRCLES AROUND IT, WHILE THE BACK OF THE ARROW POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PARTICIPANT’S GAZE.
utt_0152 utt 619.18 624.08 -X BLURRING WAS IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED BY HATA ET AL. AND WAS USED IN ITS STRONGEST FORM,
utt_0153 utt 624.08 627.63 -X SINCE THE BACKGROUND IS ALSO PERMANENTLY BLURRED BY THE EYE MOVEMENTS.
utt_0154 utt 627.63 634.12 -X THE TARGET WAS UNBLURRED AND PLACED CENTRALLY IN AN AREA WITH A DIAMETER OF five° VISUAL ANGLE.
utt_0155 utt 634.12 641.32 -X SUBTLE GAZE DIRECTION WAS VISUALLY IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED BY BAILEY ET AL., BY PLACING A TWO-DIMENSIONAL ROUND SHAPE DIRECTLY ON THE TARGET.
utt_0158 utt 647.72 652.91 -X DEADEYE WAS IMPLEMENTED AS DESCRIBED BY KREKHOV ET AL. BY RENDERING A TARGET ON ONE EYE ONLY.
utt_0159 utt 653.38 658.89 -X HIVEFIVE WAS USED BY HAVING THE SWARM APPEAR CLOSE TO THE TARGET APPLE AND THEREFORE MARKING IT.
utt_0161 utt 658.89 661.23 -X FIRST WE WILL HAVE A LOOK AT THE RESULTS REGARDING Hthree.
utt_0162 utt 661.55 663.73 -X WHICH TECHNIQUE WAS PERCEIVED FASTER?
utt_0163 utt 663.73 667.37 -X ONLY THE PERCEIVED STIMULI PER TECHNIQUE WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
utt_0164 utt 667.37 667.92 -X SO..
utt_0165 utt 667.92 678.89 -X WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT RESULTS REGARDING TTFF, WITH ARROW AND HIVEFIVE BEING PERCEIVED THE FASTEST WITH TIMES UNDER ONE SECOND IN THE MEDIAN, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY SGD AND BLURRING,
utt_0167 utt 678.89 680.88 -X WHILE DEADEYE BEING PERCEIVED THE SLOWEST.
utt_0168 utt 681.19 689.65 -X WE SUSPECT THAT THE PARTICIPANTS’ CONCENTRATION ON THE SPHERE, COMBINED WITH THE PERMANENT EYE MOVEMENT AND MOTION WITHIN THE SCENE, HAVE MADE PERCEPTION MORE DIFFICULT.
utt_0170 utt 690.41 697.93 -X ALTHOUGH HIVEFIVE WAS VERY FAST, ARROW WAS PERCEIVED MINIMALLY FASTER, WHICH IS WHY WE CANNOT ACCEPT HYPOTHESIS Hthree.
utt_0172 utt 699.56 701.81 -X LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT THE RESULTS REGARDING Hfour.
utt_0173 utt 701.81 705.14 -X WHICH TECHNIQUE HAD A LESS STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE IMMERSION.
utt_0174 utt 705.39 714.32 -X THE RESULTS OF THE IPQ SHOWS THAT THE PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST SENSE OF PRESENCE AND THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF REALISM WITH HIVEFIVE.
utt_0176 utt 714.70 724.27 -X A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS SHARED THE OPINION THAT HIVEFIVE FITS BEST INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT HIVEFIVE WAS PERCEIVED AS A DIEGETIC STIMULUS
utt_0178 utt 724.94 732.46 -X THE RESULTS OF THE SUBJECTIVE MEASURES SHOWS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE FELT DISTRACTED BY HIVE FIVE… WHILE DEADEYE AND BLURRING DISTRACTED THEM THE MOST.
utt_0180 utt 732.84 739.15 -X THIS MEANS HIVEFIVE ALLOWS US TO GUIDE ATTENTION WHILE MAINTAINING THE SENSE OF PRESENCE AND THUS IMMERSION.
utt_0182 utt 739.34 744.59 -X IN CONTRAST TO THE OTHER TECHNIQUES, WHICH GENERATING ATTENTION THROUGH ARTIFICIAL CUES,
utt_0183 utt 744.84 749.46 -X HIVEFIVE FITS WELL INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THEREFORE, WE CAN ACCEPT OUR HYPOTHESIS Hfour.
utt_0184 utt 752.40 754.87 -X LET'S DISCUSS THE RESULTS A LITTLE FURTHER.
utt_0185 utt 755.60 761.11 -X HIVEFIVE IS A TECHNIQUE THAT MUST BE CAREFULLY ADAPTED TO THE SCENARIO AND THE ENVIRONMENT TO PRESERVE IMMERSION.
utt_0187 utt 761.11 770.64 -X BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT SWARM VISUALIZATION AND AN ABSTRACTION OF SWARMS TO PARTICLES WILL OPEN MANY FIELDS OF APPLICATION WHILE WE HAVE TRIED TO FIND THE MOST REALISTIC
utt_0189 utt 770.64 780.66 -X PARAMETERS FOR HIVEFIVE, WE THINK THAT HIVEFIVE’S NOTICEABILITY CAN PROBABLY BE IMPROVED BY ADJUSTING SOME PARAMETERS LIKE COLOR, SPEED, AND SPREAD OF THE PARTICLES.
utt_0191 utt 781.20 793.14 -X ONE CAN ALSO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PARTICLES AND USE ANIMATED MODELS, SUCH AS threeD MODELS OF BEES TO MAYBE INCREASE IMMERSION AND SALIENCY BUT HOW TRANSFERABLE ARE THE RESULTS TO OTHER APPLICATIONS?
utt_0194 utt 793.14 802.32 -X WITH CINEMATIC VR OR GAMING AS THE MAIN APPLICATION FIELDS OF OUR TECHNIQUE, THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE OF HAVING MOTION IN THE SCENE AND OUR FIRST STUDY SHOWED TWO INTERESTING THINGS.
utt_0196 utt 802.35 807.89 -X FIRST, WE SAW THAT ADDITIONAL MOTION INFLUENCES THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NON-BIOLOGICAL SWARM.
utt_0197 utt 807.98 818.84 -X SECOND, IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE BIOLOGICAL MOTION IS LESS AFFECTED BY THIS AND THAT EVEN WITH MORE MOTION IN THE BACKGROUND THE PERCEPTION OF THE BIOLOGICAL SWARM STAYS MORE OR LESS THE SAME.
utt_0200 utt 818.90 824.50 -X THIS COULD MEAN, THAT THE BIOLOGICAL MOTION COULD BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE FOR SCENES WITH A LOT OF MOTION.
utt_0202 utt 824.94 827.54 -X BUT OF COURSE, OUR TECHNIQUE HAS LIMITATIONS AS WELL
utt_0203 utt 827.63 840.73 -X AS I SAID, HIVEFIVE IS USING A VISUAL DIEGETIC STIMULUS, AND MUST BE CAREFULLY ADAPTED TO THE CONTEXT OF THE USED ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER, THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH THE METHOD MAKES NO SENSE.
utt_0206 utt 840.73 851.29 -X FOR EXAMPLE, FLIES IN AN OFFICE ENVIRONMENT MAY MAKE SENSE, BUT IT IS NOT COMMON FOR THEM TO BE IN SWARMS AND USERS MIGHT FEEL IRRITATED BY A SWARM VISUALIZATION IN THIS CONTEXT.
utt_0208 utt 851.29 860.53 -X ALSO WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE SWARM MOTION COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SOME PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE PHOBIAS ABOUT ANIMALS THAT MOVE IN SWARMS, LIKE SOME INSECTS OKAY, LET'S RECAP.
utt_0211 utt 860.59 868.25 -X WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT HIVEFIVE RESULTS IN FASTEST RESPONSE TIMES, TOGETHER WITH ARROW AND HAS THE SMALLEST NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PERCEIVED IMMERSION.
utt_0213 utt 868.25 882.07 -X OUR RESULTS SUGGESTS THAT HUMANS, IMMERSED INTO VR, CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION INTERESTING IS THAT THE QUALITY OF PERCEPTIONS OF NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION SEEMS TO DETERIORATE WHEN ADDITIONAL NON-BIOLOGICAL MOTION TAKES
utt_0216 utt 882.07 889.05 -X PLACE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WE THINK FURTHER WORK COULD ADAPT HIVEFIVE TO MAKE USERS AWARE OF TARGETS OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD OF VIEW
utt_0218 utt 889.27 894.65 -X OR CREATE ALTERNATIVE APPLICATIONS, LIKE MULTI-COLORED VARIANTS AND DIFFERENT MOTION-PATTERNS.
utt_0219 utt 895.03 896.73 -X WE HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE TALK.
utt_0220 utt 896.73 898.14 -X THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION!
utt_0221 utt 898.14 898.90 -2.6494 STAY HEALTHY.
