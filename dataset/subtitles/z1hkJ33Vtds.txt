utt_0000 utt 0.14 4.88 -X SO LET'S GET STARTED! I'M SABRINA MIELKE, I'M ONE OF THE FOUR AUTHORS ON THIS PAPER,
utt_0001 utt 4.91 10.16 -X WHICH IS DONE WITH COLLEAGUES AT FACEBOOK AI RESEARCH, WHERE THIS WAS MY INTERNSHIP PROJECT.
utt_0002 utt 10.16 24.08 -X IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNEST THINGS I'VE EVER DONE SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT IT! THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS REDUCING CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS' OVERCONFIDENCE THROUGH LINGUISTIC CALIBRATION AND THAT'S KIND OF A MOUTHFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING APART AS WE GO THROUGH THESE SLIDES.
utt_0005 utt 24.08 28.46 -X IF YOU WANT TO READ THE PAPER IT IS A TACL PAPER BUT SINCE TACL IS A LITTLE BACKLOGGED,
utt_0006 utt 28.46 33.04 -X IT'S ON AN ARXIV AND THAT'S THE TACL MASTER SO YOU CAN CHECK THAT OUT WHENEVER YOU WANT.
utt_0007 utt 33.61 42.31 -X SO, LET'S SEE WHAT IS THIS BOOK REALLY ABOUT? WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO A CHATBOT THESE DAYS CHANCES ARE IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE POWERED BY A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL
utt_0009 utt 42.73 46.26 -X SO, A STATE-OF-THE-ART MODEL AT THE TIME WE DID THIS WAS BLENDERBOT,
utt_0010 utt 46.61 56.59 -X WHICH IS A CHATBOT TRAINED TO BE ENGAGING, CONVERSATIONAL... THREE BILLION PARAMETERS WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE SMALL NOWADAYS I GUESS, BUT IT WAS A GREAT THING AT THE TIME,
utt_0012 utt 56.59 60.40 -X I GUESS. AND I'M GOING TO REPRESENT THIS IN THESE SLIDES WITH THIS CUTE LITTLE ROBOT FACE!
utt_0013 utt 60.78 69.78 -X I TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK CUTE. IT DIDN'T LOOK CUTE. I GAVE UP, I MADE IT LOOK WEIRD INSTEAD UM... SO THAT'S WHAT YOU GET. SO YOU CAN ASK THIS ROBOT A QUESTION LIKE HOW DO YOU LIKE SEATTLE?
utt_0015 utt 69.78 73.84 -X AND THEN IT'S GOING TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF THINKING AND COME UP WITH THE ANSWER: I LOVE IT!
utt_0016 utt 73.84 88.18 -X MAYBE SAY A LITTLE BIT MORE IT'S GONNA BE LIKE YEAH IT'S MY SECOND FAVORITE PLACE IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST (SORRY TO ALL THE SEATTLE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE). BUT WE CAN ALSO ASK A MORE FACT-BASED QUESTIONS LIKE TRIVIAQA QUESTIONS (IF YOU KNOW THAT DATA SET). CLASSIC QA DATA SET
utt_0019 utt 88.18 102.71 -X AND IF WE USE IT IN A CLOSED-BOOK MANNER, THAT IS, WITHOUT GIVING OUR MODEL ANY OF THE SUPPORTING EVIDENCE THAT USUALLY COMES WITH THESE QA DATA SETS, AND JUST STRAIGHT ASK THE QUESTION WHERE WAS BARACK OBAMA BORN?---JUST SEE IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER IN YOUR WEIGHTS WITHOUT
utt_0022 utt 102.86 107.54 -X HAVING ACCESS TO WIKIPEDIA OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN THIS CASE BLENDERBOT ANSWERS:
utt_0023 utt 107.54 113.11 -X HE WAS BORN IN HAWAII, WHICH: AWESOME. THAT IS CONFIDENT AND CORRECT, THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.
utt_0026 utt 123.54 128.18 -X WAS THE sixteenTH PRESIDENT?---JUST QUICK SHOW OF HANDS, WHO KNOWS WHO THE sixteenTH U.S PRESIDENT
utt_0028 utt 132.94 147.51 -X AND NEITHER DOES BLENDERBOT IT SAYS OH I'M NOT SURE BUT HERE, THE US WAS FOUNDED one thousand, seven hundred and seventy-six, WHICH YOU KNOW HONESTLY THAT'S PRETTY ALL RIGHT IT'S INCORRECT LIKE THERE'S NO CORRECT ANSWER IN THERE BUT IT WAS ALSO NOT GIVEN WITH A LOT OF CONFIDENCE SO THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO
utt_0031 utt 147.51 159.43 -X SEE. WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I ASK WHO IS THE forty-fourTH U.S PRESIDENT---WHICH SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOU PROBABLY KNOW IT WAS NOT GEORGE H.W BUSH
utt_0033 utt 159.66 166.18 -X AND CERTAINLY HE DID NOT SERVE UNTIL two thousand and nine. SO THIS IS A TERRIBLE CASE WHERE WE ARE INCORRECT
utt_0034 utt 166.29 176.69 -X BUT STILL CONFIDENT. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE BOT BEING *OVERCONFIDENT*! AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WANT TO GET AT IN THIS TALK. OVERCONFIDENCE REALLY IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M GOING TO
utt_0036 utt 176.69 183.67 -X CALL MISCALIBRATION AND WHEN I SAY MISCALIBRATION REALLY WHAT DO I MEAN BY CALIBRATION? CALIBRATION,
utt_0037 utt 183.67 195.45 -X I'M GOING TO DEFINE HERE AS MAKING SURE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY THAT IS ASCRIBED TO SOME PREDICTION CORRESPONDS TO THE CHANCE OF THAT PREDICTION BEING CORRECT AND SO WE CAN PLOT THIS ON A GRAPH LIKE
utt_0039 utt 195.63 201.24 -X THAT WHERE ON THE X-AXIS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CERTAINTY OF A GIVEN QUESTION IN THIS CASE,
utt_0042 utt 209.96 223.77 -X OR INCORRECT! YEAH, WELL, WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOT PLOTTING INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS IN THESE PLOTS BUT WE ARE *BUCKETING* THE DATA POINTS. IN THIS EXAMPLE, SAY WE'RE CHOOSING FOUR BUCKETS OF CERTAINTY, FOUR BUCKETS IN WHICH WE'RE GROUPING EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR CERTAINTY. SO ON
utt_0045 utt 223.77 228.79 -X THE LEFT WE HAVE THE ONES WHERE THE PREDICTOR WAS LIKE... VERY UNCERTAIN ON THE RIGHT VERY CERTAIN.
utt_0046 utt 229.07 237.78 -X WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THE CORRECTNESS FOR EACH OF THESE BUCKETS (WHICH NOW MAKES SENSE AS A PERCENTAGE---LIKE HOW MANY OUT OF ALL THE ONES IN THE BUCKET DID YOU GET CORRECT)
utt_0048 utt 237.78 245.21 -X LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CALLING LIKE A WEATHER CASTER LINE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE THE ONE HUMAN PROFESSION THAT ACTUALLY GETS THESE THINGS PRETTY RIGHT.
utt_0051 utt 249.98 259.99 -X RIGHT IF YOUR CERTAINTY IS HIGH: YEAH YOU BETTER GET IT RIGHT. AND THE TWO FAILURE CASES ARE BEING UNDERCONFIDENT SO YOU'RE SAYING AH I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU DO KIND OF KNOW AND YOU GET IT RIGHT A LOT
utt_0053 utt 259.99 272.82 -X OF THE TIME AND BEING OVERCONFIDENT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE OH I DEFINITELY KNOW THE ANSWER AND THEN YOU GET IT RIGHT LIKE twenty% OF THE TIME. SO. THAT'S CALIBRATION IN A NUTSHELL. NOW IF YOU REMEMBER,
utt_0055 utt 272.82 282.33 -X THE PAPER TITLE TALKED ABOUT *LINGUISTIC* CALIBRATION, SO THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT, I GUESS... SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT? USUALLY WHAT YOU SEE IN PAPERS THAT TALK ABOUT
utt_0057 utt 282.33 294.54 -X CALIBRATION IS WHAT I'M CALLING *PROBABILISTIC* CALIBRATION---REALLY SAYING THAT CERTAINTY IS SORT OF A NUMBER THAT COMES OUT OF THE MODEL. LIKE IF YOU HAVE SOME SOFTMAX, YOUR SOFTMAX TELLS YOU
utt_0059 utt 294.54 306.33 -X IT'S SOME PERCENTAGE THIS SOME PERCENTAGE THAT AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT AS YOUR CERTAINTY OF THE MODEL. YOU CAN BUCKET IT INTO HOWEVER MANY BUCKETS YOU LIKE AND TAKE THE CORRECTNESS AND DRAW THESE LITTLE LINES AND YOU WANT TO STAY CLOSE TO THE DIAGONAL AND IT'S GREAT...
utt_0062 utt 306.33 321.15 -X BUT I WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT I CALL LINGUISTIC CALIBRATION---AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT I WANT TO LOOK AT THE ACTUAL STRING THAT IS GENERATED, AT THE ACTUAL UTTERANCE THAT IS COMING OUT OF OUR MODEL.
utt_0065 utt 321.43 328.47 -X SO I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SOFTMAX PREDICTION, ARE YOU USING A SPARSE MODEL, ARE YOU BEAM SEARCHING,
utt_0067 utt 333.11 346.44 -X LOOK AT THAT STRING AND ASK A HUMAN TO ANNOTATE WHAT THE CONFIDENCE EXPRESSED IN THAT STRING LINGUISTICALLY IS. SO REALLY WE CAN THINK ABOUT IT AS THE AMOUNT OF HEDGING THAT WE'RE GOING TO
utt_0069 utt 346.44 360.38 -X HAVE IN THERE, THE AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY EXPRESSED THAT WAY. I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THREE BUCKETS FOR THIS PAPER: DON'T KNOW, LOW CONFIDENCE, HIGH CONFIDENCE---AND I DRAW THEM AS BAR PLOTS JUST TO KIND OF SET IT APART FROM THE PROBABILISTIC CALIBRATION CASE, BUT IT'S REALLY THE SAME IDEA.
utt_0072 utt 361.81 374.23 -X YEAH, SO WE GOTTA ASK HUMANS, BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS KIND OF CONCEPT OF TRYING TO GET AT WHAT THE *STRING* CONTAINS INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW WELL OUR CHATBOT IS CALIBRATED.
utt_0075 utt 374.45 379.42 -X SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY LINGUISTIC CALIBRATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.
utt_0076 utt 379.51 391.96 -X THIS IS A RESULT OF DOING THAT FOR BLENDERBOT AND YOU ALREADY SEE... IT'S PRETTY TERRIBLE, LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON HERE! DON'T KNOW, zero% CORRECT, OKAY, THAT'S FINE, LOW CONFIDENCE, two% CORRECT,
utt_0078 utt 392.41 399.84 -X NOT GREAT, BUT HIGH CONFIDENCE thirteen% CORRECT IS AWFUL! SO THE BOT IS WILDLY OVERCONFIDENT.
utt_0080 utt 404.67 415.26 -X THE ONLY WAY THAT WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IS IF THERE WAS SOME WAY TO TELL THAT THE BOT IS MAKING UP AN ANSWER. SO NOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT: DOES THE BOT KNOW THAT IT IS BULLSHITTING?
utt_0082 utt 415.70 425.87 -X IS THERE A SIGNAL IN THE BOT SOMEWHERE THAT CAN TELL US THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT CONFIDENT AND JUST FOR SOME REASON GENERATES A HIGH CONFIDENCE ANSWER? AND TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION
utt_0084 utt 426.20 436.89 -X WE NEED TO DISSECT A BRAIN ESSENTIALLY AND THAT IS WHAT I AM GOING TO CALL HERE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF METACOGNITION THAT'S A TERM THAT'S USED OUTSIDE OF AI, TOO, IT MEANS A LOT OF THINGS,
utt_0086 utt 437.02 448.86 -X YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S A LITTLE GRAND TO USE IT HERE, BUT I THINK IT KIND OF FITS. METACOGNITION MEANS AWARENESS AND ANALYSIS OF ONE'S OWN LEARNING OR THINKING PROCESSES---THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE
utt_0089 utt 453.61 463.66 -X WHETHER IT'S REALLY CERTAIN. AND THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO WORK IS IF WE HAVE THIS KIND OF CHATBOT PIPELINE---QUESTION IN ANSWER OUT---WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS OF OUR CHATBOT
utt_0091 utt 463.77 474.11 -X TOGETHER WITH A QUESTION AND ANSWER AND FEED THEM INTO THIS MAGIC CRYSTAL BALL. I'M GOING TO CALL THAT CRYSTAL BALL A CALIBRATOR FOR REASONS THAT'LL BECOME CLEAR IN A BUNCH OF SLIDES---BUT WHAT I
utt_0093 utt 474.11 485.89 -X WANT THIS CRYSTAL BALL TO DO IS I WANT IT TO TELL ME: WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT THIS ANSWER IS ACTUALLY A CORRECT ANSWER FOR THAT QUESTION. IF THERE IS A SIGNAL IN THE BOT (LIKE IF THE BOT KNOWS THAT
utt_0095 utt 485.89 500.25 -X IT IS BULLSHITTING) THIS SHOULD BE POSSIBLE, RIGHT? BUT IF THE BOT TRULY IS TRYING ITS BEST AND IS LIKE I THOUGHT I WAS CONFIDENT BUT I TURNED OUT TO BE INCORRECT NOT MY FAULT THEN THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA GET ANY USEFUL SIGNAL OUT OF THIS, RIGHT? SO THIS WILL SERVE AS
utt_0098 utt 500.25 506.65 -X A WAY TO PROBE WHAT'S IN THE BOT AND IF WE CAN DO THIS TASK: IF WE CAN HELP CALIBRATE THE BOT.
utt_0099 utt 507.64 517.53 -X OKAY, SO I'M GOING TO SHOW THE RESULTS AGAIN IN THE STYLE OF A CALIBRATION PLOT, BECAUSE THAT IS KIND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING: ON THE X-AXIS I'M GOING TO SHOW WHAT THIS CRYSTAL BALL THAT WE'VE TRAINED
utt_0101 utt 517.95 532.58 -X BELIEVES IS THE CHANCE OF CORRECTNESS AND ON THE Y-AXIS I'M GOING TO AGAIN SHOW WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CORRECTNESS IN A GIVEN BUCKET IS. NOW SINCE EVERYTHING IS KIND OF TERRIBLE AS WE'VE SEEN I'M GOING TO DO THIS IN LOG SPACE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.
utt_0104 utt 532.92 544.90 -X AND HERE'S THE AMAZING RESULT THAT MADE US CRY TEARS OF JOY WHEN IT CAME OUT: WE HAVE GREAT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO. SO IT IS REALLY POSSIBLE TO TRAIN THIS THIS CRYSTAL BALL, TO
utt_0106 utt 544.90 552.51 -X TRAIN THIS CALIBRATOR TO TELL US WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT THIS ANSWER IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE RIGHT.
utt_0107 utt 552.96 557.47 -X IN OTHER WORDS THE BOT KNOWS THAT IT'S BULLSHITTING---NOT IN THE SENSE OF KNOWLEDGE,
utt_0108 utt 557.47 572.29 -X BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BULLSHIT INVOLVED. I LOVE SAYING THE WORD BULLSHIT BY THE WAY AND I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT IT BECAME A THEME AS I MADE THESE SLIDES. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS WE NEED TO INTERVENE AND WE DO THAT THROUGH CONTROLLED GENERATION. SO THE RECIPE WE'RE GOING
utt_0111 utt 572.29 583.49 -X TO FOLLOW IS ESSENTIALLY WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING OUR PIPELINE AS WE'VE SEEN QUESTION IN POTENTIALLY BULLSHIT ANSWER OUT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FEED IT INTO OUR CALIBRATOR (THE ONE THAT TELLS US HOW
utt_0113 utt 583.49 589.10 -X LIKELY IS IT TO BE CORRECT) AND BASED ON WHAT IT TELLS US WE DECIDE WHICH OF THREE CATEGORIES
utt_0114 utt 589.15 599.20 -X DOES THIS EXAMPLE FALL INTO: DON'T KNOW, LOW CONFIDENCE, HIGH CONFIDENCE. SO ONLY THE ONES WHERE THE CALIBRATOR IS LIKE OH YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT ONE RIGHT, OKAY,
utt_0116 utt 599.20 609.89 -X THEN WE'RE GOING TO GENERATE A HIGH CONFIDENCE ANSWER FOR THESE---AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE HERE WITH A FINE-TUNED VERSION OF THE CHATBOT THAT IS CONTROLLABLE USING
utt_0118 utt 609.89 622.98 -X THIS DON'T-KNOW-LOW-HIGH AS CONTROL TOKENS. SO NOW GET THE SAME QUESTION IN, WE FEED THE CONTROL TOKEN IN THAT SAYS THIS HOW CERTAIN YOU SHOULD ANSWER, AND WE GET A LINGUISTICALLY CALIBRATED
utt_0120 utt 622.98 629.73 -X ANSWER OUT OF IT. NOW TRAINING THIS FINETUNED MODEL IS REALLY INTERESTING AND I MADE BEAUTIFUL
utt_0121 utt 630.01 642.91 -X ANIMATIONS FOR IT BEFORE I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL, SO I'M GOING TO SKIP THROUGH THESE ANIMATIONS... BUT LOOK AT THEM! THERE'S ARROWS! I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. YOU CAN CHECK THEM OUT ON MY WEBSITE: THE SLIDES ARE ALL THERE, SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED TAKE A LOOK AT
utt_0124 utt 642.91 653.89 -X THAT. I'M GOING TO SKIP AHEAD TO THE RESULTS SLIDE AND SEE WELL HOW WELL DOES THIS MODEL ACTUALLY WORK NOW THAT WE'VE DONE IT. AND IF YOU REMEMBER THESE WITH THE NUMBERS THAT THE VANILLA MODEL GOT
utt_0126 utt 654.65 661.44 -X (thirteen% OF HIGH CONFIDENCE ANSWERS WERE CORRECT) NOW OUR FULLY LINGUISTICALLY CALIBRATED PIPELINE GETS
utt_0127 utt 661.47 671.30 -X two% OF THE DON'T KNOW ONES CORRECT, WHICH, OKAY, COOL, five% OF LOW CONFIDENCE (ALL RIGHT THAT'S AN INCREASE) AND IN HIGH CONFIDENCE WE INCREASE FROM thirteen% TO thirty-nine% WHICH IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT
utt_0129 utt 675.26 686.08 -X BUT CLEARLY THERE'S A LONG WAYS TO GO YET UM TO GET TO THAT HUNDRED PERCENT WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE IN THE HIGH CONFIDENCE CASES. SO, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF STUFF,
utt_0131 utt 686.08 695.24 -X THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. THIS IS REALLY IN A WAY LIKE A PILOT STUDY KIND OF THING WHERE WE CHOSE THE SIMPLEST TOOL THAT WE COULD COME UP WITH FOR ANYTHING WE WERE DOING,
utt_0133 utt 695.24 700.07 -X SO I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT THAT COULD BE DONE HERE (IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN).
utt_0134 utt 700.07 704.29 -X IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT, YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT TO READ THE PAPER BECAUSE THERE'S A TON MORE STUFF:
utt_0135 utt 704.83 709.97 -X THERE'S LOTS OF QUALITATIVE EXAMPLES WE HAVE N-GRAM ANALYSES SURFACE PATTERNS
utt_0136 utt 710.46 716.68 -X I TRAINED SOME SPARSE SVMS (FOR THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO STILL REMEMBER WHAT SVMS ARE...
utt_0137 utt 717.22 725.72 -X FUN STUFF) WE HAVE A MUCH FINER GRAINED ANNOTATION SCHEME THAT REALLY TRIES TO ANTICIPATE HUMAN ANNOTATORS, THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT ABOUT THAT IN THE PAPER
utt_0139 utt 725.76 735.52 -X WE HAVE AUTOMATED HEURISTICS FOR CERTAINTY AND CORRECTNESS THAT WE USE TO SPEED UP TRAINING PURPOSES OTHER BASELINES MORE CHAT-BOT MODELS AND MOST INTERESTINGLY WE HAVE A CALIBRATOR THAT'S
utt_0141 utt 735.52 746.76 -X BASED ON BERT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY USE MODEL REPRESENTATIONS---SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW WELL THAT ONE DOES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO READ THE PAPER! AND THAT'S ALL FOR ME, SO WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS!
utt_0143 utt 747.71 759.69 -X [QUESTION ASKER one:] THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INTERESTING TALK! [SPEAKER INTRODUCES
utt_0144 utt 759.69 773.00 -X THEMSELVES] ONE THING IS THAT BLENDERBOT WAS ORIGINALLY PRE-TRAINED BY THE REDDIT DATA AND ALSO FINETUNED BY A BUNCH OF THE BLENDER DATA AND SO THERE'S THE... HOW LARGE WAS YOUR ANNOTATION
utt_0146 utt 773.00 778.60 -X BECAUSE HOW GENERALIZABLE IS THIS RESULT COMPARED TO ALL THE DATA IT WAS TRAINED BEFORE ON.
utt_0147 utt 778.60 784.20 -X [SABRINA:] RIGHT, SO, IN TERMS OF DATA SET WE TRY TO MAKE USE OF ALL OF TRIVIAQA, WHICH IS LIKE,
utt_0148 utt 784.77 797.70 -X WHAT, sixty thousand, seventy thousand QUESTIONS, I THINK. AND SO FOR OUR EVALUATIONS THE EVALUATIONS ARE ALL THREE TIMES HUMAN ANNOTATED AND WE KEEP WHERE THERE IS MAJORITY CONSENSUS. FOR THE
utt_0150 utt 797.70 807.01 -X TRAINING PURPOSES ANNOTATING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS WILL BE PRETTY COST PROHIBITIVE WHICH IS WHERE THE AUTOMATED HEURISTICS ARE COMING IN THAT WE BUILT (AND VERIFIED THAT THEY WORK WELL
utt_0152 utt 807.01 813.16 -X ENOUGH FOR THESE PURPOSES). SO THAT MANY OF THESE THINGS LIKE TELLING THE CERTAINTY YOU CAN DO A BIT
utt_0154 utt 816.81 823.59 -X GREAT RESULTS. CORRECTNESS, YOU CAN STRING MATCH, FUZZY MATCH, AND THAT KIND OF WORKS, SOMETIMES,
utt_0155 utt 823.59 827.46 -X SO THESE KINDS OF TRICKS REALLY HELP YOU GET A LOT OF THE DATA INTO YOUR TRAINING PIPELINE.
utt_0156 utt 827.46 831.27 -X [QUESTION ASKER one:] I SEE, SO ARE THOSE LIKE MOSTLY FACTUAL QUESTIONS OR...
utt_0157 utt 831.27 837.61 -X [SABRINA:] YES, THIS IS ALL LIKE TRIVIA QUESTIONS AS YOU'D EXPECT ON JEOPARDY OR ANY OTHER KIND OF TRIVIA-BASED GAME, YEAH.
utt_0159 utt 837.61 839.24 -X [QUESTION ASKER one:] THANK YOU.
utt_0160 utt 839.27 840.97 -X [SABRINA:] YEAH, THANKS.
utt_0161 utt 840.97 843.21 -X [SESSION CHAIR:] WE CAN TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION.
utt_0162 utt 843.21 853.19 -X [QUESTION ASKER two:] HI, SO I WANT TO ACTUALLY ASK ABOUT YOUR CALIBRATOR ITSELF. SO HOW WELL DID YOU TEST THE CALIBRATORS TO KNOW THAT IT CAN REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF... IT CAN
utt_0164 utt 853.19 861.45 -X ACTUALLY TEST FOR A WIDE RANGE OF LANGUAGE AND LIKE HOW MUCH HUMAN ANNOTATION DID YOU USE THERE OR LIKE WHAT PART OF IT WAS AUTOMATIC SO THAT THIS QUESTION.
utt_0166 utt 861.45 865.19 -X [SABRINA:] SO IF I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION CORRECTLY, LIKE, YOU'RE WONDERING, LIKE,
utt_0167 utt 865.19 868.78 -X HOW WELL THIS CALIBRATOR GENERALIZES TO, LIKE, NON-TRIVIAL QA QUESTIONS? I THINK
utt_0169 utt 873.25 883.86 -X BECAUSE WHEN I DID LIKE SOME INITIAL SURVEYING I REALLY DIDN'T FIND MUCH THAT FOLLOWED A FORM THAT I FIGURED WOULD BE LIKE AMENABLE FOR THE CHATBOT. I THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER INTERESTING TO DO THAT
utt_0171 utt 883.86 897.80 -X AND ONE THING THAT WE ALSO DID THINK ABOUT---AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME ABOUT THAT IN THE PAPER---IS HOW WELL THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO DO ON LIKE HUMAN CONVERSATION THAT DOESN'T... LIKE I USUALLY DON'T WALK UP TO A PERSON AND ASK THEM A TRIVIA QUESTION, RIGHT? SO THERE'S DEFINITELY
utt_0174 utt 897.80 902.76 -X STILL SOME DISCONNECT HERE WHICH IS WHY I THINK THIS IS LIKE A SORT OF EARLY MOTIVATIONAL THING,
utt_0176 utt 907.24 912.20 -X TAKE AWAY FROM THIS: THAT LINGUISTIC CALIBRATION IS A THING AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO CALIBRATE
utt_0177 utt 912.55 917.42 -X WITH KIND OF PROBING BASED AND EVEN NON-PROBING BASED METHODS, YEAH.
utt_0178 utt 917.42 919.95 -6.0375 [SESSION CHAIR:] LET'S THANK THE SPEAKER ONCE AGAIN.
