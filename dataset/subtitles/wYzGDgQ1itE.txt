utt_0000 utt 0.38 4.62 -X HI, I AM ANNA FARIHA FROM UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST.
utt_0001 utt 4.78 10.22 -X TODAY, I AM GOING TO DEMONSTRATE OUR WORK EXTUNE THAT EXPLAINS TUPLE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0002 utt 10.35 16.18 -X THIS WORK WAS DONE WHILE I WAS INTERNING AT MICROSOFT WITH ASHISH TIWARI, ARJUN RADHAKRISHA,
utt_0003 utt 16.18 17.26 -X AND SUMIT GULWANI.
utt_0004 utt 17.64 19.86 -X FIRST, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEM.
utt_0005 utt 20.11 26.48 -X SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE TRAINED YOUR FAVORITE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL WITH THESE COLORFUL APPLES TO PREDICT THEIR COLOR.
utt_0007 utt 26.76 32.24 -X NOW YOU DEPLOY YOUR MODEL AND YOUR MODEL SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL FOR THESE NEW APPLES.
utt_0008 utt 32.24 33.84 -X SO FAR, SO GOOD.
utt_0009 utt 34.44 39.15 -X BUT NOW, YOU ENCOUNTER THIS NEW THING, A STRANGE WATERMELON WEDGE!
utt_0010 utt 39.28 44.15 -X NOW THE QUESTION IS, WOULD YOU TRUST YOUR MODEL'S PREDICTION ON THIS?
utt_0011 utt 44.94 54.58 -X IN DATA-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING, WE SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER TUPLES, FOR WHICH, THE LEARNED MODEL IS VERY MUCH LIKELY TO MAKE AN INCORRECT PREDICTION.
utt_0013 utt 54.80 61.11 -X THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE TUPLE IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE MODEL HAS SEEN SO FAR.
utt_0014 utt 61.11 66.64 -X THESE ARE NON-CONFORMING TUPLES, THAT IS, THEY DON'T CONFORM TO THE TRAINING DATA.
utt_0015 utt 67.28 75.86 -X A KEY APPLICATION OF DETECTING NON-CONFORMANCE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WE SHOULD TRUST PREDICTIONS MADE BY MACHINE LEARNED MODELS AND WHEN NOT.
utt_0017 utt 76.17 84.08 -X THIS BECOMES AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL ISSUE WHEN HIGH-STAKE DECISIONS ARE TAKEN BASED ON THESE PREDICTIONS.
utt_0019 utt 84.08 88.56 -X WRONG PREDICTIONS MADE BY MACHINE LEARNED MODELS HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS ISSUES IN THE PAST,
utt_0020 utt 88.91 95.63 -X SUCH AS UNSAFE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND UNSAFE SELF-DRIVING, WHICH EVEN CAUSED HUMAN DEATH!
utt_0021 utt 95.63 104.21 -X MANY OF THESE FAILURES ARE DUE TO NON-CONFORMANCE OF THE NEW DATA TUPLE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAINING DATA, SOMETHING THE MODEL HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
utt_0023 utt 104.24 108.37 -X SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS, HOW CAN WE DETECT TUPLE NON-CONFORMANCE?
utt_0024 utt 108.50 113.72 -X AND ONCE WE HAVE DETECTED THAT A TUPLE IS NON-CONFORMING, THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHY?
utt_0025 utt 113.87 115.89 -X WHAT IS CAUSING THE NON-CONFORMANCE?
utt_0026 utt 116.21 125.68 -X THE FOCUS OF THIS DEMO IS ON THE EXPLANATION, BUT BEFORE THAT, I AM GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON THE DETECTION TECHNIQUES ON WHICH EXTUNE IS BUILT.
utt_0028 utt 125.84 131.22 -X TO DETECT NON-CONFORMANCE, WE USE OUR PREVIOUS WORK ON DATA INVARIANTS.
utt_0029 utt 131.31 139.03 -X DATA INVARIANTS ARE A SET OF CONSTRAINTS THAT CAPTURE THE COMMON PROPERTIES OR INVARIANTS OF THE DATA.
utt_0031 utt 139.41 147.03 -X TO DETECT NON-CONFORMANCE, WE SIMPLY CHECK WHETHER A NEW TUPLE SATISFIES OR VIOLATES THE DATA INVARIANTS.
utt_0033 utt 147.03 151.06 -X WHEN A TUPLE VIOLATES THE DATA INVARIANTS, THEN IT IS NON-CONFORMING.
utt_0034 utt 151.15 156.98 -X AS AN EXAMPLE, CONSIDER THIS HEALTH DATASET WITH THREE ATTRIBUTES: HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND BMI.
utt_0035 utt 157.33 162.71 -X A SIMPLE DATA INVARIANT ON THIS DATASET IS THAT BMI SHOULD BE BETWEEN ten AND forty.
utt_0036 utt 163.63 172.72 -X A SLIGHTLY MORE COMPLEX DATA INVARIANT IS THAT twenty-eight TIMES HEIGHT MINUS WEIGHT SHOULD BE WITHIN THE RANGE MINUS forty AND thirty.
utt_0038 utt 172.94 186.49 -X I WILL SKIP THE DETAILS OF DATA INVARIANTS AND THE TECHNIQUES WE USE TO COMPUTE GOOD DATA INVARIANTS IN THIS TALK, BUT AT A HIGH LEVEL, DATA INVARIANTS ARE CONSTRAINTS ON LINEAR COMBINATION OF ATTRIBUTES.
utt_0041 utt 187.09 190.07 -X NOW SUPPOSE THAT A NEW TUPLE ARRIVES WITH BMI two hundred and thirty-one.
utt_0042 utt 191.12 197.78 -X THIS TUPLE IS CLEARLY NON-CONFORMING BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE DATA INVARIANT THAT STATES THE TYPICAL RANGE OF BMI.
utt_0044 utt 198.03 200.21 -X NOW ANOTHER TUPLE ARRIVES WITH BMI twenty,zero.
utt_0045 utt 201.49 205.43 -X THIS TUPLE IS WAY MORE NON-CONFORMING THAN THE PREVIOUS TUPLE.
utt_0046 utt 205.52 211.77 -X TO CAPTURE THE DEGREE OF NON-CONFORMANCE, WE MEASURE HOW MUCH IT VIOLATED THE DATA INVARIANTS.
utt_0047 utt 211.86 215.64 -X MORE VIOLATIONS IMPLY MORE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0048 utt 216.08 222.04 -X SO FAR, I HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE DETECT AND MEASURE THE DEGREE OF TUPLE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0049 utt 222.04 228.85 -X THE GOAL OF THIS DEMO IS TO PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION, SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF THESE NON-CONFORMANCES.
utt_0051 utt 230.16 239.41 -X SPECIFICALLY, EXTUNE HAS THREE GOALS: FIRST, TO RANK AND VISUALIZE THE NON-CONFORMING TUPLES BASED ON THEIR DEGREE OF NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0053 utt 239.73 244.15 -X SECOND, TO PROVIDE TUPLE-LEVEL EXPLANATION FOR NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0054 utt 244.15 250.61 -X THAT IS, GIVEN A NON-CONFORMING TUPLE, WHICH OF ITS ATTRIBUTES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0056 utt 250.83 262.10 -X AND THIRD, TO DO THE SAME FOR THE ENTIRE DATASET, AND NOT JUST ONE TUPLE THAT IS, SHOWING THE AGGREGATED RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH ATTRIBUTE ACROSS THE WHOLE DATASET.
utt_0058 utt 262.71 269.82 -X I WILL NOW GIVE A HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE INNER WORKING OF EXTUNE AND THEN PROCEED TO THE DEMONSTRATION.
utt_0060 utt 269.82 272.44 -X RANKING NON-CONFORMING TUPLES IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.
utt_0061 utt 272.44 279.00 -X WE COMPUTE INVARIANT VIOLATION SCORES FOR ALL TUPLES AND THEN SORT THEM BY DECREASING ORDER OF VIOLATION SCORES.
utt_0063 utt 279.00 287.90 -X FOR TUPLE-LEVEL EXPLANATION, WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ATTRIBUTE, OR INTERACTION OF ATTRIBUTES OF A TUPLE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0065 utt 287.99 293.56 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IS THE ABNORMALLY HIGH BMI CAUSING THIS TUPLE'S NON-CONFORMANCE?
utt_0066 utt 293.68 296.63 -X OR IS IT AN INTERACTION BETWEEN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT?
utt_0067 utt 297.17 309.53 -X THE KEY IDEA BEHIND EXTUNE IS TO PERFORM AN INTERVENTION, THAT IS, TO CHANGE A VALUE IN THE NON-CONFORMING TUPLE AND SET IT TO THE ATTRIBUTE-MEAN OVER THE DATASET, AND THEN
utt_0069 utt 309.53 313.82 -X OBSERVE THE CAUSAL EFFECT, HOW IT AFFECTS THE TUPLE'S NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0070 utt 313.91 322.42 -X IF THE INTERVENTION ON AN ATTRIBUTE MAKES THE TUPLE NO LONGER NON-CONFORMING, THEN WE BLAME THAT ATTRIBUTE FOR CAUSING ITS NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0072 utt 322.42 327.83 -X BUT IN MANY CASES, MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES CAUSE TUPLE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0073 utt 327.83 337.27 -X IF INTERVENING ON A SINGLE ATTRIBUTE DOES NOT WORK, THEN WE TRY INTERVENING ON DIFFERENT SUBSETS OF ATTRIBUTES UNTIL WE CAN MAKE THE TUPLE CONFORMING.
utt_0075 utt 337.43 350.11 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS CASE, BOTH HEIGHT AND WEIGHT WOULD GET THE BLAME AND SHARE EQUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAUSING NON-CONFORMANCE, BECAUSE THIS PERSON IS TOO TALL AND HAS A VERY LOW WEIGHT.
utt_0078 utt 350.13 353.79 -X EXTUNE'S PRINCIPLE IS BASED ON ACTUAL CAUSALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.
utt_0079 utt 353.97 359.00 -X I WILL SKIP THE DETAILS IN THIS TALK, BUT PLEASE REFER TO OUR PAPER FOR MORE DETAILS ON THIS.
utt_0081 utt 359.29 361.59 -X I WILL NOW PROCEED TO DEMONSTRATE EXTUNE.
utt_0082 utt 362.17 364.31 -X SO LET'S GET STARTED WITH THE DEMO.
utt_0083 utt 364.60 367.99 -X EXTUNE'S INTERFACE IS BUILT WITHIN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.
utt_0084 utt 368.12 370.49 -X AT FIRST, I AM GOING TO UPLOAD THE DATASET.
utt_0085 utt 370.49 378.23 -X I AM SELECTING THE CARDIO DATASET WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE AND WHETHER THEY HAVE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE OR NOT.
utt_0087 utt 378.87 380.70 -X THE DATASET IS NOW UPLOADED.
utt_0088 utt 381.75 385.27 -X NOW I AM GOING TO SPLIT THE DATASET INTO TWO PARTITIONS.
utt_0089 utt 385.30 393.59 -X IN ONE PARTITION, I AM GOING TO KEEP ONLY THE HEALTHY PEOPLE WITH NO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND I WILL USE THIS AS THE REFERENCE DATA.
utt_0091 utt 394.97 399.45 -X HERE, A zero VALUE FOR THE ATTRIBUTE CARDIO MEANS THAT THE PERSON IS HEALTHY.
utt_0092 utt 399.93 407.29 -X MY GOAL HERE IS TO SEE IF PEOPLE WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONFORMS TO HEALTHY PEOPLE, AND IF NOT, WHY.
utt_0094 utt 408.15 413.92 -X NOW I AM GOING TO GIVE EXTUNE THE HEALTHY PEOPLE'S DATA AND LET IT LEARN THE DATA INVARIANTS FROM IT.
utt_0096 utt 414.81 416.70 -X SO THE LEARNING IS DONE.
utt_0097 utt 416.79 419.80 -X I AM NOW UPLOADING THE CARDIAC PATIENT'S DATA.
utt_0098 utt 419.86 425.47 -X SO I WANT TO SEE THE TOP ten MOST NON-CONFORMING PEOPLE AMONG THESE CARDIAC PATIENTS.
utt_0099 utt 426.07 427.74 -X AND THIS IS WHAT WE FIND.
utt_0100 utt 427.74 433.79 -X THE TUPLES ARE RANKED FROM MOST NON-CONFORMING TO LEAST NON-CONFORMING.
utt_0101 utt 434.10 439.87 -X AND THE DEGREE OF NON-CONFORMANCE IS SHOWN IN THIS VIOLATION COLUMN.
utt_0102 utt 439.93 441.63 -X NOW LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.
utt_0103 utt 442.10 446.01 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, THE COLOR INTENSITIES OF THESE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT.
utt_0104 utt 446.17 454.40 -X A DARKER COLOR MEANS MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-CONFORMANCE, AND A LIGHTER COLOR MEANS LESS RESPONSIBILITY FOR NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0106 utt 455.00 457.08 -X SO LET'S FOCUS ON THIS ROW.
utt_0107 utt 457.46 465.50 -X THE PRIMARY REASON WHY THIS PERSON IS NOT CONFORMING TO HEALTHY PEOPLE, IS THAT SHE HAS AN ABNORMALLY HIGH WEIGHT.
utt_0109 utt 465.91 467.87 -X HERE, WEIGHTS ARE IN KILOGRAMS.
utt_0110 utt 468.06 470.24 -X SO two hundred KILOGRAM IS ABOUT four hundred and forty POUNDS.
utt_0111 utt 470.43 474.37 -X SO NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THIS OTHER ROW.
utt_0112 utt 474.87 481.57 -X THIS PERSON IS NON-CONFORMING BECAUSE HIS SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH.
utt_0114 utt 481.57 487.39 -X A HEALTHY PERSON'S SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE SHOULD BE ABOUT one hundred and twenty AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE SHOULD BE ABOUT eighty.
utt_0116 utt 487.99 492.99 -X FOR THIS PERSON, IT IS two hundred AND one hundred and seventy, WHICH IS REALLY REALLY HIGH.
utt_0117 utt 493.79 506.62 -X SO HERE, EXTUNE IS EXPLAINING NOT ONLY WHO ARE NON-CONFORMING BUT ALSO, ONE, HOW MUCH THEY ARE NON-CONFORMING IN THIS VIOLATION COLUMN, AND TWO, WHAT IS THE RELATIVE RESPONSIBILITY
utt_0119 utt 506.62 509.53 -X OF EACH ATTRIBUTES FOR CAUSING THE NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0120 utt 510.62 520.03 -X NOW I ALSO WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS EACH ATTRIBUTE'S SHARE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR CAUSING THE OVERALL NON-CONFORMANCE, IN THE ENTIRE SET OF CARDIAC PATIENTS.
utt_0122 utt 521.31 522.49 -X AND HERE WE GO.
utt_0123 utt 523.64 531.81 -X AS YOU CAN SEE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE HERE IS IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST RESPONSIBLE ATTRIBUTE FOR THE OVERALL NON-CONFORMANCE.
utt_0125 utt 531.96 534.75 -X THIS IS FOLLOWED BY DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE.
utt_0126 utt 534.75 542.43 -X THIS IS VERY MEANINGFUL, SINCE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ABNORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE IS THE PRIMARY INDICATOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.
utt_0128 utt 542.75 547.94 -X SO THESE TWO ATTRIBUTES ARE FOLLOWED BY WEIGHT, CHOLESTEROL LEVEL, AND SMOKING HABIT.
utt_0129 utt 547.94 553.41 -X THESE THREE ATTRIBUTES ARE ALSO WELL-KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.
utt_0130 utt 553.56 557.86 -X EXTUNE IS GENERATING THESE EXPLANATIONS ENTIRELY IN A DATA-DRIVEN MANNER.
utt_0131 utt 558.11 564.74 -X THERE WAS NO A-PRIORI KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR HIGH CHOLESTEROL BEING KEY CAUSE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.
utt_0133 utt 564.86 570.34 -X IT'S ALL JUST BASED ON DATA, AND EXTUNE WOULD WORK JUST AS WELL FOR ANY OTHER DATASET.
utt_0134 utt 571.10 575.74 -X LASTLY, I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY WE MADE USING EXTUNE.
utt_0135 utt 575.90 582.05 -X WE APPLIED EXTUNE ON THE UNITED STATE'S STATE-WISE COVID PATIENT STATISTICS DATASET.
utt_0136 utt 582.30 584.48 -X THIS WAS DONE DURING LATE MARCH.
utt_0137 utt 585.08 591.14 -X WE LEARNED INVARIANTS ON DATA OVER A WEEK AND TRIED TO FIND ANOMALIES IN THE NEXT WEEK'S DATA.
utt_0139 utt 591.68 601.57 -X DURING TRAINING, A VERY SIMPLE INVARIANT WAS LEARNED: THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS SHOULD BE EQUAL TO THE SUM OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CASES.
utt_0141 utt 602.11 608.22 -X WHEN WE TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE NON-CONFORMING TUPLES, WE FOUND A DATA-ENTRY ERROR DUE TO A TYPO.
utt_0143 utt 608.70 615.84 -X THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS FOR NEW JERSEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN two hundred and ninety-eight, BUT INSTEAD, IT WAS MISTYPED AS two hundred and eighteen.
utt_0145 utt 616.35 619.55 -X AND EXTUNE CORRECTLY EXPLAINED THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR.
utt_0146 utt 619.87 631.52 -X THE FINAL POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT IDENTIFYING A TUPLE AS NON-CONFORMING ONLY MEANS THAT WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT PREDICTIONS MADE ON THAT TUPLE BY ANY MACHINE LEARNED MODEL,
utt_0148 utt 631.87 636.26 -X SINCE THE MODEL NEVER SAW SUCH PATTERNS DURING TRAINING.
utt_0149 utt 636.26 639.14 -X IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE DATA IS INCORRECT.
utt_0150 utt 639.23 645.44 -X BUT DATA ERROR IS ONE POSSIBLE REASON FOR TUPLE NON-CONFORMANCE, AND EXTUNE CAN LOCATE THOSE ERRORS.
utt_0152 utt 646.08 647.55 -X THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
utt_0153 utt 647.55 651.04 -3.7044 WE WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION OVER THE COMMUNICATION CHANNEL.
