utt_0000 utt 3.92 15.62 -X MY NAME IS WENRUI. I‚ÄôM FROM INSTITUTE OF COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY. IN THIS PAPER WE PROPOSE DIVERSITY-MEASURABLE ANOMALY DETECTION FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE BIG CHALLENGE ABOUT THE
utt_0002 utt 15.62 21.07 -X TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RECONSTRUCTING DIVERSE NORMALS AND DETECTING UNKNOWN ANOMALIES.
utt_0003 utt 21.07 32.18 -X THE KEY IS TO FIND A PROPER MEASUREMENT OF DIVERSITY THAT IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF ANOMALY. WE THEREFORE MODEL NORMAL DIVERSITY RESTRICTLY WITH THE SUPPRESSION
utt_0005 utt 32.18 42.74 -X TO UNDESIRED INFORMATION. SO THAT WE DO NOT NEED TO FIGHT AGAINST IMPERFECT RECONSTRUCTION OF NORMALS OR UNDESIRED RECONSTRUCTION OF ANOMALIES. BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DETECTED MORE
utt_0007 utt 42.74 48.63 -X ACCURATELY BY THE DIVERSITY MEASURE TOGETHER WITH THE RECONSTRUCTION ERROR. SPECIFICALLY,
utt_0008 utt 48.63 54.48 -X WE ESTIMATE MULTI-SCALE DEFORMATION FIELDS FROM RECONSTRUCTED REFERENCE TO ORIGINAL INPUT.
utt_0009 utt 54.80 60.02 -X THIS MODEL AND MEASURE THE GEOMETRICAL DIVERSITY TO IMPLEMENT ABOVE FRAMEWORK.
utt_0010 utt 62.42 69.46 -X RECONSTRUCTION-BASED ANOMALY DETECTION MODELS ACHIEVE THEIR PURPOSE BY SUPPRESSING THE GENERALIZATION ABILITY FOR ANOMALY.
utt_0012 utt 69.87 82.39 -X HOWEVER, DIVERSE NORMAL PATTERNS ARE CONSEQUENTLY NOT RECONSTRUCTED WELL. WE SHOW AN INTUITIVE CASE IN THE LAST TWO ROWS THAT THE SEVERELY DEFORMED NORMAL SAMPLE ‚Äúseven‚Äù, HAS EVEN HIGHER
utt_0014 utt 82.39 88.69 -X RECONSTRUCTION ERROR THAN THE ABNORMAL SAMPLE ‚Äúfour‚Äù, THIS ALSO KNOWN AS ANOMALY-LIKE SAMPLE.
utt_0015 utt 91.41 96.76 -X ALTHOUGH SOME EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM BY MODELING SAMPLE DIVERSITY,
utt_0016 utt 97.01 108.60 -X THEY SUFFER FROM SHORTCUT LEARNING DUE TO UNDESIRED TRANSMISSION OF ABNORMAL INFORMATION WITHOUT ANY CONSTRAINT TO THE DIVERSITY. THE TOY EXPERIMENT ON MNIST SHOWS THAT
utt_0018 utt 108.60 114.90 -X MEMORY NETWORK WITHOUT DIVERSITY-MODELING CANNOT GUARANTEE THE INTRA-CLASS RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY,
utt_0019 utt 115.06 128.89 -X WHICH MISDIRECTS THE MODEL TO OBTAINS AVERAGE MEMORY‚Äù WITH FUZZY RECONSTRUCTION AND LOWER DISCRIMINATION ABILITY. IN CONTRAST, THE DIVERSITY MODELING VIA SKIP-CONNECTION SUFFERS FROM SHORTCUT
utt_0021 utt 128.89 136.09 -X LEARNING AND RECONSTRUCT ANOMALIES SUCCESSFULLY WHICH WEAKENS THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY ANOMALIES.
utt_0022 utt 137.69 140.76 -X HERE, WE INTRODUCE THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE:
utt_0023 utt 140.82 146.30 -X TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RECONSTRUCTING DIVERSE NORMALS AND DETECTING UNKNOWN ANOMALIES
utt_0024 utt 148.47 158.23 -X TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, WE MODEL THE PRINCIPAL DIVERSITY PATTERN THAT POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE SEVERITY OF ANOMALIES. WITH SUCH A MODELING,
utt_0026 utt 158.23 163.23 -X THE DIVERSE NORMALS WILL CAUSE SLIGHT RECONSTRUCTION ERROR AND LOW UNCERTAINTY,
utt_0027 utt 164.18 169.56 -X WHILE ANOMALIES HAVING RELATIVELY LARGE SCORE OF MEASUREMENT TO THE DIVERSITY.
utt_0028 utt 170.52 182.08 -X BESIDES, ABNORMAL INFORMATION FROM CONTAMINATED DATA IS ALSO TEND TO BE MODELING WITH THE DIVERSITY BRANCH, WHOSE MEASUREMENT IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH ANOMALIES!
utt_0030 utt 183.96 195.68 -X THE CORRESPONDING OPTIMIZATION OF DIVERSITY MODELING HAS THREE OBJECTIVES ACCORDING TO THE FORMULATION: FIRSTLY, ùüÅ CAN MODEL DIVERSITY FROM PROTOTYPES TO ANY NORMAL INPUTS,
utt_0032 utt 195.70 203.26 -X THUS DO NOT YIELD HIGH SCORE SECONDLY, THE DIVERSITY GENERATED BY ùüÅ IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED
utt_0033 utt 203.39 211.42 -X TO THE MEASURE FINALLY, AS A SUPPLEMENT, ùüÅ SHOULD INCLUDES MINIMUM PROTOTYPICAL INFORMATION.
utt_0034 utt 213.40 224.99 -X WE FURTHER APPLY THE FRAMEWORK WITH GEOMETRICAL DIVERSITY, WHICH BASED ON AN ASSUME THAT ANOMALIES CAN BE REPRESENTED AS SIGNIFICANT DEFORMATION OF APPEARANCES,
utt_0036 utt 225.18 233.28 -X INCLUDING POSITIONAL CHANGES AND FINE MOTIONS. IN CONTRAST, DIVERSE NORMAL SAMPLES CAN BE
utt_0037 utt 233.28 241.89 -X REPRESENTED AS WEAKER DEFORMATIONS THUS EASILY DISTINGUISHED. THE MODEL INCLUDES TWO BRANCHES FOR
utt_0038 utt 241.89 254.69 -X GEOMETRICAL DIVERSITY AND PROTOTYPICAL CONTENT. WITH THIS ARCHITECTURE, WE ESSENTIALLY DECOUPLES THE DEFORMATION FROM CLASS PROTOTYPES AND MAKES THE FINAL ANOMALY SCORE MORE DISCRIMINATIVE.
utt_0040 utt 257.40 264.91 -X INSPIRED BY DEFORMABLE CONVOLUTION, WE ESTIMATE DEFORMATION FIELDS WITH K COARSE-TO-FINE SCALES TO
utt_0041 utt 264.91 273.09 -X MODEL THE MOTION, BEHAVIOR AND DEFECT OF DIFFERENT ANOMALY TYPES FROM REFERENCE TO ORIGINAL INPUT.
utt_0042 utt 273.53 278.63 -X TO AVOID SHORTCUT LEARNING BY MINIMIZING THE UNCONSTRAINED RECONSTRUCTION LOSS,
utt_0043 utt 278.88 285.70 -X WE ADDITIONALLY COMPUTE SMOOTHNESS LOSS VIA GRADIENT OPERATION AND STRENGTH LOSS.
utt_0044 utt 286.14 294.95 -X THE INFORMATION COMPRESSING MODULE USES VQ-LAYER WITH SINGLE MEMORY RATHER THAN THE LINEAR COMBINATION TO EXCLUDE ABNORMAL PATTERNS.
utt_0046 utt 295.65 302.47 -X FINALLY THE BINARY MASK IS INTRODUCED TO SEPARATE BACKGROUND INFORMATION FROM PROTOTYPICAL MEMORY
utt_0047 utt 304.70 314.55 -X FOR FEATURE SPACE RECONSTRUCTION, WE ADDITIONALLY ESTIMATE THE REVERSE DEFORMATION PROCESS. THIS ALLOWS FOR APPLYING CYCLE-CONSISTENCY CONSTRAINT
utt_0049 utt 314.62 320.52 -X TO ALLEVIATE OVER-COMPRESSION AND ADDRESS SHORTCUT LEARNING. FINALLY,
utt_0050 utt 320.52 326.76 -X WE ADJUST THE DEFORMED ANOMALY MAP BACK TO THE ORIGINAL POSITION FOR THE LOCALIZATION TASK.
utt_0051 utt 329.57 334.69 -X HERE WE HAVE TWO TOY EXPERIMENTS ON MNIST TO ILLUSTRATE OUR WORK QUALITATIVELY.
utt_0052 utt 335.49 347.59 -X THE COURSE-TO FINE DEFORMATION FIELDS ARE SHOWN AS TRANS-C AND TRANS-F ON THE LEFT AND MIDDLE LINES ON THE RIGHT. THE MEASUREMENT TO THE GEOMETRICAL DIVERSITY IS SHOWN AS '' A_DF''.
utt_0054 utt 348.51 352.26 -X AND THE FINAL ANOMALY MAP IS MARKED AS ''SCORE''.
utt_0055 utt 356.04 363.43 -X AND OUR APPROACH OUTPERFORMS PREVIOUS WORKS ON BOTH VIDEO ANOMALY DETECTION AND INDUSTRIAL DEFECT DETECTION
utt_0057 utt 363.43 372.94 -X THE VISUALIZATION RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIVERSE NORMAL AND ANOMALIES.
utt_0058 utt 376.52 381.58 -X AND WE SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BINARY MASK IN SHANGHAITECH DATASET AS WELL.
utt_0059 utt 386.73 391.59 -X UNLIKE PDM, PPDM IS PARTIALLY IN CHARGE OF THE INFORMATION COMPRESSION.
utt_0060 utt 391.59 397.83 -X THAT IS PPDM REMOVES THE DIVERSE APPEARANCE BY USING THE REVERSE DEFORMATION PROCESS.
utt_0061 utt 401.80 413.42 -X IN CONCLUSION, DIVERSITY-MEASURABLE ANOMALY DETECTION FRAMEWORK MODELS RESTRICTED DIVERSITY AND ACHIEVES BETTER TRADE-OFF BETWEEN RECONSTRUCTING DIVERSE NORMALS AND DETECTING
utt_0063 utt 413.42 427.88 -X UNKNOWN ANOMALIES. AS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF DMAD, PYRAMID DEFORMATION MODULE PERFORMS DIVERSITY MEASURE THAT POSITIVELY CORRELATING TO ABNORMALITY. THE RESULT ON BOTH VIDEO ANOMALY
utt_0065 utt 427.88 434.44 -2.9940 DETECTION AND INDUSTRIAL DEFECT DETECTION SHOW THE EFFECTIVENESS AND APPLICABILITY OF OUR WORK.
