utt_0000 utt 0.46 11.18 -X HI, I AM ZIQI HUANG. I WILL PRESENT OUR WORK “A DIAGNOSTIC STUDY OF VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING WITH ANALOGICAL REASONING”. THIS IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN
utt_0002 utt 11.18 24.72 -X NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY AND A*STAR. ANALOGICAL REASONING IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF COGNITION AND INTELLIGENCE. HUMANS ARE USUALLY ABLE TO DISCOVER THE RELATIONS
utt_0004 utt 24.72 31.44 -X BETWEEN ANALOGICALLY RELATED CONCEPTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO SAY THAT
utt_0005 utt 31.47 43.70 -X “A KING IS TO A QUEEN AS AN EMPEROR IS TO AN EMPRESS”, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A KING AND A QUEEN IS SIMILAR TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN EMPEROR AND AN EMPRESS.
utt_0007 utt 45.39 51.89 -X ANOTHER EXAMPLE, A BROWN DOG TO A WHITE DOG, WHERE THE COLOUR CHANGES FROM BROWN TO WHITE,
utt_0008 utt 51.92 56.05 -X IS ANALOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TO A BROWN CAT TO A WHITE CAT.
utt_0009 utt 57.04 65.59 -X LIKE WHAT IS SHOWN HERE, WE CAN USE GEOMETRIC OBJECTS TO REPRESENT THE CONCEPT OF ANALOGY IN A CONTROLLABLE WAY.
utt_0011 utt 66.73 72.85 -X THE SETTING COULD BE MORE COMPLEX, LIKE HERE, FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND IMAGE,
utt_0012 utt 72.85 86.68 -X ALL THE OBJECTS CHANGE FROM LARGE TO SMALL, WHILE OTHER ATTRIBUTES LIKE THEIR COLOURS, SHAPES AND LOCATIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED. FROM THE THIRD TO THE FOURTH IMAGE, THE SAME TRANSFORMATION APPLIES.
utt_0014 utt 87.34 100.69 -X WE WOULD LIKE TO TEST WHETHER ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS ARE ABLE TO DISCOVER THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND IMAGE, AND ANALOGICALLY REASON ON THE CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE.
utt_0016 utt 100.69 106.07 -X SO WE REMOVE SOME OR ALL OF THE CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE,
utt_0017 utt 106.07 110.93 -X AND ASK QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE.
utt_0018 utt 111.50 117.08 -X NOW THIS BECOMES A VISUAL QUESTION ANSWERING TASK FOR ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS,
utt_0019 utt 117.62 131.03 -X AND SINCE TRADITIONAL VQA ONLY INVOLVES ONE IMAGE, WHILE OUR TASK INVOLVES A GROUP OF ANALOGICALLY RELATED IMAGES, WE TERM THIS TASK AS ANALOGICAL VQA.
utt_0021 utt 131.76 138.29 -X IN THIS ANALOGICAL VQA PROBLEM. THE SOLVER IS GIVEN FOUR ANALOGICALLY RELATED IMAGES,
utt_0022 utt 138.51 142.71 -X WHERE THE CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE IS INTENTIONALLY REMOVED.
utt_0023 utt 143.03 149.05 -X WE ASK THE SOLVER A NATURAL LANGUAGE QUESTION ON THE ORIGINAL CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE:
utt_0024 utt 149.05 151.77 -X “ARE THE MISSING OBJECTS ALL TINY OBJECTS?”.
utt_0025 utt 152.31 157.85 -X THE SOLVER IS SUPPOSED TO FIRST DISCOVER THE TRANSFORMATION FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND IMAGE,
utt_0026 utt 157.85 164.28 -X AND THEN APPLY THIS TRANSFORMATION ON THE THIRD IMAGE TO IMAGINE THE CONTENT OF THE FINAL IMAGE.
utt_0028 utt 164.75 168.98 -X WITH THAT IN MIND, THE SOLVER ANSWERS THE QUESTION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE.
utt_0029 utt 169.43 175.06 -X TO STUDY ANALOGICAL VQA IN DEPTH AND PERFORM OBJECTIVE EVALUATION,
utt_0030 utt 175.06 181.02 -X WE BUILD THE CLEVR-ANALOGY DATASET. FOR EACH ANALOGICAL VQA PROBLEM,
utt_0031 utt 181.02 185.11 -X WE PROVIDE THE IMAGES, THE QUESTION AND THE GROUND-TRUTH ANSWER,
utt_0032 utt 186.04 190.55 -X AND ALSO THE GROUND-TRUTH CONTENT OF THE INCOMPLETE IMAGE.
utt_0033 utt 191.22 197.11 -X FOR THE five IMAGES, WE PROVIDE SCENE-GRAPH-LIKE ANNOTATIONS FOR EACH OBJECT.
utt_0034 utt 197.75 203.35 -X WE ALSO PROVIDE FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMS THAT LOGICALLY COMPRISES THE QUESTION.
utt_0035 utt 203.38 209.43 -X THERE ARE FOUR SEVEN NINE THOUSAND AND NINE HUNDRED ANALOGICAL VQA PROBLEMS IN OUR DATASET.
utt_0037 utt 214.55 222.97 -X ON TOP OF WHICH WE DEFINE A SET OF ANALOGY RULES THAT DESCRIBE THE ANALOGICAL RELATIONS BETWEEN A PAIR OF TWO IMAGES.
utt_0039 utt 223.70 232.60 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HERE OBJECT SIZE CHANGING FROM LARGE TO SMALL BELONGS TO ONE TYPE OF ANALOGY RULE.
utt_0040 utt 232.60 238.52 -X THE NATURAL LANGUAGE QUESTION IS CONDITIONED ON THE ANALOGY RULE,
utt_0041 utt 238.61 251.23 -X THE QUESTION TENDS TO SPECIFICALLY EXAMINE WHETHER THE SOLVER HAS UNDERSTOOD THE ANALOGY RULE. FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS PROBLEM THE ANALOGY RULE IS RELATED TO SIZE CHANGE,
utt_0043 utt 251.23 254.49 -X SO THE QUESTION ASKED IS ALSO ABOUT OBJECT SIZE.
utt_0044 utt 256.31 263.04 -X WE DEFINE A TOTAL OF nine ANALOGY RULES, WHICH FALL INTO four BROAD CATEGORIES.
utt_0045 utt 263.93 271.13 -X FOR EXAMPLE, OBJECT SIZE CHANGING FROM LARGE TO SMALL BELONGS TO THE ANALOGY RULE ON THE TOP LEFT,
utt_0046 utt 271.16 276.16 -X WHERE ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF ALL OBJECTS CHANGES FROM A TO B.
utt_0047 utt 277.91 289.71 -X WE EVALUATE HOW RECENT POPULAR VQA BASELINES PERFORM ON ANALOGICAL VQA PROBLEMS. THIS IS THE AVERAGE RESULT ON ALL THE ANALOGY RULES. WE CAN
utt_0049 utt 289.71 294.81 -X SEE A NOTABLE GAP BETWEEN THE BEST PERFORMING MODEL AND HUMAN SOLVERS.
utt_0051 utt 302.78 305.05 -X ONE POSSIBLE REASON IS THAT,
utt_0052 utt 305.53 314.14 -X FOR SYMMETRY, OBJECTS IN A PAIR OF IMAGES ARE AT COMPLETELY MIRRORED POSITIONS WITH HUGE SPATIAL STRUCTURE CHANGE,
utt_0054 utt 314.14 319.39 -X WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR MODELS TO REASON AND IMAGINE THE INCOMPLETE IMAGE.
utt_0055 utt 320.67 327.97 -X FOR THE CATEGORY ATTRIBUTE AND ONE OBJECT, MODEL PERFORMANCE IS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SYMMETRY,
utt_0056 utt 327.97 332.51 -2.1737 POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE PAIRED IMAGES SHARE MORE SPATIAL SIMILARITY.
