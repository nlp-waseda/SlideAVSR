utt_0000 utt 0.03 6.26 -X HI, I'M YUNLONG WANG, A RESEARCH FELLOW FROM NUS UBICOMP LAB LED BY PROF. BRIAN LIM.
utt_0001 utt 6.54 10.74 -X ON BEHALF OF MY CO-AUTHORS, I'M GOING TO PRESENT OUR PAPER,
utt_0002 utt 10.74 18.03 -X DIRECTED DIVERSITY: LEVERAGING LANGUAGE EMBEDDING DISTANCES FOR COLLECTIVE CREATIVITY IN CLOUD IDEATION.
utt_0003 utt 19.05 30.61 -X CROWDSOURCING CAN EASILY COLLECT MANY IDEAS FROM MANY PEOPLE, FOR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CREATIVE STORY WRITING, GRAPHIC DESIGN, AND IDEATING MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES.
utt_0005 utt 30.61 35.67 -X THE GOAL IS FOR EACH IDEATOR TO CONCEIVE ONE OR MORE CREATIVE IDEAS.
utt_0006 utt 36.08 43.51 -X HOWEVER, WITH MANY IDEATORS, SEVERAL OF THEM ARE BOUND TO CONCEIVE IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR IDEAS.
utt_0007 utt 43.51 47.48 -X THIS LEADS TO THE PROBLEM OF REDUNDANCY IN CROWD IDEATION.
utt_0008 utt 47.66 54.20 -X WE OBTAIN FEWER UNIQUE IDEAS THAN THE NUMBER OF IDEATION TASKS REQUESTED FROM THE CROWD.
utt_0009 utt 54.20 58.45 -X HOW CAN WE REDUCE THIS REDUNDANCY AND FOSTER DIVERSITY?
utt_0010 utt 58.83 61.53 -X LET'S SEE WITH A CONCRETE USE CASE.
utt_0013 utt 71.22 75.86 -X WE EMPLOY CROWD IDEATION TO OBTAIN THESE MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES.
utt_0014 utt 75.86 81.88 -X THIS IS DONE BY PRESENTING OR PROMPTING EACH CROWD WORKER WITH PHRASES TO STIMULATE HIS CREATIVITY.
utt_0015 utt 82.32 87.23 -X THE WORKER THEN USES THE PHRASES TO COMPOSE HIS MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGE.
utt_0016 utt 87.64 93.34 -X THE KEY TO OBTAINING DIVERSE MESSAGES IS TO SELECT DIVERSE PROMPTS FOR WORKERS.
utt_0017 utt 93.40 98.65 -X THAT IS, PROVIDE DIFFERENT WORKERS WITH DIFFERENT PROMPTS.
utt_0018 utt 98.65 106.30 -X IN OUR WORK, WE PROPOSE AN AUTOMATIC DIVERSE PROMPT SELECTION METHOD TO DO THIS: DIRECTED DIVERSITY.
utt_0019 utt 106.94 110.20 -X DIRECTED DIVERSITY INVOLVES THREE STEPS.
utt_0020 utt 110.42 119.10 -X FIRST, WE EXTRACT PHRASES FOR PROMPTING FROM A CORPUS OF DOCUMENTS, SUCH AS ONLINE ARTICLES AND DISCUSSION FORUMS.
utt_0021 utt 119.10 128.32 -X SECOND, WE OBTAIN A VECTOR REPRESENTATION OR EMBEDDING OF EACH PHRASE BY APPLYING THE UNIVERSAL SENTENCE ENCODER, A DEEP LEARNING LANGUAGE MODEL.
utt_0022 utt 128.32 135.01 -X THIS ALLOWS US TO CALCULATE DIVERSITY METRICS AND SELECT PHRASES BASED ON THEIR VECTOR DISTANCES.
utt_0023 utt 135.01 141.79 -X THIRD, WE SELECT THE DIVERSE SUBSET OF PHRASES USING OUR PROPOSED SELECTION MECHANISM DESCRIBED NEXT.
utt_0024 utt 143.03 150.56 -X THE PHRASE SELECTION MECHANISM CAN HELP DIRECT THE SELECTION OF PHRASES TOWARDS DESIRED LOCATIONS IN THE LANGUAGE VECTOR SPACE.
utt_0025 utt 151.23 156.70 -X PHRASE SELECTION IS A DIVERSITY MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM. IT INVOLVES FOUR STEPS.
utt_0026 utt 157.31 160.19 -X HAVING MAPPED EACH PHRASE TO AN EMBEDDING VECTOR,
utt_0027 utt 160.19 166.18 -X WE BUILD A MINIMUM SPANNING TREE USING AGGLOMERATIVE HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING WITH SINGLE-LINKAGE.
utt_0028 utt 167.01 172.87 -X WITH THE NUMBER OF PROMPTS SPECIFIED, THE DEPTH TO TRANSVERSE DOWN THE TREE DENDROGRAM IS SET.
utt_0029 utt 173.28 176.90 -X THIS ALSO SETS THE CLUSTERS BASED ON BRANCHES IN THE TREE.
utt_0030 utt 177.25 182.53 -X FOR EACH CLUSTER, WE SELECT THE POINT WITH LARGEST MINIMUM PAIRWISE DISTANCE.
utt_0031 utt 183.49 186.40 -X THESE POINTS ARE THE MOST DIVERSE PROMPTS.
utt_0032 utt 186.94 193.25 -X THIS METHOD FOR DIRECTED DIVERSITY PROMPT SELECTION IS THE FIRST CONTRIBUTION OF OUR WORK.
utt_0033 utt 194.62 202.34 -X TO EVALUATE IF AND HOW WELL DIRECTED DIVERSITY WORKS, WE CONDUCTED SEVERAL SIMULATION AND USER STUDIES.
utt_0034 utt 204.77 207.62 -X WE WERE INTERESTED IN THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS.
utt_0035 utt 207.87 213.06 -X HOW DOES PROMPT SELECTION AFFECT THE COMPUTED DIVERSITY OF PROMPTS AND IDEAS?
utt_0036 utt 213.25 217.77 -X HOW DOES PROMPT DIVERSITY AFFECT IDEATION EFFORT FOR IDEATORS?
utt_0037 utt 218.02 223.82 -X HOW DOES PROMPT SELECTION AFFECT PERCEIVED AND THEMATIC DIVERSITY OF IDEATIONS?
utt_0038 utt 224.10 231.18 -X FOR ALL RESEARCH QUESTIONS, WE COMPARED PROMPT SELECTION TECHNIQUES AS THE MAIN INDEPENDENT VARIABLE:
utt_0039 utt 231.18 236.52 -X NONE, RANDOMLY SELECTED PROMPTS, AND DIRECTED DIVERSITY SELECTED PROMPTS.
utt_0040 utt 236.74 242.25 -X TO ANSWER DIFFERENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS, WE IDENTIFIED VARIOUS METRICS AND METHODS.
utt_0041 utt 242.69 249.61 -X WE FORMALIZED THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND METRICS WITH THE DIVERSITY PROMPTING EVALUATION FRAMEWORK.
utt_0042 utt 250.95 256.30 -X THIS FRAMEWORK IS ANCHORED BY AN IDEATION CHAIN WHICH WE DEFINE WITH FOUR STEPS:
utt_0043 utt 256.52 261.16 -X THE PROMPT SELECTION TECHNIQUE WILL INFLUENCE THE CREATIVITY OF SELECTED PROMPTS,
utt_0044 utt 261.16 266.16 -X THE IDEATION PROCESS OF IDEATORS, AND THE CREATIVITY OF THEIR IDEATION.
utt_0045 utt 266.76 271.08 -X OUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS TEST BETWEEN EACH STEP IN THE IDEATION CHAIN.
utt_0046 utt 271.66 282.93 -X ON MANIPULATING THE PROMPT INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, WE MEASURE VARIOUS EXPERIMENT CONSTRUCTS TO CHECK HOW WELL IDEATORS ARE PROMPTED TO GENERATE CREATIVE IDEAS, NAMELY,
utt_0048 utt 282.95 286.80 -X COMPUTED EMBEDDING-BASED DISTANCE AND DIVERSITY METRICS,
utt_0049 utt 286.95 290.41 -X RATINGS FROM IDEATORS ABOUT THEIR IDEATION EFFORT,
utt_0050 utt 290.63 294.96 -X RATINGS FROM VALIDATORS ABOUT IDEATION DIVERSITY AND QUALITY,
utt_0051 utt 294.99 298.03 -X AND DIVERSITY MEASURES FROM THEMATIC ANALYSIS.
utt_0052 utt 298.47 302.80 -X WE APPLIED THIS FRAMEWORK IN SEVERAL SIMULATION AND USER STUDIES.
utt_0053 utt 302.80 308.30 -X OUR USER STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED ON AMAZON MECHANICAL TURK WITH five hundred and forty PARTICIPANTS IN TOTAL.
utt_0054 utt 310.70 319.34 -X SO, BACK TO OUR RESEARCH QUESTION. DOES DIRECTED DIVERSITY IMPROVE DIVERSITY FOR IDEATING MOTIVATIONAL MESSAGES?
utt_0055 utt 319.34 327.31 -X YES. DIRECTED DIVERSITY INCREASED THE MINIMUM PAIRWISE DISTANCE BETWEEN IDEATIONS COMPARED TO RANDOM AND NONE PROMPTS.
utt_0056 utt 327.41 329.68 -X THEY ARE ALSO MOST EVENLY SPACED.
utt_0057 utt 330.29 334.99 -X IDEATORS RATED ITS PROMPTS AS MORE UNEXPECTED.
utt_0058 utt 334.99 340.02 -X VALIDATORS RATED ITS IDEATIONS AS MORE UNREPETITIVE AND MORE DIFFERENT.
utt_0059 utt 340.59 345.78 -4.4290 AND A THEMATIC ANALYSIS FOUND MORE ORIGINAL IDEAS FROM DIRECTED DIVERSITY.
