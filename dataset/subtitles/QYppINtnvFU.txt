utt_0001 utt 1.29 13.04 -X MY NAME IS CARLO FURIA AND THIS IS A SHORT SUMMARY OF THE TSE PAPER BAYESIAN DATA ANALYSIS IN EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING RESEARCH WRITTEN WITH MY COLLEAGUES ROBERT FELDT AND RICHARD TORKAR.​
utt_0004 utt 13.04 17.52 -X THIS WORK IS REALLY ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
utt_0005 utt 17.81 23.70 -X IN PARTICULAR, IT IS COMMON TO COMPARE FREQUENTIST STATISTICS TO BAYESIAN STATISTICS.
utt_0006 utt 23.76 30.55 -X FREQUENTIST STATISTICS INCLUDE WIDELY USED TECHNIQUES SUCH AS NULL-HYPOTHESIS STATISTICAL TESTING AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS.
utt_0008 utt 30.67 38.07 -X BAYESIAN STATISTICS, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS ULTIMATELY BUILT ON SO-CALLED BAYES THEOREM OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES​.
utt_0010 utt 38.22 47.80 -X BESIDES PROVIDING TWO ALTERNATIVE SETS OF TECHNIQUES, FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN STATISTICS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE KIND OF ANALYSIS AND PROCEDURES THEY SUPPORT.
utt_0012 utt 48.27 57.01 -X AS ILLUSTRATED VERY WELL BY THIS XKCD COMIC, FREQUENTIST STATISTICS IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH RIGID PROCEDURES AND MATHEMATICAL RIGOR.
utt_0014 utt 57.30 66.74 -X BAYESIAN STATISTICS, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS A MORE PRAGMATIC APPROACH, WHICH CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN HOW PRACTICALLY USEFUL A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS CAN BE IN THE END.​
utt_0016 utt 68.75 74.61 -X IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASING CRITICISM OF FREQUENTIST STATISTICS (AND,
utt_0017 utt 74.61 81.56 -X IN PARTICULAR, OF PRACTICES SUCH AS NULL HYPOTHESIS STATISTICAL TESTING), AND THIS CRITICISM CULMINATED,
utt_0018 utt 81.94 89.96 -X IN RECENT YEARS, IN SOME CALLS MADE BY VERY PROMINENT STATISTICIANS, TO STOP USING ALTOGETHER
utt_0019 utt 92.02 95.10 -X NHST AS A BASIS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
utt_0020 utt 95.10 100.25 -X SO, FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN DOING EMPIRICAL DATA ANALYSIS IN THE CONTEXT OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING,
utt_0021 utt 100.25 114.78 -X IT SEEMS A VERY GOOD TIME TO LEARN ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED ABOUT FREQUENTIST STATISTICS, AND ALSO TO LEARN WHAT KINDS OF ADVANTAGES SWITCHING TO BAYESIAN STATISTICS AS AN ALTERNATIVE MAY BRING.
utt_0024 utt 114.84 118.23 -X AND THIS IS WHAT THIS TALK IS REALLY PRIMARILY ABOUT.​
utt_0025 utt 119.89 130.78 -X AMONG ALL FREQUENTIST TECHNIQUES WE FOCUS ON NULL HYPOTHESIS STATISTICAL TESTING ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S WIDELY USED AND SUFFERS FROM A NUMBER OF WELL-KNOWN ISSUES.
utt_0027 utt 131.35 138.43 -X TO DEMONSTRATE THESE ISSUES, IN THE PAPER WE GO THROUGH SOME DATA COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.
utt_0029 utt 138.43 146.20 -X THIS DATA WAS ORIGINALLY ANALYZED IN A RELATED PUBLICATION USING TECHNIQUES FROM NHST.
utt_0030 utt 147.42 162.11 -X SO, IN THIS CONTEXT, USING THIS KIND OF FREQUENTIST TECHNIQUES, IF WE WANT TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF TWO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, FOR EXAMPLE SAY THAT WE WANT TO COMPARE C TO PYTHON, WE WOULD FORMULATE A NULL HYPOTHESIS.​
utt_0033 utt 162.11 172.03 -X THE NULL HYPOTHESIS ESSENTIALLY ENCODES THE SCENARIO WHERE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE, OR NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BETWEEN C AND PYTHON PERFORMANCE.​
utt_0035 utt 175.39 180.06 -X THEN, NHST PROCEEDS BY COMPUTING A STATISTICS, CALLED THE P-VALUE, FROM THE DATA.
utt_0036 utt 180.48 194.69 -X THE P-VALUE IS A PROBABILITY AND IF IT'S SMALL (TYPICALLY BELOW five% OR EVEN SMALLER) THEN WE CONCLUDE THAT THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS UNLIKELY TO HOLD, SO WE REJECT IT OTHERWISE WE DON'T REJECT IT.​
utt_0039 utt 195.58 204.74 -X TO BE A BIT MORE PRECISE, THE P-VALUE IS A CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY: IT'S THE PROBABILITY THAT THE OBSERVED DATA WOULD OCCUR IF THE NULL HYPOTHESIS WERE TRUE.
utt_0041 utt 204.74 210.63 -X SO, IF P IS VERY SMALL, IT MEANS THAT THE DATA IS UNLIKELY TO OCCUR UNDER THE NULL HYPOTHESIS.
utt_0043 utt 211.45 223.78 -X ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEM[S] WITH THIS APPROACH IS THAT P-VALUES ARE PERFECTLY WELL-DEFINED MATHEMATICALLY, BUT THEY DO NOT REALLY CAPTURE WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW OF AN EXPERIMENT.
utt_0045 utt 223.84 228.13 -X ​ THE P-VALUE IS THE PROBABILITY OF THE DATA ASSUMING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS.
utt_0047 utt 228.13 233.92 -X BUT WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW IS THE CONVERSE PROBABILITY: THE PROBABILITY OF THE NULL HYPOTHESIS GIVEN THE DATA.
utt_0049 utt 233.92 240.26 -X AND, IN GENERAL, WE CANNOT GET ONE PROBABILITY FROM THE OTHER WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
utt_0050 utt 241.54 253.13 -X BAYESIAN STATISTICS IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THIS APPROACH BUT IT'S NOT JUST A PATCH OF FREQUENTIST TECHNIQUES, IT'S A WHOLE NEW LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT.​
utt_0052 utt 253.41 259.24 -X BAYESIAN ANALYSIS EMPHASIZES MODELING OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND OF THE RELATIONS BETWEEN DATA.​
utt_0053 utt 259.46 273.70 -X THE INTERPRETATION OF A BAYESIAN MODEL TYPICALLY CORRESPONDS MORE CLOSELY TO THE INTUITIVE NOTION OF PROBABILITY THAT WE HAVE.​ AND BAYESIAN MODELS ALSO NATURALLY INCORPORATE DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND ASSUMPTIONS IN A QUANTITATIVE, TRANSPARENT WAY.​
utt_0056 utt 276.07 281.29 -X THIS SLIDE SHOWS, IN A NUTSHELL, THE BASIC INGREDIENTS OF A BAYESIAN ANALYSIS.
utt_0057 utt 282.63 289.16 -X MODELS ARE ULTIMATELY BASED ON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOME QUANTITIES OF INTEREST IN THE DOMAIN OF ANALYSIS.
utt_0059 utt 289.64 300.97 -X GOING BACK TO OUR RUNNING EXAMPLE, IF WE WANT TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF C AND PYTHON PROGRAMS WE COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, BUILD A PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF SPEEDUPS OF ONE LANGUAGE OVER THE OTHER.
utt_0062 utt 301.19 307.47 -X THEN THE INPUT TO A BAYESIAN ANALYSIS INCLUDES THE DATA, OF COURSE, BUT ALSO A PRIOR DISTRIBUTION,
utt_0063 utt 307.75 313.74 -X WHICH IS A FORMALIZATION OF OUR DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS.
utt_0064 utt 313.83 324.27 -X THEN THE OUTPUT OF THIS ANALYSIS WOULD ALSO BE A FULL DISTRIBUTION (INSTEAD OF JUST A SCALAR STATISTICS LIKE THE P-VALUE), WHICH WE CAN ANALYZE IN DETAIL TO ANSWER ALL SORTS
utt_0066 utt 325.16 330.57 -X OF QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE ABOUT OUR DATA IN A QUANTITATIVE AND PRINCIPLED WAY.​
utt_0067 utt 331.72 337.15 -X NATURALLY, THIS WAS JUST A SHORT TEASER OF THE MAIN MESSAGE IN THE PAPER: BAYESIAN STATISTICS
utt_0068 utt 337.32 342.09 -X ARE A NATURAL AND POWERFUL ALTERNATIVE TO FREQUENTIST TECHNIQUES, WHICH CAN HELP YOUR
utt_0069 utt 342.67 347.76 -X STATISTICAL ANALYSIS BECOME NOT JUST FORMALLY CORRECT BUT ALSO MORE PRACTICALLY USEFUL.
utt_0070 utt 347.76 355.44 -X IF ANY OF THIS IS INTERESTING TO YOU, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE TSE PAPER (AS WELL AS OTHER PAPERS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON) FOR MANY MORE DETAILS.​
