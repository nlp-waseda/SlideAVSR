utt_0000 utt 0.19 14.45 -X HELLO, I’M JONATHAN LORRAINE AND I’M PRESENTING OUR PAPER “USING BIFURCATIONS FOR DIVERSITY IN DIFFERENTIABLE GAMES,” WITH MY COLLABORATORS JACK PARKER-HOLDER, PAUL VICOL,
utt_0002 utt 14.45 18.87 -X ALDO PACCHIANO, LUKE METZ, TAL KACHMAN, AND JAKOB FOERSTER.
utt_0003 utt 20.62 24.95 -X FINDING DIFFERENT TYPES OF SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN USEFUL IN SINGLE OBJECTIVE MINIMIZATION.
utt_0004 utt 24.95 30.90 -X FOR EXAMPLE, FINDING SOLUTIONS THAT USE SHAPES VERSUS TEXTURE IN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS.
utt_0006 utt 31.85 35.06 -X DIFFERENTIABLE GAMES GENERALIZE SINGLE-OBJECTIVE MINIMIZATION,
utt_0007 utt 35.06 38.23 -X WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE PLAYERS, EACH TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR OWN LOSS.
utt_0008 utt 38.58 46.42 -X SOLUTION CONCEPTS FOR GAMES OFTEN INVOLVE FINDING POINTS WHERE NO PLAYER CAN GAIN FROM CHANGING THEIR STRATEGY UNILATERALLY. FOR EXAMPLE, A NASH EQUILIBRIUM.
utt_0010 utt 47.79 51.38 -X FINDING SOLUTIONS IN GAMES HAS BEEN OF INCREASING INTEREST IN MACHINE LEARNING.
utt_0011 utt 51.38 57.04 -X FOR EXAMPLE, GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS, HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMIZATION, SELF-PLAY,
utt_0012 utt 57.04 62.16 -X META-LEARNING, ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES, CURRICULUM LEARNING, ARCHITECTURE SEARCH, AND MANY OTHERS.
utt_0013 utt 63.63 67.38 -X OUR GOAL WITH THIS WORK WAS TO BE ABLE TO FIND DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN DIFFERENTIABLE GAMES.
utt_0014 utt 67.67 78.17 -X FOR EXAMPLE, HAVING PLAYERS EITHER BATTLE OR COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER MIGHT BOTH BE SOLUTIONS, BUT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND BOTH OF THESE TO CHOOSE FROM.
utt_0016 utt 78.71 89.94 -X RIDGE RIDER IS A GENERAL METHOD FOR FINDING DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN SINGLE-OBJECTIVE MINIMIZATION BY STARTING AT SADDLE POINTS AND BRANCHING THE OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE IN THE DIRECTION OF NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES.
utt_0019 utt 89.94 98.58 -X ALSO, BIFURCATIONS ARE AREAS WHERE SMALL CHANGES TO OUR PARAMETERS CAUSE CHANGES TO OUR CONVERGED SOLUTION. SADDLE POINTS ARE A KEY BIFURCATION IN CONSERVATIVE SYSTEMS,
utt_0021 utt 98.58 102.07 -X LIKE THE ONE WE GET FROM FOLLOWING THE GRADIENT.
utt_0022 utt 102.07 105.24 -X HOWEVER, FOLLOWING THE PLAYER’S GRADIENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN GAMES
utt_0023 utt 105.27 110.49 -X IS A NON-CONSERVATIVE SYSTEM, SO WE HAVE MORE TYPES OF BIFURCATIONS AND SOLUTIONS.
utt_0024 utt 111.99 121.63 -X THIS IS BECAUSE THE HESSIAN’S GENERALIZATION FOR GAMES -- THE GAME HESSIAN -- MAY BE NON-SYMMETRIC AND COULD HAVE COMPLEX EIGENVALUES. THE GAME HESSIAN IS SHOWN HERE AT THE BOTTOM,
utt_0026 utt 121.63 135.05 -X WHERE L_A IS PLAYER A’S LOSS IN RED AND L_B IS PLAYER B’S LOSS IN BLUE. THIS IS JUST A HESSIAN IF L_A EQUALS L_B -- I.E., THE SINGLE-OBJECTIVE CASE. BUT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN MINIMAX GAMES WE
utt_0028 utt 135.41 144.22 -X HAVE L_A EQUALS -L_B AND THIS MATRIX COULD BE SKEW-SYMMETRIC WITH PURELY IMAGINARY EIGENVALUES.
utt_0029 utt 144.25 153.50 -X SO, TO GENERALIZE RIDGE RIDER TO GAMES WITH MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES, WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE NON-CONSERVATIVE SYSTEM FROM FOLLOWING THE GRADIENTS.
utt_0031 utt 153.50 167.52 -X THE GAME HESSIAN CAN HAVE COMPLEX EIGENVALUES, AND IT IS COMMON TO WRITE THE ASSOCIATED EIGENVECTOR WITH COMPLEX ENTRIES. HOWEVER, NAIVELY FOLLOWING A VECTOR WITH COMPLEX ENTRIES MIGHT GIVE US COMPLEX-VALUED WEIGHTS, WHICH WE CRUCIALLY WANT TO AVOID. TO SOLVE THIS,
utt_0034 utt 167.52 176.00 -X WHEN AN EIGENVALUE IS COMPLEX WE LOOK AT THE EIGENVECTORS FOR THE CONJUGATE PAIR AND INSTEAD RETURN THE VECTORS SPANNING THE REAL PLANE THAT THE CONJUGATE PAIR TELLS US TO ROTATE IN.
utt_0036 utt 176.31 180.35 -X CONVENIENTLY, THIS IS THE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR FOR PYTORCH’S EIGENVECTOR FUNCTION
utt_0037 utt 182.43 184.93 -X WE ALSO HAVE NEW BIFURCATIONS BESIDES SADDLES.
utt_0038 utt 185.56 193.95 -X WE BRANCH AT POTENTIAL HOPF BIFURCATIONS WHERE THE NEGATIVE REAL PART OF AN EIGENVALUE CROSSES THE IMAGINARY AXIS. THERE MIGHT BE OTHER BIFURCATIONS OF INTEREST TOO.
utt_0040 utt 195.48 199.04 -X FINALLY, WE APPLY AN ARBITRARY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM AFTER BRANCHING.
utt_0041 utt 199.29 209.41 -X FOLLOWING THE GRADIENT IS UNSTABLE FOR SOLUTIONS WITH IMAGINARY EIGENVALUES, SO WE USE A METHOD DESIGNED FOR LEARNING IN GAMES LIKE EXTRAGRADIENT, OPTIMISTIC GRADIENT, LOLA, OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.
utt_0043 utt 212.60 217.89 -X WE ARE INTERESTED IN FIRST FINDING DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN THE ITERATED PRISONER’S DILEMMA,
utt_0044 utt 217.89 231.11 -X WHICH IS A GAME WHERE PLAYERS HAVE VARIOUS SOLUTIONS THAT COOPERATE, LIKE TIT-FOR-TAT OR GRIM TRIGGER, AND VARIOUS SOLUTIONS THAT DON’T COOPERATE RESULTING IN A LOWER REWARD FOR BOTH PLAYERS. TYPICALLY, PARAMETERIZATIONS OF THIS GAME HAVE AT LEAST ten PARAMETERS.
utt_0047 utt 231.11 241.31 -X BUT, THIS WAS DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE, SO WE CONSTRUCTED NEW two-D TOY PROBLEMS AND TO GAIN INTUITION INTO HOW DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS PERFORM FOR FINDING DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN GAMES.
utt_0049 utt 241.41 244.93 -X FIRST, WE CREATED A PROBLEM WE CALL THE SMALL ITERATED PRISONER'S DILEMMA.
utt_0050 utt 244.93 253.60 -X THIS IS LIKE THE ITERATED PRISONER’S DILEMMA, EXCEPT IT ONLY HAS TWO PARAMETERS AND TWO SOLUTIONS. IN THE TOP RIGHT, THE PLAYERS END UP COOPERATING WITH A TIT-FOR-TAT STRATEGY,
utt_0052 utt 253.60 262.34 -X WHILE IN THE BOTTOM LEFT PLAYERS END UP DEFECTING. WE SHOW FOLLOWING THE GRADIENT IN RED, AND LOLA (WHICH IS A METHOD FOR LEARNING IN GAMES) IN BLUE. UNFORTUNATELY,
utt_0054 utt 262.34 270.41 -X THIS SIMPLIFICATION ONLY HAS REAL EIGENVALUES SO IT MAY BE A POOR PROXY FOR MORE GENERAL GAME DYNAMICS WHICH CAN HAVE COMPLEX EIGENVALUES (LIKE THE FULL ITERATED PRISONER'S DILEMMA).
utt_0056 utt 272.07 275.11 -X MATCHING PENNIES IS A two-PARAMETER VERSION OF ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS,
utt_0057 utt 275.11 284.07 -X WHICH HAS IMAGINARY EIGENVALUES AT THE SOLUTION IN THE CENTER WHERE PLAYERS BEHAVE UNIFORMLY RANDOMLY. BECAUSE THE SOLUTION HAS IMAGINARY EIGENVALUES FOLLOWING THE GRADIENT DIVERGES,
utt_0059 utt 284.07 294.22 -X WHILE METHODS FOR LEARNING IN GAMES CONVERGE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS PROBLEM ONLY HAS A SINGLE SOLUTION, SO IT ISN’T A GOOD DOMAIN TO INVESTIGATE FINDING DIVERSE SOLUTIONS.
utt_0061 utt 294.92 303.37 -X TO SOLVE BOTH THESE PROBLEMS, WE INTRODUCE AN OBJECTIVE THAT MIXES THE SMALL ITERATED PRISONER'S DILEMMA AND MATCHING PENNIES. THIS MIXED OBJECTIVE HAS MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS,
utt_0063 utt 303.37 311.30 -X COMPLEX EIGENVALUES, AND A HOPF BIFURCATION SEPARATING TWO KINDS OF SOLUTIONS.
utt_0064 utt 311.30 314.06 -X WE APPLIED OUR METHOD -- GAME RIDGE RIDER -- ON THE TOY PROBLEMS.
utt_0065 utt 314.31 324.36 -X THE SMALL ITERATED PRISONER’S DILEMMA HAS A SADDLE BIFURCATION. EACH BRANCH IS SHOWN WITH A DIFFERENT COLOR, AND WE HAVE AT MOST four BRANCHES HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE two EIGENVECTORS AND FOR EACH
utt_0067 utt 324.36 333.16 -X EIGENVECTOR WE CAN EITHER FOLLOW IT OR NEGATIVE IT. IN PRACTICE, FOR LARGER SCALE PROBLEMS IT SUFFICES TO JUST BRANCH ON THE EIGENVECTORS WITH - SAY - THE LARGEST NEGATIVE REAL PART.
utt_0069 utt 333.16 343.12 -X THE MIXED OBJECTIVE HAS A HOPF BIFURCATION, SO IF WE BRANCH THERE WE CAN FIND BOTH SOLUTIONS. NOTABLY, THE SOLUTION IN THE CENTER HAS IMAGINARY EIGENVALUES,
utt_0071 utt 343.12 345.93 -X SO WE MUST APPLY A METHOD LIKE LOLA AFTER BRANCHING TO FIND IT.
utt_0072 utt 348.90 362.06 -X WE ALSO LOOKED AT FINDING DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN THE FULL ITERATED PRISONER’S DILEMMA. OUR BASELINE STRATEGIES WERE RANDOMLY INITIALIZING, THEN APPLYING A LEARNING ALGORITHM. IF WE USE LOLA FOR OUR OPTIMIZATION, THEN WE FOUND A SOLUTION WHERE PLAYERS COOPERATE LIKE TIT-FOR-TAT EVERY
utt_0075 utt 362.06 366.73 -X TIME. IF WE FOLLOW THE GRADIENT, THEN WE FOUND A SOLUTION WHERE PLAYERS DEFECT EACH TIME.
utt_0076 utt 368.78 378.29 -X IF WE APPLY OUR METHOD, WHICH FIRST FINDS A SADDLE -- SPECIFICALLY THE MAXIMUM ENTROPY SADDLE -- THEN BRANCHES OPTIMIZATION, WE CAN FIND BOTH SOLUTIONS IN A SINGLE RUN. THIS PROBLEM HAS
utt_0078 utt 378.29 383.92 -X ten EIGENVECTORS WE COULD FOLLOW, BUT BRANCHING AT THE TOP FEW WAS SUFFICIENT TO FIND BOTH SOLUTIONS.
utt_0079 utt 383.95 387.21 -X WE ALSO COMPARED WITH BRANCHING OPTIMIZATION AT A RANDOM INITIALIZATION,
utt_0080 utt 387.21 396.34 -X TO SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF BRANCHING AT A BIFURCATION LIKE A SADDLE. THIS FOUND THE SAME SOLUTION ON EVERY BRANCH, SO IT IS KEY TO BRANCH AT A BIFURCATION AND NOT AT AN ARBITRARY POINT.
utt_0082 utt 400.24 403.50 -X SO, WHAT ARE THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THIS TALK? WELL,
utt_0083 utt 403.50 412.88 -X FIRST, DIFFERENTIABLE GAMES GENERALIZE SINGLE OBJECTIVE MINIMIZATION, BUT THEY HAVE NON-CONSERVATIVE DYNAMICS BECAUSE THE GAME HESSIAN CAN BE NON-SYMMETRIC WITH COMPLEX EIGENVALUES.
utt_0085 utt 413.90 422.67 -X ALSO, WE CAN VIEW METHODS WHICH TRY TO FIND DIVERSE SOLUTIONS IN SINGLE-OBJECTIVE MINIMIZATION -- I.E., RIDGE RIDER -- AS FINDING BIFURCATIONS WITH CONSERVATIVE DYNAMICS AND THEN BRANCHING.
utt_0087 utt 425.42 429.01 -X THIS VIEWPOINT ALLOWS US TO DIP INTO THE VAST LITERATURE FOR DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS,
utt_0088 utt 429.01 433.23 -3.9540 AND GENERALIZE RIDGE RIDER TO THE NON-CONSERVATIVE DYNAMICS IN GAMES, WHICH ARE OFTEN MORE
