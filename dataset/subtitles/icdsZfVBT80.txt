utt_0000 utt 0.52 4.14 -X HI MY NAME IS YE, I'M A PHD STUDENT AT CMU
utt_0001 utt 4.40 10.88 -X I WILL TALK ABOUT OUR WORK SIMPOE: SIMULATED CHARACTER CONTROL FOR threeD HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION
utt_0002 utt 11.95 21.83 -X CURRENTLY ALL STATE-OF-THE-ART threeD HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION METHODS ARE KINEMATICS-BASED WHICH MEANS THEY DO NOT MODEL THE PHYSICAL FORCES UNDERLYING THE HUMAN MOTION
utt_0004 utt 22.03 32.15 -X AS A RESULT, THE MOTION THEY PRODUCE CAN BE ACCURATE BUT PHYSICALLY-IMPLAUSIBLE WITH PHYSICAL ARTIFACTS SUCH AS FOOT SLIDING JITTER AND GROUND PENETRATION
utt_0006 utt 32.17 38.45 -X TO ADDRESS THIS, PRIOR WORK HAS USED PHYSICS-BASED TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION FOR HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION
utt_0008 utt 38.80 42.03 -X HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS WITH THESE METHODS
utt_0009 utt 42.09 53.94 -X FIRST, THEY REQUIRE BATCH OPTIMIZATION AT TEST TIME WHICH CAN BE SLOW AND HAVE HIGH LATENCY SECOND, THEY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTACT ESTIMATION MODULES WHICH CAN BE ERROR PRONE
utt_0011 utt 54.25 59.35 -X AND THE OPTIMIZATION IS ALSO NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ADVANCED PHYSICS SIMULATOR
utt_0012 utt 59.54 67.60 -X FINALLY, THERE IS NO LEARNING PROCESS IN THE PHYSICS REASONING PART TO ENSURE THAT THE FINAL OUTPUT IS CLOSE TO THE GROUND TRUTH
utt_0014 utt 70.93 83.17 -X TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES WE PROPOSE SIMPOE A METHOD THAT INTEGRATES BOTH KINEMATICS AND DYNAMICS MODELING TO ACHIEVE ACCURATE AND ALSO PHYSICALLY-PLAUSIBLE HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION
utt_0016 utt 83.31 97.41 -X AT A HIGH-LEVEL SIMPOE USES A RECURRENT UNIT CALLED KINEMATICS PLUS DYNAMICS MODULE TO MAP A SEQUENCE OF VIDEO FRAMES INTO HUMAN POSES SO FROM A TEMPORAL MODELING PERSPECTIVE WE ARE ESSENTIALLY
utt_0018 utt 97.41 104.21 -X REPLACING RECURRENT UNITS SUCH AS LSTM WITH OUR MORE STRUCTURED KINEMATICS PLUS DYNAMICS MODULE
utt_0019 utt 104.37 117.94 -X THE MODULE INCLUDES A PHYSICS SIMULATOR WHICH IS LIKE A NON-DIFFERENTIABLE GATING FUNCTION THEREFORE SUPERVISED LEARNING CANNOT BE APPLIED HERE INSTEAD WE USE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING-BASED CHARACTER CONTROL TO LEARN THIS MODULE
utt_0022 utt 118.80 131.19 -X INSIDE THE MODULE WE USE A KINEMATIC POSE ESTIMATOR SUCH AS VIBE TO GET INITIAL KINEMATIC POSE FROM THE IMAGE AND WE ALSO USE A KEY POINT DETECTOR TO GET twoD KEY POINTS AND THEIR CONFIDENCE
utt_0024 utt 131.41 144.89 -X WE THEN USE A KINEMATICS-AWARE POLICY THAT TAKES AS INPUT THE KINEMATIC POSE THE KEYPOINTS AND ALSO THE CURRENT CHARACTER POSE AND VELOCITY TO PRODUCE AN ACTION AND THE ACTION IS CONVERTED
utt_0026 utt 144.89 158.71 -X BY PD CONTROLLERS TO JOIN TORQUES AND INPUT INTO THE PHYSICS SIMULATOR TO PRODUCE THE NEXT POSE OF THE CHARACTER THIS WHOLE PROCESS CAN BE LOOKED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WHERE WE
utt_0028 utt 158.71 170.75 -X USE THE KINEMATICS-AWARE POLICY TO CONTROL THE CHARACTER AGENT INSIDE PHYSICS SIMULATION AND ASSIGNS A REWARD TO THE AGENT BASED ON HOW THE GENERATED MOTION ALIGNS WITH THE GROUND TRUTH
utt_0030 utt 171.38 184.76 -X INSIDE THE KINEMATICS-AWARE POLICY WE PERFORM KINEMATICS REASONING WITH A KINEMATIC REFINEMENT UNIT THAT ITERATIVELY REFINES THE POSE ESTIMATES BASED ON THE KEYPOINTS THE REFINED
utt_0032 utt 184.76 191.07 -X POSE IS THEN USED BY A CONTROL GENERATION UNIT TO PRODUCE CONTROL ACTION OF THE CHARACTER AGENT
utt_0033 utt 192.18 196.38 -X OUR CHARACTER AGENT IS CREATED FROM HUMAN MESH MODELS SUCH AS SMPL
utt_0034 utt 197.62 202.39 -X WE USE THE SKINNING WEIGHT MATRIX TO OBTAIN THE VERTICES BELONGING TO EACH BONE
utt_0035 utt 202.74 209.34 -X AND THEN WE COMPUTE THE threeD CONVEX HOLE OF THE BONE VERTICES TO OBTAIN EACH BONE'S GEOMETRY
utt_0036 utt 210.10 214.97 -X WE DESIGN DIFFERENT REWARDS TO MATCH POLICY GENERATED MOTION WITH THE GROUND TRUTH.
utt_0037 utt 215.22 222.76 -X SPECIFICALLY WE USE REWARDS THAT MATCH JOINT ROTATION JOINT VELOCITY threeD JOINT POSITIONS
utt_0038 utt 222.78 227.53 -X AND twoD KEYPOINTS WE COMBINE THE REWARDS USING MULTIPLICATION
utt_0039 utt 229.14 235.64 -X QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT ON BOTH HUMANthree point sixM AND AN IN-HOUSE MOTION DATASET
utt_0040 utt 235.77 239.71 -X SIMPOE BEATS PRIOR KINEMATIC AND PHYSICS-BASED METHODS
utt_0041 utt 239.74 243.05 -X IN BOTH POSE-BASED AND PHYSICS-BASED METRICS
utt_0042 utt 243.23 248.97 -X IN PARTICULAR SIMPOE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTPERFORMS PRIOR PHYSICS-BASED APPROACHES
utt_0043 utt 250.20 260.73 -X HERE WE SHOW QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF SIMPOE WE CAN SEE THAT SIMPOE HAS LITTLE PHYSICAL ARTIFACTS SUCH AS FOOT SLIDING JITTER AND GROUND PENETRATION COMPARED TO
utt_0045 utt 260.73 267.15 -X KINEMATICS-BASED METHODS AND SIMPOE PRODUCES MORE NATURAL AND REALISTIC HUMAN MOTIONS
