utt_0000 utt 0.49 2.80 -X HELLO, WELCOME TO THIS FOURTH VIDEO,
utt_0001 utt 2.80 8.40 -X WHICH PRESENTS THE CHALLENGE OF CONSIDERING ANY TYPE OF INPUT DATA IN ML-EDM.
utt_0002 utt 12.01 16.40 -X HERE IS THE OUTLINE OF THE seven SHORT VIDEOS WHICH PRESENT THE MAIN IDEAS,
utt_0003 utt 16.40 20.40 -X EXTRACTED FROM THE FOUNDING PAPER OF THIS NEW FIELD OF RESEARCH.
utt_0004 utt 22.73 27.60 -X HERE IS THE IDENTITY CARD OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM OF EARLY CLASSIFICATION.
utt_0005 utt 28.11 30.87 -X TODAY WE WILL OPEN THIS LOCK.
utt_0006 utt 30.87 38.58 -X AND THE PURPOSE IS TO CONSIDER ANY TYPE OF DATA COLLECTED OVER TIME AS INPUT TO THE SYSTEM.
utt_0007 utt 39.22 44.98 -X THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF DATA WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED AS THEY ARE COLLECTED OVER TIME.
utt_0008 utt 44.98 46.68 -X THE FOLLOWING IS A NON-EXHAUSTIVE LIST:
utt_0009 utt 47.47 53.30 -X THE FIRST FAMILY OF DATA CONSISTS OF COMPLEX SIGNALS, SUCH AS MULTI-VARIATE TIME SERIES,
utt_0010 utt 53.30 54.36 -X AND VIDEOS.
utt_0011 utt 55.76 59.60 -X SEQUENCE DATA IS ALSO COLLECTED OVER TIME, SUCH AS LOG DATA.
utt_0012 utt 60.69 74.87 -X THERE ALSO EXIST GRAPHS WHICH EVOLVE OVER TIME, AS IT IS THE CASE WITH THE CUSTOMER NETWORK OF ORANGE, WHERE NODES AND LINKS CAN APPEAR AND DISAPPEAR OVER TIME.
utt_0014 utt 74.87 79.73 -X RELATIONAL DATA IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON TYPE , WHICH ALSO EVOLVES OVER TIME. INDEED,
utt_0015 utt 79.73 94.42 -X IN COMPANIES, INFORMATION SYSTEMS STORE RELATIONAL DATA, WHICH CONSIS TS IN DATA TABLES WHICH ARE LINKED TOGETHER BY KEYS. BOTH THE CONTENT AND THE STRUCTURE OF THESE RELATIONAL DATA CAN CHANGE OVER TIME.
utt_0018 utt 94.42 101.43 -X FINALLY, THE LAST EXAMPLE IS TEXTUAL DATA COLLECTED OVER TIME, SUCH AS THREADS ON A FORUM,
utt_0019 utt 101.56 104.47 -X OR SUCCESSIVE POSTS ON A SOCIAL NETWORK.
utt_0020 utt 105.20 112.25 -X AS THIS SLIDE SHOWS, THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF DATA WHICH CAN BE COLLECTED OVER TIME.
utt_0021 utt 112.25 116.44 -X BUT THAT IS NOT ALL, WE ALSO NEED TO DEFINE THE PATTERN WE WANT TO SCORE.
utt_0022 utt 116.44 124.25 -X AND FOR EACH DATA TYPE, THERE ARE SEVERAL OPTIONS. THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE INPUT DATA IS THEREFORE VERY IMPORTANT.
utt_0024 utt 124.79 132.44 -X THIS SLIDE PRESENTS ONLY TWO EXAMPLES OF DATA TYPES, CONSIDERING THE CASE OF A BINARY CLASSIFICATION WHICH AIMS AT DETECTING ANOMALIES.
utt_0026 utt 133.30 140.47 -X THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS SEQUENTIAL DATA, FOR WHICH WE SHOW HERE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF PATTERNS.
utt_0027 utt 140.47 147.68 -X IN THIS CASE, AN ANOMALY CAN BE DEFINED AS A SUSPICIOUS EVENT BELONGING TO A SEQUENCE. OR AS AN ABNORMAL SUBSEQUENCE.
utt_0029 utt 148.02 153.31 -X A LAST POSSIBILITY IS TO DEFINE AN ANOMALY AS AN ENTIRE SEQUENCE.
utt_0030 utt 153.31 154.81 -X AMONG ALL THESE POSSIBILITIES,
utt_0031 utt 155.00 163.32 -X THE CHOICE OF THE PATTERN IS MADE BY THE DATA SCIENTIST, BEFOREHAND, WHEN HE DEFINES THE LEARNING TASK RELATED TO THE USE CASE.
utt_0033 utt 163.90 169.73 -X IN THE SECOND EXAMPLE, THE DATA CONSIDERED CONSTITUTE A GRAPH WHICH EVOLVES OVER TIME.
utt_0034 utt 169.73 172.27 -X IN THAT CASE, AN ANOMALY CAN BE DEFINED AS
utt_0035 utt 172.28 180.32 -X A NODE OF THIS GRAPH, AS AN ARC OF THIS GRAPH, OR EVEN AS A SUB-PART OF THIS GRAPH.
utt_0036 utt 180.32 181.55 -X THESE EXAMPLES SHOW THAT
utt_0037 utt 182.49 188.29 -X THE DEVELOPMENT OF ML-EDM APPROACHES WHICH ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH CASE WOULD BE A TEDIOUS TASK.
utt_0038 utt 189.63 195.81 -X THIS IS WHY WE PROPOSE THE CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING DATA-TYPE AGNOSTIC APPROACHES.
utt_0039 utt 195.81 204.96 -X IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTICE THAT, IN THE SUB-CASE OF EARLY CLASSIFICATION OF TIME SERIES, THERE ARE ALREADY AGNOSTIC APPROACHES IN THE LITERATURE.
utt_0041 utt 204.96 212.93 -X BUT THIS IS NOT EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE PAPERS. AS AN EXAMPLE, HERE ARE THE REFERENCES OF TWO PAPERS WHERE THIS IS THE CASE.
utt_0043 utt 213.37 218.72 -X THIS CHALLENGE IS RELATED TO BOTH THE DESIGN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EDM ALGORITHMS.
utt_0044 utt 220.16 221.99 -X REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION,
utt_0045 utt 221.99 227.65 -X WE RECOMMEND USING A PIVOT FORMAT TO MAKE THE ALGORITHM DATA-TYPE AGNOSTIC.
utt_0046 utt 227.65 233.86 -X HERE IS A PROPOSAL OF WHAT THIS PIVOT FORMAT CAN BE, IN THE CASE OF CLASSIFICATION PROBLEMS.
utt_0047 utt 234.49 243.27 -X IN THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION, THE INPUT DATA CAN BE OF ANY TYPE, AND HERE WE CONSIDER THE EXAMPLE OF GRAPH DATA.
utt_0049 utt 243.27 250.95 -X THEN, A COLLECTION OF TIME INDEXED MODELS IS LEARNED, THROUGH A FEATURE ENGINEERING STEP WHICH REMAINS SPECIFIC TO THE INPUT DATA-TYPE.
utt_0051 utt 252.32 255.08 -X TO CARRY OUT THE LEARNING OF THE TRIGGERING MODEL,
utt_0052 utt 255.33 265.89 -X THE TRAINING SET IS RECODED USING A PIVOT FORMAT. THIS PIVOT FORMAT MUST BE AGNOSTIC TO THE TYPE OF INPUT DATA, BUT IT IS SPECIFIC TO THE LEARNING TASK.
utt_0054 utt 266.72 281.03 -X IN OUR EXAMPLE, A CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM IS CONSIDERED. AND THE TRAINING EXAMPLES ARE ENCODED BY A MATRIX WHOSE ROWS CORRESPOND TO EACH EXAMPLE, AND THE COLUMNS CORRESPOND TO THE TEMPORAL INDEX.
utt_0056 utt 281.03 286.53 -X IN THE CELLS OF THIS MATRIX, A SPECIFIC FORMAT FOR THE LEARNING TASK IS UDES. HERE,
utt_0057 utt 286.53 291.56 -X IT IS THE VECTOR OF CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES ESTIMATED BY THE CLASSIFIER.
utt_0058 utt 291.56 301.10 -X FINALLY, THE DATA-TYPE AGNOSTICITY PROPERTY ALREADY EXISTS IN THE LITERATURE, BUT IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL ONE.
utt_0060 utt 301.99 313.06 -X WE ENCOURAGE RESEARCHERS WHO WILL PUBLISH PAPERS IN EDM TO EMPHASIZE THIS PROPERTY IN THEIR FUTURE WORK, IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE METHODS.
utt_0062 utt 314.40 326.60 -X TO CONCLUDE, IN THIS VIDEO WE HAVE POINTED OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGNING DATA-TYPE AGNOSTIC APPROACHES, BY SPECIFYING PIVOTAL FORMATS FOR EACH TYPE OF LEARNING TASK.
utt_0064 utt 326.60 329.90 -X IN THE NEXT VIDEO, WE WILL DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES OF ONLINE ML-EDM.
utt_0065 utt 331.88 334.03 -3.3354 THANKS A LOT! SEE YOU SOON!
