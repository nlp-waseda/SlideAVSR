utt_0006 utt 24.94 28.03 -X COHERENT STYLE LEVEL GENERATION FROM A SINGLE EXAMPLE
utt_0007 utt 28.97 34.93 -X FOR THE sixteenTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTERACTIVE DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT IN two thousand and twenty.
utt_0009 utt 35.79 37.81 -X THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN BY MYSELF,
utt_0010 utt 37.81 44.56 -X FREDERIK SCHUBERT AND BODO ROSENHAHN FROM THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION PROCESSING AT LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITY HANNOVER.
utt_0014 utt 56.82 58.96 -X INCLUDING EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS,
utt_0015 utt 59.15 60.75 -X MONTE-CARLO TREE SEARCH,
utt_0019 utt 75.89 80.34 -X ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS OR GANS HAVE ACHIEVED GOOD RESULTS.
utt_0027 utt 111.16 115.86 -X ONE SHOT ARBITRARY DIMENSION GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK.
utt_0028 utt 116.47 120.15 -X WE'RE DEALING WITH TOKEN-BASED MAPS OF LEVELS.
utt_0029 utt 120.15 128.37 -X THESE CAN BE CONVERTED NICELY INTO TENSORS BY MAKING A BINARY LAYER FOR EACH TOKEN REPRESENTING ITS OCCURRENCES IN THE LEVEL.
utt_0031 utt 128.37 141.49 -X OUR METHOD IS ONE SHOT WHICH MEANS IT ONLY GETS ONE LEVEL AT A TIME TO TRAIN ON AND IT CAN GENERATE LEVELS OF ARBITRARY DIMENSIONS DUE TO ITS ARCHITECTURE AS A FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK OR GAN.
utt_0036 utt 145.14 147.70 -X A BASIC GAN CONSISTS OF TWO NETWORKS:
utt_0037 utt 147.70 149.56 -X A GENERATOR AND A DISCRIMINATOR.
utt_0038 utt 149.91 159.64 -X THE GENERATOR TAKES AN INPUT FROM A CERTAIN KNOWN RANDOMIZED DISTRIBUTION AND TRIES TO GENERATE FROM THAT A SAMPLE OF THE REAL DISTRIBUTION, IN OUR CASE LEVELS.
utt_0041 utt 159.89 170.90 -X BUT FOR THE GENERATOR TO MAKE MEANINGFUL SAMPLES IT NEEDS GOOD FEEDBACK ON HOW TO CHANGE ITS OUTPUT TO MAKE IT MORE LIKE THE REAL DISTRIBUTION. THIS FEEDBACK IS PROVIDED BY THE
utt_0045 utt 170.90 185.40 -X DISCRIMINATOR WHICH RANDOMLY GETS EITHER A SAMPLE FROM THE REAL DISTRIBUTION OR THE FAKE GENERATED DISTRIBUTION AS AN INPUT AND THEN HAS TO PREDICT FROM WHICH DISTRIBUTION IT ORIGINALLY CAME. THE GOAL DURING TRAINING IS NOW FOR BOTH
utt_0049 utt 185.40 196.86 -X THE GENERATOR AND THE DISCRIMINATOR TO GET BETTER AND BETTER AT THEIR TASKS UNTIL THE GENERATED SAMPLES ARE SO CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL SAMPLES THAT THE DISCRIMINATOR CAN NO LONGER DISTINGUISH THE TWO.
utt_0058 utt 215.86 223.64 -X TRAINING LIKE THAT IS MADE POSSIBLE BY COMPRISING THE NETWORK OF CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS WHOSE OUTPUT SIZE DEPENDS ON THAT OF THE INPUT.
utt_0060 utt 223.86 231.80 -X WITH THAT WE CAN USE A NOISE MAP WITH PREDEFINED SIZE AS AN INPUT WHICH RESULTS IN AN OUTPUT LEVEL OF ANY DESIRED ARBITRARY SIZE.
utt_0064 utt 239.22 246.91 -X IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEVEL MAKES SENSE AS A WHOLE WE INSTEAD USE MULTIPLE GANS THAT ARE TRAINED ON DIFFERENT SCALES OF THE LEVEL.
utt_0066 utt 246.91 260.88 -X WE UPSCALE AND ADD THE OUTPUT OF THE SMALLER SCALE TO THE NEW NOISE MAP EACH SCALE, WIDENING THE FIELD OF VIEW AND MAKING SURE THAT BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL PATTERNS ARE LEARNED. FOR THIS TO WORK WE NEED TO SCALE DOWN
utt_0069 utt 260.88 264.32 -X THE ORIGINAL LEVEL FIRST WHICH POSES A UNIQUE PROBLEM.
utt_0075 utt 285.18 288.92 -X DOWNSAMPLING ALGORITHM BASED ON A PREDEFINED TOKEN HIERARCHY.
utt_0076 utt 289.30 302.49 -X FOR EACH ENTRY IN THE DOWNSCALED LEVEL WE FIND THE POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR THAT SPOT BY CHECKING WHICH TOKENS IN THE LARGER LEVEL NEED TO BE COLLAPSED INTO ONE. THEN WE RANK THESE CANDIDATES ACCORDING
utt_0079 utt 302.49 316.32 -X TO THE HIERARCHY AND ONLY KEEP THE VALUES OF THE HIGHEST RANK AVAILABLE. IN THE END WE ADJUST THE VALUES WITH A SOFTMAX FUNCTION TO MAKE THE RESULTING IMAGE MORE SIMILAR TO THE FINAL OUTPUT OF THE GAN, WHICH ENDS WITH A SOFTMAX AS WELL.
utt_0088 utt 337.18 351.42 -X AND RESAMPLED EASILY. IF YOU WANT TO TRY GENERATING AND EDITING SOME LEVELS YOURSELF CHECK OUR GITHUB FOR TOAD-GUI WHERE WE PROVIDE TOAD-GANS FOR THE DIFFERENT SUPER MARIO BROS. LEVELS AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO GENERATE LEVELS OF ARBITRARY SIZES
utt_0092 utt 351.58 354.02 -X EDIT THEM AND YOU CAN EVEN PLAY THEM.
utt_0093 utt 354.33 366.06 -X HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF GENERATED LEVELS FROM DIFFERENT GENERATORS. WHILE THERE ARE STILL SOME AREAS WE HUMANS WOULD DEFINE AS ERRORS LIKE BROKEN PIPES AND PLATFORMS, OVERALL
utt_0096 utt 366.30 370.53 -X THE LEVELS LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE REINTERPRETATIONS OF THE ORIGINAL LEVEL.
utt_0097 utt 371.32 377.60 -X SMALL PATTERNS LIKE THESE THREE PLATFORMS OVER HERE ARE LEARNED AND EVEN VARIED IN THE GENERATION PROCESS.
utt_0107 utt 411.39 415.73 -X ORIGINAL LEVEL. THESE ARE THE RESULTS. FOR COMPARISON
utt_0108 utt 415.93 419.62 -X HERE ARE THE MEAN TPKL-DIVERGENCES PROVIDED IN OTHER PAPERS.
utt_0109 utt 420.00 424.07 -X WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT TOAD-GANS CAPTURE THE ORIGINAL TILE PATTERNS
utt_0111 utt 430.23 432.48 -X GENERATORS AND LEVELS THEY WERE NOT TRAINED ON.
utt_0112 utt 432.86 436.61 -X THIS SHOWS THAT CERTAIN LEVELS HAVE A LARGE SIMILARITY IN PATTERNS.
utt_0113 utt 436.83 449.16 -X THESE LEVELS BELONG TO THE SAME TYPE OF LEVEL AND THEREFORE ARE SIMILAR PATTERNS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE FOR FLOATING PLATFORM LEVELS WHOSE PLATFORMS DO NOT OCCUR WITHIN OTHER TYPES OF LEVEL.
utt_0116 utt 449.22 452.63 -X TO BETTER VISUALIZE THE SIMILARITY OF NOT ONLY
utt_0124 utt 482.88 497.24 -X WE NOW CALCULATE THE EMBEDDING FOR ALL sixteen BY sixteen SLICES FROM THE ORIGINAL LEVELS AND MAP IT. THIS LOOKS LIKE THIS. LOOKING AT THIS DISTRIBUTION, WE CAN SEE THAT THE LEVEL TYPES LIKE OVERWORLD, UNDERGROUND AND FLOATING PLATFORMS MAP
utt_0127 utt 497.24 512.05 -X TO CLEARLY DISTINCT AND FAR APART PLACES SHOWING THAT THE DISTANCE IN THE SPACE IS REPRESENTATIVE. NOW MAPPING ALL SLICES FROM OUR TRAINED TOAD-GANS WITH THE SAME TRANSFORMATION REVEALS THAT THEY MAP TO THE SAME AREAS AS THE ORIGINAL LEVELS
utt_0131 utt 512.07 516.68 -X KEEPING THE LEVEL STYLE THEY WERE TRAINED ON WHILE SHOWING SOME VARIANCE WITHIN.
utt_0135 utt 527.30 533.97 -X THIS IS ALL WHILE THE COMPLETABILITY OF THE LEVELS IS COMPARABLE TO THE ORIGINALS ACCORDING TO A STATE-OF-THE-ART SOLVER
utt_0152 utt 589.08 593.64 -3.7238 AS A HELP FOR GAME DESIGNERS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD FOR IT TO BE USED
