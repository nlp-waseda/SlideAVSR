utt_0000 utt 0.72 15.63 -X HI, I'M PHILIPPE PALANQUE. I'M THE SITE SELECTION DIRECTOR WITHIN CHI STEERING COMMITTEE. AND I'M HERE TO DISCLOSE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT CHI two thousand and twenty-three CONFERENCE, AND ALSO TO TELL YOU A BIT MORE ABOUT THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR CHI CONFERENCES. I GUESS MOST OF
utt_0004 utt 15.69 26.87 -X YOU ARE CURRENTLY ATTENDING THE CHI two thousand and twenty-one CONFERENCE THAT UNFORTUNATELY, CANNOT HAPPEN PHYSICALLY, BUT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING VIRTUALLY. AND I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT CHI two thousand and twenty-two
utt_0007 utt 26.87 35.48 -X WILL TAKE PLACE IN NEW ORLEANS IN THE USA NEXT YEAR. WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT ORGANIZED PHYSICALLY. SO A
utt_0009 utt 36.21 47.48 -X BIT OF SUSPENSE FOR CHI two thousand and twenty-three. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TRY TO WRITE DOWN IMMEDIATELY THE NAME OF THE CITY IN WHICH THE CONFERENCE WILL TAKE PLACE.
utt_0012 utt 47.60 51.06 -X AND ALSO TRY TO WRITE THE NUMBER OF SECONDS THAT HAVE BEEN
utt_0014 utt 58.01 64.10 -X TO BE READY AND YOU HAVE TO BE ALERT. BUT, I WILL GIVE YOU OF COURSE, SOME HINTS, SO YOU CAN FIND THE LOCATION MORE
utt_0016 utt 64.88 74.14 -X EASILY. THE FIRST HINT IS THAT WE USUALLY DON'T HAVE CHI CONFERENCE HAPPENING IN THE SAME LOCATION SEVERAL TIMES, AT LEAST WE TRY TO AVOID THAT. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS CHI CONFERENCES,
utt_0019 utt 75.76 83.35 -X YOU CAN TRY TO GUESS IN WHICH CONTINENT, THE CONFERENCE WILL TAKE PLACE. OKAY? NOW I CAN TELL YOU
utt_0021 utt 83.76 87.34 -X MORE PRECISE AND BREAKING NEWS INFORMATION, WHICH IS THAT
utt_0022 utt 87.54 91.61 -X CHI two thousand and twenty-three, WE'LL GO BACK TO EUROPE. I KNOW IT'S A GOOD HINT,
utt_0023 utt 91.61 94.84 -X BUT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH, BECAUSE IN FACT, EUROPE IS PRETTY LARGE.
utt_0024 utt 94.84 107.90 -X AND YOU HAVE HERE A PICTURE OF EUROPE. YOU CAN TRY TO LOCATE THE CITY THAT WILL HOST CHI WHICH IS VISIBLE. IT'S CURRENTLY DISPLAYED ON THIS MAP, WHERE CHI two thousand and twenty-three WILL TAKE PLACE. IF YOU HAVE NOT FOUND YET I WILL GIVE YOU SOME MORE HINT. FIRST A
utt_0028 utt 107.90 110.73 -X A SHORT VIDEO, THEN SOME FAMOUS PEOPLE FROM THAT PLACE
utt_0029 utt 111.00 121.18 -X AND WHO WERE BORN IN THAT CITY. AND THEN THE MOST FAMOUS INVENTION FROM THIS CITY THAT IS COMING FROM THE sixteenTH CENTURY AND MORE PRECISELY FROM one thousand, seven hundred and fifty-eight.
utt_0031 utt 121.46 124.51 -X SO MAYBE WITH THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION YOU ALREADY KNOW,
utt_0032 utt 124.51 130.91 -X BECAUSE THIS INVENTION IS VERY FAMOUS, AND EVERYBODY HERE HAS BEEN TRYING IT AT LEAST ONCE. SO COMING BACK TO THE HINTS, THE
utt_0034 utt 131.90 135.93 -X FIRST HINT IS THE VIDEO THAT WILL GIVE YOU SOME CONCRETE INFORMATION.
utt_0035 utt 135.93 150.03 -X SO I SHOW YOU THE VIDEO RIGHT NOW, IT'S A VERY SHORT VIDEO, YOU ONLY HAVE ten SECONDS. I DON'T TELL YOU MORE. IT'S A VIDEO THAT SHOWS SOME OBJECTS. IT SHOWS YOU ALSO SOME TECHNOLOGY, MAYBE SOME AI-BASED TECHNOLOGY, I CAN'T TELL. BUT
utt_0039 utt 150.03 152.80 -X WHAT I CAN TELL YOU NOW IS THAT ONE OF THE OBJECTS THAT WAS
utt_0040 utt 153.21 156.61 -X DISPLAYED IN THIS VIDEO IS EXACTLY COMING FROM THAT CITY.
utt_0041 utt 156.61 166.91 -X AND THAT'S THE ONE I WAS TRYING TO MAKE YOU GUESS. SECOND INFORMATION MAY GIVE YOU SOME HINT ABOUT THE COUNTRY WHERE CHI two thousand and twenty-three WILL TAKE PLACE. THE MOST FAMOUS POLITICIANS FROM THIS COUNTRY ARE HELMUTH SCHMIDT
utt_0044 utt 167.36 180.48 -X AND ANGELA MERKEL. SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA IF YOU'RE, OF COURSE FROM EUROPE, BUT FROM OUTSIDE IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE DIFFICULT. I CAN GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ALSO RELATED MORE TO THE CHI CONFERENCE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
utt_0048 utt 180.48 188.26 -X BEEN DOING SOME ENGINEERING, SO HENRICH HERTZ IS FROM THAT COUNTRY AND BORN IN THAT CITY. AND ON THE DESIGN SIDE OF
utt_0050 utt 188.86 193.12 -X THE WORLD, YOU HAVE KARL LAGERFELD WHO WAS A FAMOUS DESIGNER,

utt_0085 utt 324.72 338.60 -X IT PRESENTS HOW WE MAKE THE SITE SELECTION FOR CHI. AND YOU SEE THE VARIOUS ENTITIES OR ORGANIZATION INVOLVED IN THIS SELECTION. SO IN YELLOW, YOU SEE ACM, YOU SEE IN GREEN THE STEERING COMMITTEE OF CHI, AND YOU SEE IN BLUE
utt_0089 utt 339.50 353.97 -X THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF SIGCHI. SO ALL THESE THREE ENTITIES WORK TOGETHER TO SELECT A SITE, TO GIVE SOME RULES ABOUT THE SITE TO SELECT, TO SELECT SOME POSSIBILITIES FOR THE SITE, AND THEN TO MAKE A FINAL SELECTION. AND YOU SEE
