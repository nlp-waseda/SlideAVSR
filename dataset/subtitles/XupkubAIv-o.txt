utt_0007 utt 35.41 38.64 -X IS THAT THEY'RE A BIT LIKE PORTABLE FABRICATION DEVICES,
utt_0008 utt 38.93 43.92 -X SINCE THEY ALLOW YOU TO TRANSLATE EXPERIENCE INTO A PHYSICAL FORM ON THE GO.
utt_0010 utt 51.06 55.35 -X BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR US TO MAKE THEM DYNAMIC?
utt_0012 utt 60.89 67.22 -X OR THE MOTION PHOTOS ON ANDROID DEVICES, BUT HOW DO WE MAKE AN ANALOG INSTANT PHOTO MOVE?
utt_0013 utt 68.21 80.92 -X WE COULD TRY MAKING A FLIP BOOK: THEY'RE EASY TO MAKE AND CAN EASILY BE INTEGRATED INTO AN INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHY WORKFLOW. HOWEVER, THEY CAN ALSO BE A BIT FLIMSY AND AWKWARD TO USE.
utt_0015 utt 81.75 85.98 -X LENTICULAR PRINTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE INTUITIVE TO INTERACT WITH,
utt_0016 utt 86.20 91.90 -X BUT REQUIRE LENTICULAR SHEETS THAT CAN ONLY BE MADE USING SPECIAL MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES
utt_0019 utt 103.54 109.79 -X AND EASY TO INTERACT WITH LIKE A LENTICULAR PRINT SO WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S IN BETWEEN THE TWO.
utt_0020 utt 111.77 124.09 -X THIS BRINGS US TO AN OLD SCHOOL ANIMATION TECHNIQUE CALLED THE BARRIER GRID ANIMATION OR KINEGRAM. THE IDEA IS SIMPLE: YOU START WITH A FEW FRAMES OF ANIMATION -- SO IN THIS
utt_0022 utt 124.09 129.05 -X CASE WE START WITH THREE FRAMES -- AND THEN YOU SPLIT UP EACH FRAME INTO STRIPS.
utt_0023 utt 129.30 132.86 -X YOU THEN INTERLACE THE STRIPS AND COMPOSITE THE RESULT.
utt_0024 utt 133.34 144.12 -X WHEN YOU SLIDE A STRIPED OVERLAY ACROSS THE COMPOSITED IMAGE, IT CREATES THE ILLUSION OF MOTION BECAUSE THE STRIPE PATTERN ENSURES THAT ONLY ONE FULL FRAME IS VISIBLE AT A TIME.
utt_0026 utt 146.74 151.32 -X KINEGRAMS ARE NICE BECAUSE THEY CAN BE MADE USING SIMPLE FABRICATION TECHNIQUES.
utt_0027 utt 151.77 158.27 -X IMAGES CAN BE PRINTED WITH ANY KIND OF PRINTER AND THE STRIPED OVERLAYS CAN BE PRINTED ON REGULAR TRANSPARENCY FILM.
utt_0029 utt 160.12 173.41 -X AND THIS BRINGS US TO KINECAM: IT'S A DEVICE THAT CREATES ANIMATED INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHS BY CAPTURING AND FABRICATING KINEGRAMS ON THE SPOT. HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT RECORDS A SHORT ONE-SECOND VIDEO
utt_0031 utt 173.50 179.84 -X AND USES THE FIRST, MIDDLE, AND LAST FRAMES TO CREATE THE KINEGRAM.
utt_0032 utt 181.53 194.34 -X ONE NICE THING ABOUT KINECAM IS THAT IT IS OPEN-SOURCE AND MADE FROM OFF-THE-SHELF COMPONENTS THAT COST LESS THAN $one hundred ALTOGETHER. YOU JUST NEED A RASPBERRY PI, A CAMERA, AND A THERMAL PRINTER,
utt_0034 utt 194.34 198.37 -X WHICH IS THE SAME KIND OF PRINTER THAT PEOPLE USE TO CREATE RECEIPTS.
utt_0036 utt 203.94 206.11 -X HOW THE SUBJECTS INTERACTED WITH THE CAMERA.
utt_0037 utt 207.20 216.13 -X WE NOTICED THAT KINECAM WAS ENCOURAGING PLAY AND EXPERIMENTATION THANKS TO ITS SHORT TURNAROUND TIMES AND EASY TO OBTAIN MATERIALS.
utt_0039 utt 216.13 222.45 -X THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE IMPORTANT SINCE BOTH PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THEIR SUBJECTS RELY ON ITERATION
utt_0040 utt 222.46 226.95 -X TO ACQUAINT THEMSELVES WITH KINECAM'S LESS CONVENTIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS.
utt_0041 utt 228.51 240.26 -X KINECAM ALSO FUNCTIONS AS A SOCIAL TOOL. THE PRESENCE OF A CAMERA CAN MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY OR DO UNEXPECTED THINGS, AND WE HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THIS WITH KINECAM.
utt_0043 utt 240.90 250.66 -X SINCE SUBJECTS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE CAMERA, IT OFFERED AN EXPERIENCE IN WHICH THEY COULD DISCOVER AND LEARN THE BEHAVIORS AND AFFORDANCES OF THE CAMERA TOGETHER.
utt_0047 utt 264.19 265.86 -X OR SLAPPING EACH OTHER'S FACES
utt_0048 utt 269.57 273.83 -X KINECAM ALSO CREATES UNIQUE PHYSICAL ARTIFACTS AND EXPERIENCES.
utt_0050 utt 280.55 291.91 -X BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE-OF-A-KIND, SO THIS ALSO APPLIES TO KINECAM: THE IMAGE ISN'T STORED IN MEMORY SO IT'S NOT EASILY REPRODUCED, AND VIEWING THE KINEGRAM ITSELF IS ALSO AN EXPERIENCE
utt_0052 utt 291.91 305.23 -X THAT VARIES EACH TIME THE USER MOVES THE FILTER ACROSS THE IMAGE. WHILE USERS CAN TECHNICALLY SCAN AND REPRINT THE KINEGRAM LATER ON, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE TRUE RECEIPT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE.
utt_0054 utt 306.85 317.83 -X FINALLY, KINECAM CREATES SURPRISES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CREATIVE TOOLS WHICH INCORPORATE SOME DEGREE OF UNEXPECTEDNESS CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS.
utt_0056 utt 317.96 322.89 -X SINCE KINECAM DOES NOT ALLOW USERS TO PREVIEW OR EDIT THEIR KINEGRAM BEFORE PRINTING,
utt_0057 utt 323.05 327.21 -X USERS REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT UNTIL THE PHOTOS ARE PRINTED.
utt_0058 utt 327.21 332.88 -X WHILE THIS TAKES CONTROL AWAY FROM THE USER, IT CAN ALSO PRODUCE SERENDIPITOUS RESULTS.
utt_0059 utt 333.22 344.33 -X FOR EXAMPLE, ONE SUBJECT IN OUR PHOTO SHOOT WANTED TO RECORD A GESTURE IN WHICH HE FORMS A HEART WITH HIS ARMS, BUT SINCE HE DIDN'T TIME THE GESTURE TO FIT WITHIN THE ONE SECOND WINDOW
utt_0061 utt 344.36 349.93 -X THE RESULTING KINEGRAM LOOKED LIKE HE WAS FLAPPING HIS ARMS. INSTEAD OF REDOING THE POSE,
utt_0062 utt 349.93 354.32 -1.7368 THE SUBJECT WAS AMUSED BY THE OUTCOME AND APPRECIATED THE UNEXPECTED RESULT.
