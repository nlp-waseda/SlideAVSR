utt_0000 utt 2.48 6.99 -X HEY I'M DANIEL. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AI METHODS TO DEAL WITH
utt_0001 utt 7.02 12.69 -X NUMERICAL AND GRANULAR DATA STREAMS THAT MAY COME FROM A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS AND DOMAINS.
utt_0002 utt 13.13 26.90 -X WE HAVE RECENTLY STARTED TO APPROACH THE AREA OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE, AND HERE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE BRAIN ACTIVITY IN REAL TIME FROM INDIVIDUALS PLAYING COMPUTER GAMES. WE DO
utt_0004 utt 26.90 32.34 -X THAT BY MEANS OF AN APPROACH WE PROPOSED LAST YEAR CALLED EVOLVING GAUSSIAN FUZZY CLASSIFIER.
utt_0005 utt 32.34 41.17 -X THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROCESS AND LEARN FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA STREAMS, SPECIFICALLY
utt_0006 utt 41.17 49.81 -X FROM ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM DATA STREAMS. THE MODELS ARE CLASSIFIERS THAT SHOULD RECOGNIZE
utt_0007 utt 49.81 63.60 -X BRAIN ACTIVITY IN REAL TIME. MODELS ARE DEVELOPED FROM SCRATCH, AUTONOMOUSLY. SO, THE APPROACH FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MODELS IS CALLED EGFC, EVOLVING GAUSSIAN FUZZY CLASSIFIER OR ALGORITHM.
utt_0009 utt 64.97 72.37 -X THESE ARE THE GAMES AND THE CLASSES. THE CLASSES ARE THE PREDOMINANT STATES REPORTED BY THE PLAYERS
utt_0010 utt 72.75 77.33 -X AFTER PLAYING EACH OF THE GAMES. THE CLASSES ARE: 'BOREDOM', 'CALMNESS',
utt_0011 utt 77.33 82.48 -X 'FEARFULNESS', AND 'JOYFULNESS'. WE FORMALIZE THE PROBLEM THIS WAY.
utt_0012 utt 82.96 92.69 -X WE HAVE A RELATION 'F', WHICH MAPS THE INPUT VECTOR IN AN OUTPUT. F IS IN GENERAL NONLINEAR.
utt_0013 utt 93.84 102.20 -X THE FUNCTION IS UNKNOWN. SO WE SEEK 'F PRIME', A MODEL OF F, FROM A DATA STREAM (X,Y).
utt_0014 utt 102.58 109.75 -X AS WE CONSIDERED PARTIALLY LABELED DATA, THE OUTPUT Y MAY NOT BE GIVEN TOGETHER WITH THE
utt_0015 utt 109.84 118.52 -X INPUT VECTOR X. SO WE HAVE THE EMPTY SET AS A POSSIBILITY TO Y. THE FUNCTION F IN
utt_0016 utt 118.52 125.49 -X GENERAL IS TIME VARYING AS WE ARE IN ONLINE ENVIRONMENT. SO WE NEED AN ONLINE ALGORITHM
utt_0017 utt 126.51 133.91 -X TO CHANGE THE CLASS BOUNDARIES GIVEN BY THE MODEL TO TRACK THE CHANGES IN THE DATA SOURCES.
utt_0018 utt 136.82 151.28 -X EGFC USES ZERO-ORDER TAKAGI-SUGENO RULES. THE RULES EVOLVE OVER TIME EVOLVE THEIR PARAMETERS. AND THE RULE BASE ITSELF EVOLVES. WE HAVE GAUSSIANS - GAUSSIAN MEMBERSHIP
utt_0020 utt 151.28 156.56 -X FUNCTIONS - IN THE ANTECEDENT TERMS OF THE RULES AND IN THE CONSEQUENT TERM WE HAVE CLASS LABELS.
utt_0021 utt 156.78 166.81 -X RULES ARE ACTIVATED IN A DEGREE, SO THEY ARE FUZZY RULES AND, AS MORE THAN ONE RULE CAN BE ACTIVATED
utt_0022 utt 167.28 173.17 -X AT ANY TIME STEP, IN THE DATA SPACE WE WILL HAVE SMOOTH CLASS BOUNDARIES.
utt_0023 utt 176.15 184.02 -X THERE IS AN ONLINE LEARNING ALGORITHM TO SUPPORT MODEL DEVELOPMENT. WE CAN ADD A NEW RULE TO THE
utt_0024 utt 184.02 193.97 -X CURRENT SET OF RULES 'THIS WAY'. IT HAPPENS... THE ADDITION OF A NEW RULE HAPPENS IF THE ACTIVATION
utt_0025 utt 193.97 202.77 -X LEVEL OF ALL THE RULES, THAT IS GIVEN BY THE T-NORM AGGREGATION (BY AN AGGREGATION OPERATOR)
utt_0026 utt 203.12 212.57 -X CONCERNING THE MEMBERSHIP DEGREE OF THE VALUES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS. SO,
utt_0027 utt 212.57 223.38 -X IF ALL THESE THESE OPERATIONS GIVE VALUES THAT ARE LESS OR EQUAL THAN A TIME-VARYING THRESHOLD RHO,
utt_0028 utt 224.50 230.07 -X WE SHOULD CREATE ANOTHER RULE, AND ITS PARAMETERS ARE SET 'THIS WAY'.
utt_0029 utt 230.07 240.82 -X 'THIS' (RHO) IS AN IMPORTANT HYPER-PARAMETER OF THE EGFC ALGORITHM SO WE DID IT ADAPTIVE
utt_0030 utt 240.82 247.22 -X OVER TIME TO HAVE STREAM-DEPENDENT GRANULARITY AND ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD.
utt_0031 utt 247.22 252.86 -X 'IT' DEPENDS ON ON 'THIS RECURSIVE EQUATION' AND THE VALUES OF THE
utt_0032 utt 253.14 262.17 -X STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE GAUSSIANS, WHICH IN FACT DEPEND ON THE DATA STREAM.
utt_0033 utt 262.17 269.24 -X WE CAN UPDATE AN EXISTING RULE, 'R I STAR', IF THIS RULE IS SUFFICIENTLY ACTIVATED
utt_0034 utt 269.24 277.75 -X ACCORDING TO THE THRESHOLD. THE PARAMETERS OF THE GAUSSIANS ARE UPDATED RECURSIVELY.
utt_0035 utt 277.97 287.74 -X EVERYTHING IN THE ALGORITHM IS RECURSIVE. 'THIS' IS THE UPDATE OF THE MODAL VALUE OF THE MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS, AND THE STANDARD DEVIATION.
utt_0037 utt 288.85 292.76 -X WE CAN MERGE GRANULES, GAUSSIAN GRANULES,
utt_0038 utt 293.11 306.75 -X OVER TIME AND, OF COURSE, THE RULES THAT GOVERN THE GRANULES. WE USED FOR THAT THIS DISTANCE MEASURE, WHICH IS USEFUL FOR GAUSSIAN OBJECTS IN THE DATA SPACE.
utt_0040 utt 309.01 321.69 -X THE RULES TO BE MERGED SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED TO THE SAME CLASS LABEL OR BOTH BE UNLABELED FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. WE ARE IN A SEMI-SUPERVISED ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0042 utt 322.20 331.98 -X THE MERGED GRANULE HAS PARAMETERS SET 'THIS WAY'. ANOTHER PROCEDURE WITHIN THE LEARNING ALGORITHM IS
utt_0043 utt 332.41 346.36 -X THE POSSIBILITY TO DELETE RULES BY... IF IT (THE RULE) IS INACTIVE FOR A NUMBER OF TIME STEPS. WE DELETE IT BECAUSE IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.
utt_0045 utt 346.93 354.87 -X WELL, THE PUBLIC DATASET CONTAINS EEG DATA FROM twenty-eight INDIVIDUALS WHICH PLAY... THEY PLAY THE GAMES
utt_0046 utt 354.87 363.84 -X FOR five MINUTES twenty MINUTES IN TOTAL. 'THIS' IS THE ORDER OF THE PLAYERS (MALE AND FEMALE PLAYERS).
utt_0047 utt 365.98 376.06 -X THE GAMES ARE ASSOCIATED TO THE AROUSAL-VALENCE CIRCLE SO THAT WE HAVE A GAME PER QUADRANT
utt_0048 utt 376.06 385.18 -X OF 'THIS CIRCLE'. THE FIRST GAME IS ASSOCIATED TO 'BORED'. THE SECOND ONE TO 'CALM' 'ANGRY' AND
utt_0049 utt 385.18 394.40 -X 'HAPPY' FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH GAMES. WELL, THE IDEA IS TO DEVELOP A SINGLE USER-INDEPENDENT EGFC.
utt_0050 utt 395.29 405.15 -X WE WANT A GENERAL MODEL WHICH CAPTURES PATTERNS FROM ALL THE twenty-eight INDIVIDUALS AND NOT A CUSTOMIZED
utt_0051 utt 405.15 415.32 -X MODEL FOR A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A BETTER ACCURACY, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
utt_0052 utt 417.91 423.77 -X WE EXTRACT one hundred and forty ATTRIBUTES FROM THE FOURIER SPECTRA OF fourteen ELECTRODES: SEVEN IN EACH BRAIN HEMISPHERE.
utt_0053 utt 424.41 432.40 -X FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE TAKE AN ELECTRODE IN THE FRONTAL LOBE. AND WE TAKE THE DATA WITHIN A
utt_0054 utt 432.40 440.03 -X TIME WINDOW, AND PERFORM THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OVER THESE DATA, WE HAVE A SPECTRUM LIKE 'THIS'.
utt_0055 utt 440.38 448.64 -X WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE RANGE OF VALUES FROM one TO sixty-four HERTZ. WE DIVIDED THE SPECTRUM IN FIVE BANDS:
utt_0056 utt 448.64 456.29 -X THE 'DELTA', 'THETA, 'ALPHA', 'BETA', AND 'GAMMA' BANDS AND WE EXTRACT THE MEAN AND MAXIMUM VALUES
utt_0057 utt 456.29 463.84 -X IN EACH OF THE BANDS. SO WE HAVE ten ATTRIBUTES PER CHANNEL, AND one hundred and forty ATTRIBUTES FOR THE WHOLE BRAIN.
utt_0058 utt 466.65 474.30 -X WE PERFORMED TWO EXPERIMENTS. FIRST, WE WANT TO ANALYZE SINGLE ELECTRODES WE WANT TO
utt_0059 utt 475.00 483.93 -X KNOW WHICH ARE THE MOST PROMISING AREAS OF THE BRAIN TO HELP PATTERN RECOGNITION. AND THEN, THE
utt_0060 utt 483.93 491.62 -X GENERAL MULTIPLE CHANNEL EXPERIMENT CONSIDERING A RANK OF ALL THE ATTRIBUTES AND LEAVING SOME
utt_0061 utt 491.62 500.48 -X ATTRIBUTES OUT AT A TIME. THE PERFORMANCE INDICES ARE THE ACCURACY OF THE CLASSIFIER,
utt_0062 utt 500.67 509.25 -X EGFC AND THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CLASSIFIER GIVEN BY THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF RULES IN THE RULE BASE.
utt_0063 utt 510.84 516.48 -X WE NOTICED FROM THE SINGLE CHANNEL EXPERIMENT, CONSIDERING five-MINUTE, one-MINUTE, thirty-SECOND, AND
utt_0064 utt 516.48 527.62 -X ten-SECOND TIME WINDOWS, THAT WE HAD NO PATTERNS FOR five-MINUTE TIME WINDOWS. WE COULD NOT NOTICE
utt_0065 utt 528.32 531.71 -X PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY FOR THE DIFFERENT GAMES
utt_0066 utt 532.60 537.41 -X SINCE A RANDOM CLASSIFIER WOULD GIVE twenty-five PERCENT PERFORMANCE.
utt_0067 utt 539.20 550.05 -X THEN, PATTERNS START TO BE NOTICED IN WINDOWS OF one MINUTE, AND THEN, WE HAVE 'forty-four% ACCURACY',
utt_0068 utt 553.31 562.31 -X THEN 'forty-five'. THE ACCURACY STARTS TO SATURATE... WITH TIME WINDOWS SMALLER THAN ten SECONDS.
utt_0069 utt 562.31 570.91 -X SO THIS IS OUR BEST TABLE. WHEN WE GO FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS TABLE, IN THE LEFT AND
utt_0070 utt 570.91 581.54 -X RIGHT SIDE, WE ARE GOING FROM THE FRONTAL TO THE OCCIPITAL REGIONS OF THE BRAIN FROM BOTH SIDES.
utt_0071 utt 582.97 590.37 -X WE NOTICED THAT PATTERNS MAY ARISE, EVENTUALLY, IN BOTH HEMISPHERES OF THE BRAIN, AND NOT ONLY
utt_0072 utt 590.37 604.99 -X IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE AS EXPECTED IF WE CONSIDER EMOTIONS SEPARATELY BUT INDIVIDUALS ARE PLAYING GAMES SO THERE IS ACTIVITY IN ALL THE BRAIN AND WE NOTICE THAT IN THIS TABLE.
utt_0074 utt 606.69 613.73 -X ADDITIONALLY, WE NOTICE THAT THE MAIN... THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANNELS ARE THOSE RELATED
utt_0075 utt 613.76 623.24 -X TO MOTOR CONTROL (TO VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS OF HANDS AND FINGERS), FOLLOWED BY THE VISUAL AND AUDITORY
utt_0076 utt 625.63 631.84 -X CHANNELS. WELL, CHANNELS RELATED TO VISUAL PROCESSING AND AUDITION.
utt_0077 utt 633.95 637.96 -X WE ANALYZED THE BANDS OF THE FOURIER SPECTRUM.
utt_0078 utt 638.21 642.98 -X WE USED A SPEARMAN SCORE TO FIND MONOTONIC CORRELATION BETWEEN A BAND
utt_0079 utt 643.84 652.36 -X AND THE OUTPUT CLASS. WE RANK ALL THE ATTRIBUTES ACCORDING TO THIS SPEARMAN SCORE AND WE SUM THE
utt_0080 utt 656.35 666.40 -X twenty-eight ATTRIBUTES RELATED TO A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES. SO WE NOTICED THAT THE ALPHA BAND IS THE MOST
utt_0081 utt 667.14 677.06 -X PROMISING BAND OF THE SPECTRUM FOLLOWED BY THE DELTA BAND, WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE THE BAND
utt_0082 utt 677.06 685.22 -X OF ARTIFACTS (MOVEMENTS), BUT IN THIS SPECIFIC APPLICATION, MOVEMENTS AND ARTIFACTS IN FACT HELP
utt_0083 utt 686.18 691.49 -X THE RECOGNITION OF PATTERNS FOLLOWED BY THE THETA BAND.
utt_0084 utt 692.93 703.51 -X IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT WE COMBINE ALL THE one hundred and forty FEATURES AND THEN WE LEAVE FIVE FEATURES OUT AT
utt_0085 utt 705.73 714.05 -X A TIME. WE ACHIEVED THE BEST ACCURACY, seventy-two%, USING ALL THE FEATURES. WE HAVE A SMALL REDUCTION IN
utt_0086 utt 714.05 728.61 -X ACCURACY IN THE TOP OF THE TABLE AND, THEN, A HIGHER REDUCTION... A FASTER REDUCTION OF THE ACCURACY IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TABLE, WHICH MEANS THAT OUR FEATURE RANKING AND SELECTION MECHANISM
utt_0088 utt 728.67 738.15 -X IS WORKING WELL WE CAN ELIMINATE SOME FEATURES (SOME ATTRIBUTES) OF THE MODEL AND WE PAY A SMALL
utt_0089 utt 738.15 744.29 -X PRICE IN TERMS OF THE ACCURACY, BUT WE HAVE A MORE COMPACT MODEL THAT PROCESSES DATA FASTER.
utt_0090 utt 745.41 751.34 -X 'THIS GRAPH' SHOWS THAT MALE-FEMALE SHIFTS DO NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY THE CREATION OF NEW RULES.
utt_0091 utt 752.39 761.51 -X FOR EXAMPLE, 'HERE', A WOMAN IS USING THE EEG DEVICE. THEN, A MAN STARTED TO USE THE DEVICE,
utt_0092 utt 761.51 770.10 -X AND NO RULES WERE CREATED ON THAT SHIFT. SO SOME EXISTING RULES WERE UPDATED FOR THE NEW USER
utt_0093 utt 770.72 775.37 -X (WERE CUSTOMIZED FOR THE NEW USER).
utt_0094 utt 775.37 780.36 -X WE'VE APPLIED EGFC TO ONLINE LEARNING FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA STREAMS.
utt_0095 utt 780.52 791.88 -X THE INDIVIDUALS PLAYING GAMES WERE SUBJECT TO VISUAL AND AUDITORY STIMULI. WE ANALYZED AREAS OF THE BRAIN, LENGTHS OF TIME WINDOWS, AND DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION.
utt_0097 utt 792.04 797.80 -X WE NOTICED THAT BOTH BRAIN HEMISPHERES MAY ASSIST PATTERN RECOGNITION, EVENTUALLY,
utt_0098 utt 798.02 812.97 -X BUT THE MOST PROMISING REGIONS OF THE BRAIN ARE THE FRONTAL (THE MOTOR REGION), AND THE VISUAL AND AUDITORY PARTS OF THE BRAIN, IN THE OCCIPITAL AND TEMPORAL AREAS.
utt_0100 utt 813.28 820.87 -X THE MOST PROMISING BAND (RANGE OF VALUES) IN THE FOURIER SPECTRUM IS THE RANGE FROM eight TO thirteen
utt_0101 utt 821.77 826.67 -X HERTZ. EGFC ACHIEVED ITS BEST ACCURACY, seventy-two%,
utt_0102 utt 827.85 834.15 -X USING A COMPACT RULE-BASED STRUCTURE AND TIME WINDOWS OF ten SECONDS.
utt_0103 utt 835.81 846.54 -X WE WILL, IN THE FUTURE, EVALUATE EGFC IN OTHER BENCHMARK DATASETS. WE'LL USE A DEEP NEURAL NETWORK TO EXTRACT FEATURES AND COMBINE THIS WITH
utt_0105 utt 846.69 853.26 -3.0758 EGFC TO LEARN ONLINE. AND WE'LL ALSO CONSIDER IMAGES COMBINED TO EEG DATA.
