utt_0000 utt 30.16 37.43 -X HI EVERYONE, TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT ARTICULEV: AN INTEGRATED SELF-ASSEMBLY PIPELINE FOR ARTICULATED MULTI-BEAD LEVITATION PRIMITIVES.
utt_0001 utt 37.43 43.51 -X THE AUTHORS OF THIS WORK ARE MYSELF, ANDREAS FENDER, AND DIEGO MARTINEZ PLASENCIA, AND SRIRAM SUBRAMANIAN.
utt_0002 utt 43.51 48.92 -X BEFORE TALKING ABOUT THIS WORK, I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY INTRODUCE ACOUSTIC LEVITATION BASED ON PREVIOUS WORK.
utt_0003 utt 48.92 55.83 -X THE MOST COMMON APPROACH FOR ACOUSTIC LEVITATION IS TO USE TWO TRANSDUCER ARRAYS - ONE IN THE TOP AND ONE IN THE BOTTOM.
utt_0004 utt 55.83 60.44 -X ALL TRANSDUCERS TOGETHER GENERATE AN ACOUSTIC PRESSURE FIELD THAT CAN TRAP PARTICLES IN MID-AIR.
utt_0005 utt 60.56 66.84 -X THE RELATIVE PHASE DELAYS OF THE TRANSDUCERS CAN BE ADJUSTED IN REAL-TIME TO MOVE THE PARTICLES IN THREE DIMENSIONS.
utt_0006 utt 66.84 79.13 -X BASED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY, HCI RESEARCHERS STARTED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL BY DESIGNING INTERACTION TECHNIQUES… …AND BY BUILDING NOVEL threeD DISPLAYS, FOR INSTANCE, BY COMBINING ACOUSTIC LEVITATION WITH PROJECTION MAPPING.
utt_0008 utt 79.13 85.27 -X BY MOVING INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES AT HIGH SPEEDS, THE PERSISTENCE-OF-VISION EFFECT CAN BE UTILIZED TO CREATE VOLUMETRIC DISPLAYS.
utt_0010 utt 90.68 92.86 -X WE REFER TO THOSE AS “LEVITATION PRIMITIVES”.
utt_0011 utt 92.86 97.40 -X THE MOST COMMON APPROACH IS TO USE INDIVIDUAL BEADS TO DISPLAY INTERACTIVE PHYSICALIZED CONTENT.
utt_0012 utt 97.40 104.51 -X SUCH BEADS CAN ALSO BE CONNECTED VIA THREADS, FOR INSTANCE TO USE THEM FOR PHYSICALIZED DATA VISUALIZATION AS SHOWN IN “FLOATING CHARTS”.
utt_0013 utt 104.51 108.76 -X BEADS CAN ALSO BE ATTACHED TO CLOTH… …OR USED IN A PERSISTENCE-OF-VISION-BASED APPROACH.
utt_0015 utt 108.76 112.12 -X THOSE WORKS DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF EACH OF THE PRIMITIVES.
utt_0016 utt 112.12 118.21 -X HOWEVER, AN OFTEN-OVERLOOKED ASPECT OF LEVITATION-BASED DISPLAYS IS THE INITIALIZATION OF THE PHYSICAL CONTENT.
utt_0017 utt 118.21 125.37 -X IN THIS CONTEXT, INITIALIZATION MEANS TO PHYSICALLY TRANSPORT THE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES TO THEIR TARGET LOCATION BEFORE THE APPLICATION CAN RUN.
utt_0018 utt 125.37 131.84 -X WHILE SOME WORKS HAVE SPECIALIZED SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR TYPE OF PRIMITIVE, THERE IS NO GENERALIZED APPROACH FOR COMBINING THOSE PRIMITIVES SEAMLESSLY.
utt_0019 utt 131.84 138.85 -X WITH ARTICULEV, WE PROPOSE A GENERALIZED MODULAR ACOUSTIC LEVITATION PIPELINE THAT ALLOWS TO COMBINE DIFFERENT LEVITATION PRIMITIVES.
utt_0020 utt 138.85 145.38 -X THE PIPELINE ALSO SUPPORTS FULLY ARTICULATED SHAPES, WHICH MEANS THAT HIERARCHICAL ROTATIONS CAN BE APPLIED WITHIN THE LEVITATING STRUCTURES.
utt_0021 utt 145.60 150.14 -X MULTIPLE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES CAN ALSO BE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE ARTICULATED SHAPE.
utt_0022 utt 150.56 154.40 -X WE IMPLEMENTED AN INSTANCE OF THE ARTICULEV PIPELINE AS A UNITYthreeD PLUGIN.
utt_0023 utt 154.62 160.80 -X DEVELOPERS SIMPLY NEED TO DEFINE THE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES, POSITION THEM AND POSSIBLY IMPLEMENT THEIR ANIMATIONS AND BEHAVIOR.
utt_0024 utt 160.80 167.43 -X ARTICULEV THEN TAKES CARE OF PHYSICALLY TRANSFORMING THE PRIMITIVES INSIDE THE LEVITATOR BY GENERATING THE UNDERLYING ACOUSTIC TRAPS.
utt_0025 utt 167.43 172.80 -X THE LEVITATOR WE USE IN OUR PIPELINE IMPLEMENTATION IS INSPIRED BY PREVIOUS WORK WITH TWO TRANSDUCER ARRAYS.
utt_0026 utt 172.80 177.96 -X WE USE ACOUSTICALLY TRANSPARENT FELT ABOVE THE BOTTOM ARRAY TO PUT THE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES ONTO.
utt_0027 utt 177.96 182.34 -X FOR DETECTING THE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES, WE USE THREE OPTITRACK FLEX thirteen CAMERAS.
utt_0028 utt 182.78 184.93 -X NOW LET’S TALK ABOUT THE PIPELINE ITSELF.
utt_0029 utt 184.93 191.88 -X FOR THIS, WE WILL USE AN ARTICULATED SHAPE AS AN EXAMPLE: A PIECE OF CLOTH AND TWO THREADS THAT CAN ROTATE AROUND TWO ANCHOR POINTS.
utt_0030 utt 191.88 201.41 -X TO SUPPORT A SHAPE LIKE THIS, THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO PROVIDE THE TOPOLOGY OF THE STRUCTURE, WHICH INVOLVES SPECIFYING HOW THE BEADS ARE CONNECTED AND THEIR HIERARCHY FOR ARTICULATED MOVEMENTS.
utt_0031 utt 201.41 207.27 -X THIS TARGET SHAPE DEFINITION AND THE APPLICATION LOGIC FOR THE SHAPE CAN THEN BE DEPLOYED IN A LEVITATOR TO RUN THE PIPELINE.
utt_0032 utt 207.27 209.99 -X THE ARTICULEV PIPELINE CAN BE SPLIT INTO THREE STAGES:
utt_0033 utt 209.99 212.14 -X THE FIRST IS THE “ANALYZE” STAGE.
utt_0034 utt 212.14 214.31 -X HERE WE DETECT THE BEADS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS.
utt_0035 utt 214.31 218.79 -X WE THEN MATCH THOSE WITH THE TARGET SHAPE PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER (HERE DEPICTED IN GREEN).
utt_0036 utt 218.79 226.28 -X THE SECOND STAGE IS THE “ASSEMBLE” STAGE, IN WHICH THE LEVITATION PRIMITIVES ARE LIFTED, MERGED AND THEN TRANSFORMED TO THE TARGET POSE.
utt_0037 utt 226.28 229.51 -X IN THE “ANIMATE” STAGE, THE STRUCTURE IS TRANSFORMED IN REAL-TIME.
utt_0038 utt 229.51 237.13 -X THIS IS STILL RUNNING IN UNITY, SO THE DEVELOPER CAN FREELY COMBINE THIS WITH threeD INPUT DEVICES LIKE KINECT OR OUTPUT DEVICES LIKE PROJECTORS.
utt_0039 utt 237.19 240.72 -X THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE WAS ASSEMBLED FROM THREE SEPARATE PRIMITIVES.
utt_0040 utt 240.72 246.41 -X GENERALLY, ARTICULATED SHAPES CAN BE A PRE-ASSEMBLED SINGLE PROP OR ASSEMBLED IN MID-AIR BY MERGING TRAPS.
utt_0041 utt 246.41 249.26 -X THIS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE FOR THE DEVELOPER OF THE TARGET SHAPE.
utt_0042 utt 249.26 255.31 -X HOWEVER, THE SHAPES BEHAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY DURING PHYSICAL ARTICULATED MOVEMENTS AS CAN BE SEEN IN THIS COMPARISON.
utt_0043 utt 256.97 260.43 -X THE PRIMITIVES THEMSELVES CAN ALSO BE PRE-CUT INTO SHAPES.
utt_0044 utt 260.43 266.48 -X DETECTING BEAD TOPOLOGIES IS THEN NOT ENOUGH. WE ALSO NEED TO RECONSTRUCT THE EXACT SHAPES OF THE CLOTH CUTOUTS.
utt_0045 utt 266.48 274.41 -X IN THIS CASE, THE DEVELOPER ADDITIONALLY NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN IMAGE OF THE SHAPE SO THAT ARTICULEV CAN MATCH THEM WITH THEIR CORRECT TARGET AND ORIENTATION.
utt_0046 utt 274.41 278.45 -4.2988 GIVEN THIS TOOLSET, DEVELOPERS CAN FREELY MIX VARIOUS LEVITATION PRIMITIVES.
